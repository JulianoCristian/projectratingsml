However, the issue of persistent local\n            budgetary shortfalls, should have been proactively pursued.\n            The performance of the borrower is likewise satisfactory, in\n            particular, that of the implementing agency, which can be\n            rated as highly satisfactory. The key lessons convey the\n            need for long-term commitment by donors, and borrowers for\n            supporting this kind of operation, which requires increased\n            outreach, and effective future programs, and, suggest a\n            planned series of follow-up projects. To an extent, the\n            success of the project is attributable to one Project\n            Director being responsible during the project period, thus\n            reinforcing staff continuity. If seasonal activities, or\n            community participation are involved, planning ahead for\n            timely release of funds becomes critical, or a year's\n            loss due to late forestry planting, or pasture development\n            will occur. The withdrawal of subsidies for a free\n            environment, is welcomed by beneficiaries, provided those\n            are preceded by support services, reinforcing that natural\n            resources conservation, succeeds upon the assumption of\n            community protection, and responsibility, who value\n            training, and management practices

resources in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), which ranks\n            with the country's poorest and most environmentally\n            fragile areas. The project has three broad fronts:  (i)\n            improving the policy framework within AJK for the use of\n            land resources; (ii) restructuring and strengthening the\n            main institutions that help manage and protect the land\n            resources in AJK; and (iii) testing, on a pilot basis,\n            programs whereby communities take full responsibility for\n            planning and implementation of activities covering land\n            resources in the communities.  Under (i) above, input\n            production and distribution programs will be phased out\n            through a program for transfer of these activities to the\n            private sector.  Associated with the transfer is a program\n            for the phased elimination of subsidies on inputs.  The\n            specific activities for transfer and subsidy removal are\n            production of vegetable seed, seed potato, fruit tree and\n            forest tree seedling production; field crop seed, and\n            fertilizer distribution and poultry vaccination.  Changes\n            will also be made to the current practices and policies that\n            apply to community approaches to the management of communal\n            lands.  Under (ii), the project will restructure and\n            streamline the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the\n            Department of Animal Husbandry (DOAH), and the Department of\n            Forestry (DOF). The effect of these measures is an overall\n            net reduction in public sector staff.  The Planning and\n            Economic Services will be moderately expanded to enable\n            analysis, planning, monitoring and evaluation.  A Social\n            Forestry Wing will be added to DOF to assist in community\n            participatory approaches to management of communal lands,\n            extension training, soil conservation and range management.\n            AJK's Planning and Development Department will be\n            supported by staff for environmental screening and land use\n            planning.
