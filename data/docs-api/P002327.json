The Bank\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory, given a weak design,\n            inadequate supervision - particularly in terms of skills mix\n            - and, implementation problems, which regardless of the\n            rightful decision to suspend disbursements, four years\n            elapsed until effectively setting the Senegalese Association\n            for the Promotion of Small Rural Development Projects as the\n            new implementing agency. Likewise, performance by the\n            Borrower is assessed as unsatisfactory, in light of costly\n            implementation interruptions, which led to poor financial\n            management practices, in addition to undue political\n            interference conducive to below par subprojects. A number of\n            well known generic lessons are drawn from the project,\n            namely, the need for a project design, suitable for local\n            implementation capacities; the need for full beneficiary\n            participation in design, and implementation; clearly defined\n            accountability, and responsibility within a detailed\n            implementation plan; and, the critical need for adequate\n            management, monitoring, and reporting systems. Additionally,\n            implementation delays do not necessarily increase investment\n            costs, but it does reduce financial, and economic returns,\n            de-motivating investor confidence; and, lack of serious\n            government commitment should preclude restructuring of an operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Second Small Rural Operations Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Second Small Rural\n            Operations Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/06/729147/senegal-second-small-rural-operations-project","projn":"SN-Small Rural Ops.

As\n            such it will continue the process of channelling funds and\n            technical services to small groups of rural people, who will\n            provide labor and some cash for the development of several\n            types of productive activities. The project introduces\n            various producer groups to new technology and new activities\n            and reinforces the local capacity for identification and\n            preparation of small rural projects. Eight subprojects have\n            been appraised, covering cereal, vegetable, fruit and honey\n            production in different regions of the country. The project\n            will finance land development works, irrigation systems and\n            equipment, vehicles, inputs, training of farmer groups and\n            staff, and operating costs of subprojects and a management\n            unit.
