The lessons learned\n            indicate that exclusive rights should be awarded\n            competitively - this applies to virtually all commercial\n            activities including exploration and production,\n            transportation, and distribution. As this Project very well\n            illustrates, without the benefit of tendering, agreements\n            have to be negotiated in detail, a lengthy and costly\n            process, without reference points or benchmarks. One should\n            have recognized at appraisal that developing a national oil\n            company required considerable capital, skills and experience\n            that for all practical purposes, are unaffordable for\n            Mozambique. Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos de\n            Mozambique (Mozambique Electricity Company) (ENH) hired very\n            qualified advisers, at a considerable expense, to strengthen\n            its capabilities, but whether this was sufficient to best\n            defend the national interest is a matter of debate. ENH\n            totally depended on its external advisers to appraise and\n            negotiate the transactions. Irrespective of their\n            performance, it does not appear that there was a substantial\n            transfer of skills particularly in the business aspects of\n            petroleum Joint Ventures. Had Mozambique given exclusive\n            rights to a private party in a concession in which the State\n            intends to invest prior to the submission of the Project to\n            the Board, the advisability of such a proposition would have\n            been heavily questioned within the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Gas Engineering Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Gas Engineering Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3272682/mozambique-gas-engineering-project","projn":"MZ-Gas Engineering (Engy) -- P001780","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Energy and Environment,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Oil & Gas,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Mozambique","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040427134820"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Oil and gas","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adverse impact,closure,Coal,coal\n            reserves,construction,distribution of gas,domestic\n            use,drilling,Electricity,Electricity Company,electricity\n            generation,environmental assessment,environmental\n            health,environmental standards,exclusive rights,fuel,Gas,Gas\n            Act,gas development,gas development project,gas\n            distribution,gas distribution network,gas exports,gas\n            field,gas fields,gas market,gas operations,Gas Pipeline,Gas\n            Pipeline Company,gas price,gas processing,gas production,gas\n            reserves,gas resources,Gas Sales,gas sector,gas supplies,gas\n            transmission,gas transmission pipeline,hydrocarbon\n            sector,Hydrocarbons,income,iron,iron ore,Mineral,Mineral\n            Resources,National Oil,natural gas,natural gas trade,natural\n            resources,Oil and gas,oil companies,oil company,oil\n            industry,petrochemical industry,petroleum,Petroleum\n            Law,petroleum sector,Pollution,power generation,power\n            utility,privatization,project management,quarterly reports,steel,Sustainability,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"adverse impact,closure,Coal,coal\n            reserves,construction,distribution of gas,domestic\n            use,drilling,Electricity,Electricity Company,electricity\n            generation,environmental assessment,environmental\n            health,environmental standards,exclusive rights,fuel,Gas,Gas\n            Act,gas development,gas development project,gas\n            distribution,gas distribution network,gas exports,gas\n            field,gas fields,gas market,gas operations,Gas Pipeline,Gas\n            Pipeline Company,gas price,gas processing,gas production,gas\n            reserves,gas resources,Gas Sales,gas sector,gas supplies,gas\n            transmission,gas transmission pipeline,hydrocarbon\n            sector,Hydrocarbons,income,iron,iron ore,Mineral,Mineral\n            Resources,National Oil,natural gas,natural gas trade,natural\n            resources,Oil and gas,oil companies,oil company,oil\n            industry,petrochemical industry,petroleum,Petroleum\n            Law,petroleum sector,Pollution,power generation,power\n            utility,privatization,project management,quarterly reports,steel,Sustainability,wells"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020350-DANISH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020460-NORWEGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF024310-USTDP CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF026530-TAGPE - ENVIR.
