The Closing Date for Mali\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant, which is part of\n            the second phase of a regional project, will be extended\n            from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012. This will be the\n            third and last extension of the project for a cumulative\n            total of 28 months. Delays occurred during the first\n            extension of 22 months mainly because: (i) an abbreviated\n            resettlement action plan was required and its preparation\n            took time and delayed the disposal activities of obsolete\n            pesticides; and (ii) the procurement of a disposal company\n            for the cleanup of obsolete pesticides took longer than\n            expected including the finalization of the bid evaluation\n            report, as well as the approval and signing of the contract\n            which had to be done at the minister level given the size of\n            the contract. Then, the project was interrupted following\n            the military coup of March 22, 2012 and the suspension of\n            operations in accordance with which is still in effect. As a\n            result, no withdrawal application has been processed since\n            March 22, 2012 and project implementation has been\n            interrupted, until further notice. The extension of closing\n            date is necessary to allow time for the possible resumption\n            of operations depending on the conclusions and\n            recommendations of the Operational Procedures (OP) 7.30\n            assessment mission scheduled in June 2012, and the\n            finalization of all planned priority project activities\n            interrupted in March

objectives: 1) to eliminate\n            stockpiles of obsolete pesticides in Africa; 2) to\n            contribute to the prevention of recurrence; 3) to contribute\n            to the protection of human health and the environment\n            exposed to Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs); and 4) to\n            contribute to the conservation of biodiversity, reduction of\n            land degradation and water protection. To date, this program\n            is the only international and inter-agency initiative that\n            has as its major function the cleaning and disposal of\n            obsolete pesticides in an entire region. The project may\n            cause many negative impacts including: a) The possible\n            evacuation of affected populations; b) The emanation of\n            odors and toxic fumes; c) The emission of dust; d)\n            Respiratory damage to inhabitants; e) Contamination of soil,\n            vegetation, air and water resources in case of large leaks;\n            f) The risk of explosion, fire, burns and poisoning, and; g)\n            Nuisance to local residents (smoke, odors, dust). During the\n            implementation of the measures recommended complaints may\n            arise and delay the process. Also, to address these\n            situations, several procedures for resolving disputes and\n            arbitration misunderstanding exist including: a) use\n            amicable discussions with well-known individuals; b)\n            recourse through arbitration at the municipality level; and\n            3) the courts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - First Phase of the Africa Stockpiles\n            Program Project : resettlement plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - First Phase of the Africa\n            Stockpiles Program Project : resettlement plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/11/14250575/mali-first-phase-africa-stockpiles-program-project-resettlement-plan","projn":"3A-Africa Stockpiles Programme - Project 1\n            (Mali, Morocco And Tanz -- P103189","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Gender and Law,Food & Beverage Industry,Regional Rural Development,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Wastewater Treatment","teratopic":"Rural Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Transport,Gender,Industry","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110526021111"},"theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Law reform,Other environment and natural resources management,Pollution management and environmental health,Other social protection and risk management","subsc":"Solid waste management,Central government administration,Other industry,Petrochemicals and fertilizers","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Transport,Gender,Industry","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, air, CA, emergency services,\n            hazards, Labelling, packaging, pedestrians, pesticide,\n            Pesticides, road, roads, Route, Sanitation, soils, storm\n            sewers, supervision, transport, trucks, vehicle, vehicles,\n            waste, wastes, wetlands, will"}},"owner":"Envir & Nat.
