The main objectives of the project\n            were as follows: (a) the ability of the country to meet\n            power demand at least cost; (b) the pricing of electricity\n            at full economical and financial cost; and (c) the\n            maintenance of the sector's financial  viability.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: (a) a technical assistance project to advance\n            project design preparation can be extremely useful to the\n            implementation of the least-cost power development plan; (b)\n            a pre-payment metering system can be a very effective way to\n            both improve power company finances and encourage customers\n            to conserve electricity; (c) minimize the need for contract\n            extensions and detect errors in operations; (d) a technical\n            assistance project can be useful to continuing the dialogue\n            between the Bank and the Borrower on important sector issues\n            while a large investment project is under preparation; and\n            (e) data clean-up and consolidation for billing and\n            accounting systems can be very time consuming."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -
