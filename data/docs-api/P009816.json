On\n            approximately 48,000 ha of consolidated land, the OFD works\n            would be built during the project. To test improved MIP and\n            canal system performance, a Research, Development and\n            Training Cell is being established to undertake pilot\n            studies. In addition, there are a number of coordinating\n            units being established to insure that all State Government\n            departments and research institutions are actively involved\n            in the success of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Orissa Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second Orissa Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/05/725335/india-second-orissa-irrigation-project","projn":"IN-Orissa Medium Irrig. -- P009816","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Drylands & Desertification,Water Conservation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810190102558"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Engineering,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            growth,Agricultural Intensification,Agricultural\n            Markets,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,agricultural\n            research,agricultural technology,Agriculture,alluvial\n            soils,Audits,canals,channel,channels,clay,climatic\n            conditions,construction,cooperatives,Crop,Crop\n            Production,crop yields,cropping,cropping\n            intensity,cultivation,Dam,Dam\n            Safety,dates,Deltas,Development Banks,development\n            projects,discharge,diversified\n            cropping,diversion,drainage,Dry season,Environmental\n            Impact,equipment,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizer,fertilizer\n            use,fertilizers,Food Production,foundation\n            seed,groundnut,groundwater,high yielding\n            varieties,high-yielding\n            varieties,income,incomes,Irrigation,irrigation systems,labor\n            force,Land Development,landless\n            laborers,lands,maize,manures,moisture,nitrogen,nutrients,Oilseeds,organic\n            matter,Paddy,plains,plant protection,power\n            generation,produce,Production of\n            rice,programs,pulses,R&D,Rainfall,rainfed\n            crops,reservoirs,rice,Rice production,Rice Research,rice\n            yields,Rural Development,sea,seed,severe drought,Soil,Soil\n            Types,Soils,T & V system,tubewells,UNDP,United\n            Nations,vegetables,vegetation,Water Charges,water\n            distribution,water holding capacity,Water Management,Water\n            Requirements,water resources,water storage,Water Supply,watercourses,weirs,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Engineering,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            growth,Agricultural Intensification,Agricultural\n            Markets,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,agricultural\n            research,agricultural technology,Agriculture,alluvial\n            soils,Audits,canals,channel,channels,clay,climatic\n            conditions,construction,cooperatives,Crop,Crop\n            Production,crop yields,cropping,cropping\n            intensity,cultivation,Dam,Dam\n            Safety,dates,Deltas,Development Banks,development\n            projects,discharge,diversified\n            cropping,diversion,drainage,Dry season,Environmental\n            Impact,equipment,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizer,fertilizer\n            use,fertilizers,Food Production,foundation\n            seed,groundnut,groundwater,high yielding\n            varieties,high-yielding\n            varieties,income,incomes,Irrigation,irrigation systems,labor\n            force,Land Development,landless\n            laborers,lands,maize,manures,moisture,nitrogen,nutrients,Oilseeds,organic\n            matter,Paddy,plains,plant protection,power\n            generation,produce,Production of\n            rice,programs,pulses,R&D,Rainfall,rainfed\n            crops,reservoirs,rice,Rice production,Rice Research,rice\n            yields,Rural Development,sea,seed,severe drought,Soil,Soil\n            Types,Soils,T & V system,tubewells,UNDP,United\n            Nations,vegetables,vegetation,Water Charges,water\n            distribution,water holding capacity,Water Management,Water\n            Requirements,water resources,water storage,Water Supply,watercourses,weirs,wheat"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"4448"},"facets":{}}}
