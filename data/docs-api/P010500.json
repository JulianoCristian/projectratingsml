This report\n            highlights the major results of the first eight months of\n            the implementation of the Action Plan: 1) Significant\n            progress has been made to address the harsh conditions of\n            the population living in the area. Direct actions to\n            alleviate poverty are in place through an inclusive\n            consultation process with the communities; 2) A rapid\n            assessment of ecological and livelihood conditions of the\n            \"dhands\" in the vicinity of the outfall system has\n            progressed less than expected; 3) Progress has been made in\n            assessing and improving local government flood management\n            systems. The assessment was carried in April/May, 2007 and\n            discussed with the Government; 4) Progress has been made in\n            carrying out an assessment of the functionality of the\n            outfall system as well as in implementing the most urgent\n            repairs; and 5) Appraisal and negotiations of the Sindh\n            Water Sector Improvement Project (WSIP) have been completed\n            in March, 2007 and Board presentation is expected in\n            September, 2007. Management believes that while immediate\n            actions have been taken to address the main issues affecting\n            the area as a consequence of the floods of 2003 and 2006,\n            flood risks in the coastal zone of the Indus river system\n            will continue to be high."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

The overall outcome of the project was rated\n            unsatisfactory, and the performance of the Bank and the\n            borrower was also rated as unsatisfactory. The major factors\n            affecting the implementation and outcome of the project are\n            as follows: (i) the record storms of a cyclone in 1998 and\n            2002 resulted in extensive flooding in the lower parts of\n            the coastal areas; (ii) the persistent drought for over 4\n            years reduced the waterlogged area and emphasis shifted\n            towards increasing irrigation supplies instead of drainage;\n            (iii) there was reluctance in government circles to follow\n            the agreed Framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n            (FLAR), which delayed the subprojects requiring land\n            acquisition, and in many cases precluded their\n            implementation; (iv) absence of a first year's program\n            in all provinces except Sindh as no projects, except the\n            remaining works of Nara canal in Sindh, were ready for\n            implementation in the initial stages of NDP, project\n            preparation activity started only in 1998 and initially only\n            the leftover works can be implemented and no new subprojects\n            can be implemented in the first year; and (v) changing\n            priorities and frequent additions and deletions of schemes\n            by the provinces resulted in too many revisions of rolling\n            plans, unproductive preparation of subprojects by\n            consultants and implementation delays. Lessons learned: (a)\n            good sector work prior to appraisal and coordination between\n            donors can be very valuable in assisting governments to\n            embark on correct, but politically difficult sector\n            policies, planning processes must utilize a more\n            consultative and participatory process in which all risks\n            and options as well as tradeoffs are made explicit and\n            considered by stakeholders and policy makers jointly; and\n            (b) strong environmental work is needed for implementing\n            complex projects. Environmental objectives and the intrinsic\n            and human environmental values that are important for the\n            livelihoods of direct and indirect beneficiaries need to be\n            an integral part of the framework for formulating plans,\n            designing projects, and evaluating tradeoffs and risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

The section also contains a\n            description of project status and evolution. Section IV\n            discusses issues of particular relevance to the Request,\n            including the Left Bank Outfall Drain, the Tidal Link and\n            Cholri Weir, and NDP project issues. Section V recommends\n            actions, and Section VI concludes the main text. Annex 1\n            presents the Requestors' claims, together with\n            Management's detailed responses, in table format. Eight\n            other annexes provide background, and other pertinent\n            information. The Requestors allege that the project violates\n            Bank policies regarding adherence to Pakistan's\n            requirements under international environmental treaties and\n            agreements, as well as adversely affecting marginalized and\n            vulnerable indigenous peoples, and cultural and historical\n            sites, and so fails to adhere to Bank policies regarding\n            involuntary settlement, or to engage the local community in\n            meaningful participation. The Requestors ask for an\n            investigation and recommendations to correct the harm and\n            bring the project into compliance with Bank policy.

The Requestors claim more than 50 villages will\n            suffer the permanent threat of flooding from the disposal of\n            upstream saline effluents if the existing Left Bank Outfall\n            Drain system  - which they allege is faulty - is further\n            expanded under the NDP. They also claim that the National\n            Surface Drainage System and the use of the disposal system\n            through the Tidal Link is not sustainable, because the Tidal\n            Link's failure has already caused the loss of thousands\n            of acres of land. The Requesters further state that the\n            super engineering ideas [that] have been used against the\n            natural flows are causing them harm, while the alternate\n            project options or disposal systems, which are historical\n            natural disposal systems, have been ignored. Further they\n            claim the proposed drainage network will badly affect the\n            already degraded environment of Indus Delta, by the absence\n            of fresh water, essential for coastal forests and marine\n            life; by the disposal of toxic drainage effluents that will\n            destroy the remaining resources of marine fisheries and\n            mangrove forests; and by the drainage effluent that contains\n            not only saline sub-soil water but also residual traces of\n            pesticides, fertilizer, and industrial waste accumulated\n            along the way. The Requestors also claim that blockage of\n            the flow of effluent causes the effluent to seep into both\n            sides of the Kadhan Pateji Outfall Drain, which negatively\n            affects groundwater quality, a single drinking source, thus\n            causing severe impact on human health. Also threatened are\n            two coastal wetlands, protected areas significant for\n            migratory birds and other significant biodiversity and\n            ecosystem values. The Requestors allege that the project\n            violates Bank policies regarding adherance to\n            Pakistan's requirements under international\n            environmental treaties and agreements, as well as adversely\n            affecting marginalized and vulnerable indigenous peoples,\n            and cultural and historical sites, and fails to adhere to\n            Bank policies regarding involuntary settlement or to engage\n            the local community in meaningful participation.
