The report notes\n            the complexity of implementing a far reaching restructuring\n            of the railways, particularly when staff retrenchment and\n            reduction in passenger services is required; it requires a\n            significant amount political capital and can be greatly\n            affected by political instability. Other significant lessons\n            cited include: the need to maintain consistent focus and\n            pressure on the reform in order to assist the Government\n            with weathering political pressures and prevent backsliding;\n            the need to involve the labor unions early and obtain their\n            views on the retrenchment process; and the need to prepare\n            public opinion gradually for the curtailment of the most\n            expensive services. Although there was a genuine commitment\n            to the project by both the Borrower and the Implementation\n            Agency there were also differences in opinions with the Bank\n            about how to interpret project development objectives, which\n            affected the implementation. The following lessons should be\n            addressed in future projects: It is important for the Bank\n            to get a clear agreement from the Government on the kind of\n            railways the country wants to have and can afford; the\n            incumbent railways cannot reasonably be expected to drive\n            the process without strong Government leadership. When\n            higher Government functionaries are made members of the\n            Supervisory Board of the railways, their position should be\n            treated \"ex officio\"; otherwise, the presence of\n            these representatives can seriously diminish the capacities\n            of the Ministries to provide oversight and to provide\n            critical comment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Railway Modernization and\n            Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Railway Modernization\n            and Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6624946/croatia-railway-modernization-restructuring-project","projn":"HR-Railway Modernization & Restructuring\n            Project -- P039161","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Business Environment,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Railways Transport","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Croatia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060228114710"},"subsc":"Other social services,Railways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, Auditing, autonomy, benefit\n            analysis, cars, corridor, cross subsidization, diesel\n            locomotives, direct financing, drainage, electric\n            locomotives, employment, filling stations, financial\n            management, financial performance, fiscal reform, Freight,\n            Freight traffic, freight transport, freight transport\n            market, freight wagon fleet, Freight Wagons, fuel, housing,\n            inflation, Institutional Development, labor costs, laws,\n            legal provisions, Legislation, local authorities, Local\n            governments, locomotives, Mobility, Net Present Value,\n            operating efficiency, Passenger, passenger cars, Passenger\n            Coaches, passenger services, Present Value, privatization,\n            productivity, profitability, PSO, Public Service Obligation,\n            rail, rail infrastructure, rails, RAILWAY, railway\n            infrastructure, railway management, railway projects,\n            railway reform, Railway restructuring, railway sector,\n            Railways, Rate of Return, recycling, rolling stock, Routes,\n            savings, severance payments, sharing, shunting locomotives,\n            social services, speed, subsidiaries, subsidiary, tamping,\n            taxation, Track, trade unions, traffic, traffic volume,\n            trains, Transport, transport projects, urban services,\n            wages, welding, working ratio"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF022591-PHRD-IND.TECH.FOR PRIVATE\n            SECTOR DEVELOP,TF029316-PHRD - RAILWAY PROJECT,TF034530-CROATIA - RAILWAY REHABILITATION,TF035339-CROATIA - RAILWAY\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF035849-CROATIA - RAILWAY\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF035850-CROATIA - RAILWAY\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF036618-CROATIA - RAILWAY\n            REHABILITATION AND RESTRUCTURING,TF037516-CROATIA - RAILWAY MOD.
