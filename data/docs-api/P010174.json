The\n            project fully accomplished its objectives, its impact has\n            been substantial, sustainability is likely, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, a competent,\n            adequately staffed project team must be established in the\n            early stage of project execution. Second, use of capable and\n            experienced engineering and construction contractors should\n            be carefully planned and carried out. Third, bonus and\n            penalty clauses in engineering and construction contracts\n            should be carefully used to expedite project execution.\n            Fourth, cumbersome government/company procedures need to be\n            streamlined for early clearance of project design and\n            procurement recommendations. Fifth, intensive technical\n            supervision by the Bank is necessary at the stage of project\n            design and bidding by engineering contractors. Sixth,\n            participation of experienced expatriate consultants through\n            technical assistance agreements helps coordination of the\n            activities of various contractors and vendors in the course\n            of project execution. Seventh, adequate training of\n            personnel is necessary. Eighth, assignment of company\n            personnel to the offices of engineering and construction\n            contractors is essential. Lastly, recruitment of competent\n            staff with competitive compensation scales is essential to\n            ensure smooth project execution and operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fertilizer Industry\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -
