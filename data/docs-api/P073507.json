enhance efforts that should lead\n            to the mobilization of more resources, and faster economic\n            recovery in The Republic of Congo.

Mitigation measures - outside the control\n            of this project - include support to a comprehensive\n            disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program,\n            through political dialogue, and willingness to implement\n            reforms.
