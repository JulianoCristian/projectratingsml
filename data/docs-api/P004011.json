Several lessons address the\n            following. The modest incremental resources brought by the\n            project, not sufficient to resolve systemic institutional\n            issues in research, extension, supervision, and maintenance\n            of rural works, farm credit, livestock health, and local\n            government finance, among others, reinforces the need for a\n            focused, simple project design. Conceptually, it is more\n            attractive to have an integrated approach, but experience\n            suggests the approach is sometimes difficult to implement,\n            often unnecessary, as this case conveys, research support\n            was not required given research programs had been given\n            adequate support. This is why a flexible project management,\n            able to adjust implementation timing, while balancing\n            project activities, could have eased the difficult\n            interagency coordination, as well as a timely project\n            restructuring. Regarding project implementation,\n            community-based civil works, such as village roads, small\n            bridges, village irrigation canals, and village water\n            supply, while appreciated by beneficiaries, the maintenance\n            of such infrastructure has often been unsatisfactory,\n            because it is often regarded by the community as project\n            activities, as if maintenance belongs to local governments.\n            And, despite success in pioneering aspects of\n            community-managed micro-finance to the poor following\n            restructuring, much still needs to be done to ensure\n            financial sustainability, and institutional independence\n            from government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
