Total War Against HIV and AIDS\n            (TOWA) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Total War Against HIV and AIDS\n            (TOWA) Project for Kenya received a satisfactory outcome\n            rating with substantial risk to development outcome. Both\n            the Bank and the Borrower received satisfactory performance\n            ratings respectively. The first (level 2) restructuring: (i)\n            reallocated funds to continue to enable the increased\n            disbursement percentage from IDA to adjust for planned DFIF\n            co-financing not becoming available, and (ii) enabled the\n            urgent purchase of additional bed nets for the malaria\n            program. The second (level-1) restructuring was to: (i) make\n            up for the funds from Department for International\n            Development (DFID), which was not going to be available as\n            co-financing, to fund the fourth and fifth call for proposal\n            (CfPs); (ii) allocate another significant amount to scale up\n            the malaria bed net program and help attain universal\n            coverage of bed nets in the high malaria risk areas of the\n            country; (iii) support the project restructuring and restore\n            some of the funding, and (iv) extend the project for another\n            18 months, particularly to continue fiduciary and monitoring\n            and evaluation strengthening, and to achieve the revised\n            PDO. The third restructuring (level 2) was to extend the\n            closing date 6 months to allow for: (i) full implementation\n            without compromising quality of activities; (ii)\n            implementation of actions to address specific needs of\n            indigenous people (IPs) and revision of the project\n            implementation manual; (iii) reallocation of resources to\n            activities needing additional funds and to ensure\n            utilization of the remaining credit. The fourth\n            restructuring (level 2) was to extend the closing date by\n            another 6 months to enable: (i) final completion of project\n            activities at an advanced stage, delayed when the government\n            introduced changes in the financial system in keeping with\n            the new constitution that resulted in substantial delays in\n            getting funds to the project; (ii) reallocation of funds to\n            enable full utilization of the remaining credit. Several\n            lessons were learned from this project including the\n            following: (1) realistic independent assessment of project\n            progress is an effective mechanism that improves project\n            management and service delivery, (2) using independent\n            fiduciary and monitoring agents helps to identify problems\n            of inappropriate use of disbursed funds early on, (3) when\n            grassroots communities are facing crisis, it is possible to\n            turn the crises into opportunities for improving lives in\n            the community, and (4) streamlining institutional\n            arrangements and roles during project design, and providing\n            needed training to fulfill roles is a necessity for avoiding\n            implementation delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Total War Against HIV and AIDS\n            (TOWA) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Total War Against HIV and\n

The project\n            implementation has recently slowed down due to funds flow\n            problems. Consequently, the project is unlikely to disburse\n            funds to Central Statistics Organization (CSO) selected\n            under the last round of call for proposals.  An extension\n            will allow full implementation of activities by these CSOs\n            which have already been contracted to complete their tasks\n            without compromising on quality.   The extension will also\n            allow the project to implement actions to address specific\n            needs of Indigenous People based on the recently completed\n            consultations. The project grant manual will be revised to\n            address the needs of Indigenous People as the normal call\n            for proposal is unlikely to meet the needs of this special\n            group. Further, this will also allow the project to complete\n            the Impact evaluation being undertaken with technical\n            assistance from the Bank which was delayed due to longer\n            than originally envisaged time taken for contracting the\n            survey firms.

The project\n            implementation has recently slowed down due to funds flow\n            problems. Consequently, the project is unlikely to disburse\n            funds to Central Statistics Organization (CSO) selected\n            under the last round of call for proposals.  An extension\n            will allow full implementation of activities by these CSOs\n            which have already been contracted to complete their tasks\n            without compromising on quality.   The extension will also\n            allow the project to implement actions to address specific\n            needs of Indigenous People based on the recently completed\n            consultations. The project grant manual will be revised to\n            address the needs of Indigenous People as the normal call\n            for proposal is unlikely to meet the needs of this special\n            group. Further, this will also allow the project to complete\n            the Impact evaluation being undertaken with technical\n            assistance from the Bank which was delayed due to longer\n            than originally envisaged time taken for contracting the\n            survey firms.
