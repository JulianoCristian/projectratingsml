Some lessons\n            learned includes: consensus with regard to the content of\n            project activities is critical to ensuring ownership and\n            successful implementation. The project included activities\n            for which there was no consensus among stakeholders. As a\n            result some activities lacked the requisite ownership for\n            efficient implementation. The objective was not achieved.\n            Restructuring should initiate as early as possible during\n            project implementation to maximize its impact. Following the\n            lifting of the suspension of project disbursement,\n            recommendations from the task team to restructure the\n            project were accepted both by government and International\n            Development Association (IDA) management. Project\n            supervision requires close oversight, and active\n            decision-making from management in light of early warning\n            signs. Failures in project implementation were compounded by\n            a lack of adequate supervisory oversight and management\n            inaction when the situation warranted bold action. The\n            capacity of implementing entities needs to be thoroughly\n            assessed prior to project approval or effectiveness. Project\n            implementation was significantly affected by the lack of\n            technical leadership on the part of beneficiaries, who were\n            intended to implement their own activities. Adequate\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework and impact\n            evaluation mechanisms should be institutionalized at project\n            inception. Project implementation and the ability to monitor\n            and measure achievements were negatively affected by the\n            lack of an appropriate M&E framework, and the absence of\n            impact evaluation mechanism. Steering committee composition\n            should be balanced and inclusive, and benefit from high\n            level representatives able to influence and/or accelerate\n            decision-making. In the early stage of project\n            implementation the steering committee was insufficiently\n            involved in project implementation and failed to ensure\n            adherence to credit agreement requirements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Private Investment Promotion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Private Investment\n            Promotion

the\n            approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the changes\n            outlined in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), and\n            extension of the closing date from August 31, 2010 to\n            December 31, 2011. This restructuring is a level one\n            restructuring due to changes in the development objective\n            and in all of the project's four components which are\n            being refocused to meet the revised development objective.\n            The major modifications being are as follows: 1) increase\n            the importance of component one. Improving the investment\n            climate while focusing it on the most needed reform areas in\n            light of changes noted since the project's\n            effectiveness and the increased government clarity and\n            commitment to investment climate reform; 2) re-launch the\n            matching grant subcomponent of component two. Facilitating\n            private participation and enhancing competitiveness, so that\n            it operates, as originally envisaged, and fully complements\n            the investment promotion facilitation that has been\n            supported under the project and contributes meaningfully to\n            skills development in small and medium enterprises; 3) focus\n            the activities financed under the project component three.\n            Stimulating sector investment and implementing policy\n            reforms - by terminating project's assistance to the\n            following sub-components which have been completed or will\n            not be completed in light of an absence of consensus: (a)\n            telecommunication reform and development of information\n            technology sector; (b) postal reforms; and (c) edible oil\n            sector reform; 4) revise project development objective and\n            restructure, simplify, and update the results framework to\n            target and better measure the outcomes delivered by each\n            component and subcomponent; 5) extend the closing date so as\n            to enable sufficient time for implementation; and 6)\n            reallocate funds across the project categories to accomplish\n            the proposed changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -

The project will support these\n            initiatives through interrelated actions aimed at\n            stimulating private investment, and consist of four mutually\n            reinforced components: 1) improving the investment\n            environment by facilitating the policy, legal and regulatory\n            interface between the public and private sectors; 2)\n            facilitating private participation and enhancing\n            competitiveness; 3) stimulating sector investment and\n            implementing policy reforms; and 4) supporting\n            implementation and capacity building.
