Despite\n            unprecedented economic growth, India faces a big challenge\n            in fighting poverty. Educational opportunities and access\n            were uneven at best and marked by wide regional disparities.\n            In 2000, around 39 million children under the age group of 6\n            to 14 were not being schooled. In 2002, the International\n            Development Association financed Elementary Education\n            Project named Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), to enroll all 6\n            to 14-year-olds in school by 2010. Since 2001, the SSA has\n            supported government efforts to bring 20 million\n            out-of-school children into elementary education. It\n            includes learners from long -deprived communities and\n            minority communities, and children with special needs.\n            Universal access was almost achieved, with more than 98\n            percent of children having a primary school within one\n            kilometer of home and many states almost approaching\n            universal primary enrollment. A paradigm shift in teaching\n            methods was pioneered in Tamil Nadu. In just two years, the\n            activity-based learning method was scaled up across the\n            schools. Several states were adapting the innovations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Making elementary education universal"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Making elementary\n            education universal"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2009/09/25480071/india-making-elementary-education-universal","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"primary schools, learners, employment,\n            educational facilities, dropout rates, economic growth,\n            school facilities, its, out-of- school children, elementary\n            education, schools, enrollment, learning outcomes, school\n            enrollment, special needs, groups, universal access, school\n            graduates, educational quality, alternative education,\n            primary school facilities, school children, teaching\n            materials, educational projects, development goals,\n            elementary school, teacher, children with special needs,\n            primary school graduates, knowledge, education programs,\n            children, education departments, quality education, teacher\n            recruitment, education, gender gap, statistics, training,\n            primary enrollment, enrollment of children, secondary\n            schools, teacher effectiveness, educational opportunities,\n            facilities, teaching methods, girls, public school, access\n            to primary education, direct grants, primary education,\n            school buildings, learning, graduates, research, goals,\n            primary school, classrooms, universal primary enrollment,\n            school, teaching, school levels, grants, out-of-school children"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"IN-India:  Elementary Education (Sarva\n            Shiksha Abhiyan II) -- P102547,IN-Elementary Education Project -- P055459","topic":"Education for All m1327049 1467,Economics of Education m1327511 1540,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,Education m1327048 470,Levels of Education m1326138 478","subtopic":"Gender and Education,Education For All,Primary Education,Effective Schools and Teachers,Tertiary Education","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Gender,Education","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0831ee4d0_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","theme":"Decentralization,Gender,Participation and civic engagement,Education for all","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Gender,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Education for All m1327049 1467,Economics of Education m1327511 1540,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,Education m1327048 470,Levels of Education m1326138 478","owner":"EDU GP SAR (GED06)","trustfund":"TF026950-NATIONAL FORESTRY DEVELOP.\n            & CONSERV.,TF026362-PHRD-STATE/DISTRICT ELEMENTARY\n            EDUCATION PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"94587"},"9685111":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/04/9685111/india-elementary-education-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/04/9685111/india-elementary-education-project","new_url":"2008/04/9685111/india-elementary-education-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/07/18/000333038_20080718032445/Rendered/INDEX/ICR1930P0554590Box327409B01PUBLIC1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/07/18/000333038_20080718032445/Rendered/PDF/ICR1930P0554590Box327409B01PUBLIC1.pdf","credit_no":"3882","datestored":"2008-07-18T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2008-04-24T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - Elementary Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Elementary Education\n            Project for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: Flexibility to support differentiated\n            needs is central to addressing the challenges in diverse\n            local contexts. A norms-based approach to planning and\n            resource allocation has been well suited to the need to\n            achieve equitable access particularly in rural and\n            underserved areas. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)\n            experience increased the recognition of the need for a\n            differentiated approach to respond flexibly to the special\n            needs of diverse states and districts which themselves\n            differ over time, and to combine this flexibility with\n            accountability for agreed targets. In the special focus\n            districts (SFDs), the annual work plan and budget (AWBP)\n            process prioritizes access and equity; at the same time, SSA\n            supports quality enhancement measures identified by states.\n            Partnerships with local body and private aided schools are\n            encouraged under SSA while the growth of the unaided private\n            sector in urban areas suggests potential gains from\n            carefully designed partnerships with this sector as well.\n            The significant contribution of the unaided private sector\n            to the growth in enrollments particularly in urban areas,\n            suggests that innovative partnerships with un-aided private\n            schools can be explored to further scale up the achievement\n            of program outcomes. The SSA framework encourages\n            public-private partnerships, and the program is extended to\n            local body and private aided schools, but is less well\n            developed on partnerships with private unaided institutions,\n            to a large extent reflecting the lack of consensus either\n            nationally or in some states on how to move forward."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Elementary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Elementary Education

Between 1992/93\n            and 1998/99, net enrollment of the group of children aged\n            six to eight years increased from 68 percent to 82 percent\n            across the country. In rural areas, the net enrollment of\n            girls jumped from 55 percent to 76 percent, while that of\n            children as a whole increased from 72 percent to 84 percent.\n            Despite theseachievements, about 39 million children, or\n            about 21 percent of the group of six to 14 years, were the\n            school completion rate and the 5th grade was below the 78\n            percent national levelin 1999 and 2000.

This report identifies probable\n            environmental issues and impacts and comprises various\n            manuals, documents, and guidelines that have been\n            disseminated to the states to address such issues. The\n            salient theme is: community participation in planning and\n            construction ensures that implementation is free from\n            potential environmental hazards. Site selection will\n            consider the location's vulnerability to natural\n            hazards (flooding, cyclone, earthquakes); ensure buildings\n            are designed according to code, for disaster prevention;\n            prefabricated school structures will be dismantled and\n            shifted to new location to avoid flooding; and some schools\n            are designed to double up as shelters. Facility related\n            impacts include locating water facility to avoid\n            waterlogging, reusing wastewater to flush toilets or water\n            plants; rain water harvesting; using toilets designed on the\n            twin pit system; and alternatively, using septic tanks only\n            where the water table is very low and there is a\n            contamination risk. Encourage hedges and green fencing as\n            environmentally-friendly options for school boundaries.\n            Address basic site management  issues such as reducing\n            wastage, ensuring safety, avoiding damage to flora and\n            fauna, restricting air and noise pollution, and work\n            scheduling.
