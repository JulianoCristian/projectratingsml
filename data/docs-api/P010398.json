On the other hand,\n            the government's performance was weak, due to premature\n            methodology extension in the pilot area, overlaying the\n            project with a broad rural development approach , and, a\n            weak administration. The key lessons learned from this\n            project show that: 1) currently, the public sector extension\n            system results in a meager response to farmers' needs,\n            thus, attempts should be made for the private sector and\n            Non-governmental Organizations, to provide useful extension\n            services; 2) the Government needs to ensure a consistent and\n            long-term agricultural policy as a pre-requisite for\n            extension projects to become successful; 3) a single\n            extension methodology is hardly successful in a country with\n            substantial diversity in farming systems, hence, various\n            factors, such as climate, access to resources, education and\n            commercial aspirations, require consideration for a\n            successful extension program; and, 4) the community\n            acceptance and feasibility of new extension methods, should\n            be considered prior to implementation of such methods,\n            particularly where technological change at the farm level is scarce."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
