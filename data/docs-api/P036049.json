The main lessons learned with\n            implementation of the Project are the following: a strong\n            community pre-conditioning program is required to ensure\n            ownership and sustainability of the project's\n            activities; locally recruited teachers improve potential for\n            sustainability; ECD interventions that are targeted for the\n            poorest children show the highest benefits; The integration\n            of education, nutrition and health, and parental education\n            is more effectively achieved at the village/program level\n            (than at the district, provincial or national levels); the\n            use of block grants at the community level requires\n            \"preconditioning\" within those communities to\n            maximize the impact of the grants; a unified management\n            approach is likely to lead to a better result in the\n            implementation of ECD programs; projects should allocate\n            sufficient time within all fellowship programs to allow for\n            full completion of degree programs; delays in the provision\n            of counterpart funds directly affect the overall quality of\n            project implementation;
