Some\n            lessons learned included:  the experience of the Zambia\n            Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TEVET)\n            Development Program (TDP) exemplifies the challenges in\n            shifting the TVET system from supply- to demand-driven\n            provision of training in a country with little experience in\n            public-private partnerships and a large informal sector.  As\n            in many African countries and in other parts of the world,\n            Zambia's traditional TVET system comprised a network of\n            centrally funded and managed institutions, staffed by civil\n            servants, taking sixteen to eighteen-year olds straight from\n            school into full-time (mostly boarding) vocational courses\n            of one or three years.  In this context, the TDP represented\n            a brave and ambitious attempt to transform the system\n            through a particularly comprehensive package of reforms:\n            granting financial and managerial autonomy to publicly-owned\n            training institutions; establishing an autonomous national\n            training authority; and financing TVET through a competitive\n            training fund. Where it appears to have fallen down is\n            through taking on too much too quickly with insufficient\n            resources or analysis of the political economy challenges."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia -

Some lessons learned included: the\n            implementation or sustainability of a project may be\n            jeopardized when key actions are triggered by legislation\n            that needs to be approved at the highest levels of\n            Government. In order to guarantee success, the need for new\n            legislation should be carefully assessed or secured prior to\n            project approval. Experience from other countries and\n            regions have already shown that private sector taxation to\n            support the TEVET system is unlikely to be supported unless\n            the country has an established, diversified private sector.\n            Also, in countries where accountability systems are weak,\n            the private sector may be reluctant to agree on increased\n            taxation levels to support skills development. The\n            involvement of key stakeholders (association of training\n            providers, trade associations, and industry) from the early\n            stage of policy discussions is to build
