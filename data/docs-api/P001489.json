The Bank played a\n            positive role in the preparation of the project. On the\n            water supply side, the project was successful in addressing\n            deficiencies in water availability, tariff policy and\n            financial management. On the drainage and sanitation side\n            the bad performance of the local consulting firms recruited,\n            associated with the complexity of the Malagasy procurement\n            procedures, jeopardized the entire component which was\n            cancelled except for some urgent works. Nevertheless, the\n            drainage and sanitation works will be reactivated, combined\n            with flood control, under the Antananarivo Plain Development\n            Project. The review of the existing studies, carried out for\n            its preparation, led to major revisions and better\n            coordination between the various components of the project.\n            Concerning the Fivondronana, its deficiencies on the\n            financial and technical sides are being addressed under the\n            First Urban Project. The main lessons to be learned are the\n            necessity to have the final design available at appraisal,\n            as it is done now, and not to accept the recruitment of\n            local

     Antananarivo urban population and to improve sanitation\n            conditions in the city area, thereby reducing health hazards\n            to assist the beneficiary institutions to renew and\n            modernize their facilities, improve the reliability and\n            efficiency of their services and operations and strengthen\n            their financial management. The project components are: (a)\n            construction of water production works and transmission\n            mains; extension and reinforcement of the water distribution\n            system (reservoirs, pipes, booster station) and supply of\n            heavy maintenance equipment; (b) construction of drainage\n            collectors, a pumping station, river dikes, 10 storage\n            basins and canals and dredging of an existing canal; (c)\n            construction of a sewerage collecting system, a pumping\n            station, pumping discharge mains and pilot stabilization\n            ponds; (d) construction of collective dumping containers;\n            purchase of collection trucks and maintenance equipment and\n            upgrading of an experimental composting
