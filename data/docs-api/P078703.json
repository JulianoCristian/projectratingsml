This\n            led to a shift from PRSCs to a Development Policy Operation\n            (DPO) series that would be timed to match the speed of the\n            Government's implementation performance, focused on a\n            narrower reform agenda and accompanied by enhanced technical\n            assistance.The Poverty Reduction and Public Management\n            Operation (PRPMO) built on the achievements of the First\n            PRSC and supported reforms to strengthen public management\n            systems to increase the efficiency of public resource use\n            and to enhance capacity for poverty monitoring. In addition,\n            the operation supported actions to provide an adequate legal\n            and regulatory framework to ensure environmentally\n            sustainable development. The PRPMO supports the\n            Government's efforts to implement critical reforms in\n            public sector management and poverty reduction programs\n            identified in Guyana's 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            Paper (PRSP) and the 2004 and 2005 Progress Reports.The\n            Government's agenda laid out in the PRSP gives priority\n            to reforms aimed at improving the quality, transparency and\n            accountability of public resource management. The PRPMO\n            supported the preparation of a new forests bill, expected to\n            ensure the sustainable development of Guyana's forest\n            resources, while protecting the environment and advancing\n            land tenure and the rights of indigenous peoples."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Poverty Reduction and Public\n            Management Operation
