Some lessons learned included:\n            project design for post-conflict reconstruction should be\n            kept simple and oriented towards the immediate and urgent\n            reconstruction needs. Projects in post-conflict environments\n            must either include higher contingency costs than is normal\n            or set aside about 20% of the funds as unallocated funds, as\n            post-conflict environments are uncertain and volatile.\n            Capacity constraints in both the public sector and the\n            private sector in post-conflict environments are\n            considerable. Bank support delivered as emergency operations\n            within in a compressed time schedule usually will not allow\n            time for effective capacity building activities to be\n            delivered before projects are effective. The presence of a\n            field-based task-team leader (TTL) is of utmost importance\n            in contexts such as Afghanistan. In conflict countries with\n            significant capacity constraints, the presence of\n            country-based TTL to provide intensive implementation\n            support is crucial for timely achievement of project results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Kabul Urban\n            Reconstruction

Kabul Municipality\n            (KM). The changes address challenges resulting from\n            unrealistic project development objectives and complex\n            project design, which were the result of an attempt to\n            combine emergency response to improve delivery of basic\n            urban services in KM with long term capacity development\n            goals in a difficult country and sector environment. Changes\n            are also required to address significant cost overruns and a\n            subsequent funding gap.

The benefits\n            flowing from the project will be measured both in terms of\n            improved services in selected neighborhoods in Kabul and\n            enhanced managerial capacity of the executing agencies. In\n            Kabul upwards of 250,000 people will have access to basic\n            urban services at a level not seen for 23 years. At the\n            institutional level, both MUDH and KM will benefit from\n            technical assistance and training designed to improve\n            capacity to undertake their mandatory tasks. Risks include:\n            1) a deterioration in the security situation and a possible\n            delay in the economic revitalization of  the country; 2)\n            lack of  implementation capacity caused by many government\n            staff having left or having not been exposed to modem\n            technological developments; 3) logistical constraints\n            including unreliable transportation, lack of accommodation\n            and poor communications coupled with the security situation;\n            and 4) potential tension between ethnic groups. The first\n            risk is outside the scope of the project to control. The\n            second and third risks are manageable with close\n            supervision. The fourth risk will be mitigated through the\n            unbiased selection of upgrading areas. The Credit is\n            expected to be fully disbursed over a 48-month period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan
