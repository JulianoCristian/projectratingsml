Lessons learned\n            from the projects included: land tenure security and\n            farmers' freedom to make their own management decisions\n            are vital for successful farm privatization. In the case of\n            Tajikistan, strong support from the highest levels of\n            government was not enough to restructure and privatize state\n            and collective farms throughout the country. In\n            cotton-growing areas, local governments were more interested\n            in profiting from cotton production than sharing benefits\n            with newly independent farmers. International experience may\n            enrich project design, but only when local conditions are\n            fully taken into account. In the case of Tajikistan, project\n            design was overly ambitious and not tailored enough to the\n            local circumstances, including five years of civil war and\n            the remaining aspects of a command economy. Care must be\n            taken to identify all the factors constraining the\n            achievement of project objectives, and then something needs\n            to be done about each one of them. While some of the\n            barriers to farm restructuring (such as improving access to\n            water and credit), were dealt with at appraisal, the lack of\n            farm machinery was not recognized as in issue, even though\n            it was a high priority for farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Farm Privatization Support

has a modest institutional development\n            impact. The performances of both the Bank and the Borrower\n            are satisfactory. The lessons cited concerned: using a\n            dedicated project management unit; the need for active\n            intervention by Ministers and high level officials to push\n            through changes that were unpopular at the lower echelons of\n            Government; establishing credit facilities even though the\n            legal and regulatory had not yet sufficiently evolved; the\n            demonstration value of the land registration component; and\n            difficulties in adapting former soviet administrative\n            structures to serve private clients at the grass Roots. In\n            regard to the latter, the weakest aspect of the project has\n            been the inability to institutionalize more effectively the\n            delivery of farm information services. That is mostly due to\n            the fact that the current structure of the agricultural\n            ministry is on the one hand under-funded to effectively\n            fulfill its mandate and, not suited for the delivery of farm\n            information to the grassroots. The Government needs to\n            revisit its agricultural policy and the institutional\n            instruments through which it will develop the sector. Its\n            institutions should be reorganized to better be able to\n            serve the emerging private sector, and shift from a command\n            and control structure focusing on production targets to a\n            regulatory and policy body which lays the proper incentives\n            to foster the development of the agricultural sector. Such a\n            structure would concentrate more efforts on its ability to\n            deliver information and guidance to the producer at the\n            grassroots and involve consultation with the private sector\n            in forming policies and guidelines."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan -

The project consists of four\n            components: 1) Farm restructuring services will support the\n            development of procedures and institutional mechanisms at\n            the state and selected regions to ensure fair and equitable\n            transfer of land and other farm assets to private individual\n            or groups; and to create sustainable family farms. 2)\n            Irrigation and drainage works will support efforts to repair\n            and replace such facilities in the selected farms so as to\n            create and sustain privatized agriculture at the farm\n            levels; to assist in the establishment of water users'\n            associations; and to establish performance monitoring and\n            evaluation of irrigation water use. 3) Provision of on-time\n            implementation units will support a) a one-time grant to the\n            private family farms by providing a minimal amount of the\n            most critical agricultural inputs to increase crop and or\n            animal productivity; and b) creation of pilot rural savings\n            and credit associations that will meet its members'\n            short
