Some lessons learned included: emergency\n            projects should be kept 'simple' in design and be\n            limited to critical activities, keeping in mind the\n            emergency nature of intervention. This is especially true\n            for project development objective (PDO), which need to be\n            kept fully in line with project components. Similarly, a\n            strong monitoring and evaluation framework needs to be\n            developed so that the Bank team has a clear mechanism to\n            follow up on progress. The Bank needs to fully utilize\n            critical junctures at project supervision, including the use\n            the Mid-term review and project restructuring as an\n            opportunity to take a critical look at project\n            implementation as well as objectives. There is clearly a\n            need for consistency of leadership from the Bank side to\n            prevent frequent Task Team Leader (TTL) hand-over, and to\n            make sure that courageous decisions are made at critical\n            times. At the same time, it is apparent that the Bank team\n            was under a lot of pressure not to cancel the project\n            despite financial management and other shortcomings. This\n            will have been a good time for the Country Management Unit\n            to step in to support closing of the project. Chronic\n            underfunding of a sector or a Ministry leads to weak\n            capacity to implement any activity when an emergency occurs,\n            as well as to insufficient project ownership. Further,\n            building capacity in Veterinary Services and enhancing their\n            Governance in developing/transition countries should become\n            a priority as their current weakness poses a threat to the\n            economies and to public health. Projects of this nature\n            generally take an average of five years to achieve results.\n            Considering that the implementation agencies had no prior\n            experience with Bank projects, a period longer than two\n            years to implement should have been ensured."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Avian and Human Influenza Control\n            and Prevention
