The\n            program offers insight into a number of important design and\n            implementation issues with implications for other projects:\n            Amongst the key lessons regarding SWAps, these lessons were\n            cited: 1) SWAps can be gradually adopted, yielding\n            increasing improvements in sector management even when the\n            change is incomplete. 2) Mechanisms to facilitate\n            implementation when the government has insufficient capacity\n            or deficiencies yield good results and allow the government\n            to gradually take on the responsibility. 3) Establish\n            performance indicators and progress benchmarks for\n            establishing the SWAps.    SWAps need to clearly define the\n            scope of the \"sector\" to be managed so that key\n            sector stakeholders are reached by program interventions and\n            donors. Parallel funding should be discouraged. 5) Donor\n            coordination requires negotiating skills, leadership, and\n            presence in the field. A Code of Conduct with clear rules of\n            engagement for coordinating and managing SWAps needs to be\n            defined upfront, to ensure decisions are taken swiftly and\n            program focus is maintained. Some lessons about managing\n            institutional development included: 1) Not carrying out an\n            analysis of the political economy of reforms can lead to\n            failure. identify opposition whether within the health\n            ministry, physician's associations, other worker's\n            associations, or users of the services themselves. 2)\n            Identify incentives for stakeholders to bolster\n            institutional change. General lessons included: Take into\n            account those too poor to consume government services;\n            icharging them informal fees is too costly. Participatory\n            preparation, while enhancing ownership, can dilute the focus\n            of a project's design; strike a balance to ensure both\n            goals are met.  Measure not just long-term outcomes but also\n            intermediate indicators that would lead to those outcomes in\n            order to ensure program effects can be measured. Set targets\n            related to the capacity of the implementing entity. A risk\n            management strategy must be an essential part of annual\n            program reviews and routine project supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Health and Population Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Health and\n            Population Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6537940/bangladesh-health-population-program-project","projn":"BD-Health And Population Program Project -- P037857","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060117121046"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Health,General education sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to services, agricultural production,\n            Antenatal Care, basic services, child health services,\n            childbirth, clinics, communicable diseases, community\n            clinics, Competitive Bidding, cost-effectiveness,\n            decentralization, districts, economies of scale,\n            epidemiology, equipment, Expenditures, Family Planning,\n            financial management, gender, health care delivery, health\n            care utilization, health insurance, health insurance\n            schemes, Health Management, health needs, health outcomes,\n            Health Policy, health programs, Health Project, health\n            sector, health service, Health Services, health status,\n            hospitals, households, human resources management,\n            immunization, income countries, income groups, Infant\n            Mortality, Information System, Information Systems,\n            integration, low income, malnutrition, Medical Research,\n            Mortality, NGOs, Nutrition, Nutritional status, Occupational\n            Health, patient, Performance Indicators, Primary Health\n            Care, private sector, private services, provision of\n            services, public health, public health services, public\n            hospitals, public sector, rural areas, Rural Development,\n            safe water, School Health, Sexually Transmitted Diseases,\n            STDs, Supervision, Sustainability, urban areas, Vaccination, workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
