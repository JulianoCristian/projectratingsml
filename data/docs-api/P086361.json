Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) a stable macroeconomic and political\n            environment contributed greatly to the successful\n            implementation of difficult structural reforms in Vietnam;\n            2) overall, progress was slower in policy areas\n            characterized by limited political will, conflicting\n            institutional responsibilities or insufficient analytical\n            work; 3) an effective coordination mechanism is essential to\n            overcome the logistical challenges posed by a wide ranging\n            and cross-cutting policy dialogue; and 4) the Vietnam\n            experience demonstrates that poverty reduction support\n            credit programs, with very low conditionality, are a\n            well-suited aid

    Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy provides\n            further support to Vietnam' s reform program. It\n            supports: 1) Transition to a market economy. The present\n            operation promotes greater internal and external competition\n            and improves efficiency and resource allocation in the\n            economy. Policy actions under the credit help improve the\n            regulatory framework for private sector development, and\n            enhance transparency and accountability in State-owned\n            enterprise operations and in the banking sector. The credit\n            supports the initiation of fundamental changes in the\n            financial sector, designed to transform the State bank of\n            Vietnam into a modern central bank, to strengthen the\n            commercial orientation of State-owned commercial banks, and\n            to develop capital markets. 2) Inclusive and sustainable\n            development. The proposed credit also promotes human\n            development through upgrading the quality of education\n            (especially in poor zones), promoting inclusive education\n            for children with disabilities, improving the access of the\n            poor to health services, and helping secure asset ownership\n            through the implementation of the new Land Law. The proposed\n            credit also encourages important policy measures leading to\n            more sustainable management of natural resources, including\n            through strategic environmental assessments. 3) Building\n            modern governance. The credit supports actions to implement\n            the government' s public financial management reform\n            agenda. More effective public resource allocation is\n            achieved through better coordination plans and budgets and\n            through the adoption of Medium- Term Expenditure Frameworks\n            (MTEFs). New budget allocation norms increase the coherence\n            between capital and recurrent expenditures. An\n            anti-corruption law targets greater accountability in public\n            finance and public administration. The credit also supports\n            the ambitious agenda of the legal system development strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Fifth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operation
