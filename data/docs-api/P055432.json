The\n            main lessons from these credits suggest: 1) Upon the need to\n            drastically reduce the scope of a quick-disbursement\n            operation, given practical and political difficulties, this\n            should provide the opportunity for an operation\n            reassessment, in particular the credit amount, to ensure\n            that a relationship remain between that amount and the\n            policy adjustments being supported. 2) Providing general\n            budget support under circumstances where there is virtually\n            no auditing of, or accountability for government\n            expenditures, is unwise, particularly in the absence of a\n            strong, monitorable agreement with the borrower on the use\n            of those funds. 3) Providing budget support, in light of\n            major tax evasion and excessive government expenditures, can\n            be potentially counter-productive, in the absence of an\n            agreed, concerted direct attack on those elements. The\n            presence of budget support reduces the natural pressure on\n            governments to take urgent and meaningful action. 4) In a\n            situation where there is no clear borrower commitment to a\n            course of action, or there is a history of back-tracking or\n            non-implementation of laws and regulations, the mere passage\n            of legislation is not usually a good basis for tranche\n            release conditionality. There also needs to be a period of\n            implementation or, better still, conditionality based on\n            actual results achieved. Given a long, complicated reform\n            agenda, careful sequencing of operations is required. This\n            was the case for PFSAC and PFSAC2, to be followed by the\n            proposed Economic Management SAC; and for SOSAC, to be\n            followed by the proposed SOSAC2, examples of good practice.\n            In contrast, there was no immediate follow-up to TAC,\n            compounding its poor design as a one-tranche operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

Second Public\n            Finance Structural Adjustment  Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is rated satisfactory\n            and project sustainability is rated as likely. The\n            performance of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. There were several lessons from\n            implementing this project. 1) In a post-conflict environment\n            of weak governance and still festering ethnic tensions, a\n            firm commitment by the top State and entity leaderships to\n            the reform program and associated policy measures is vital\n            to success. Moreover, the dedication of a core team of\n            political and technical leadership amidst elections and\n            changing ministerial cabinets greatly assisted in keeping\n            reforms on track. 2) Inter-entity and ethnic cooperation\n            requires a careful, often slow, process of consensus\n            building, realization of \"win-win\" solutions, and\n            is facilitated by external mediation. Technical working\n            groups supported by Bank teams or other donor teams and\n            external political or financial incentives from the OHR and\n            donors are critical to achieve agreement on reforms. 3) A\n            clear vision and a clear supporting strategy for public\n            finance reforms was important to success. The project\n            followed logically from the first Public Finance Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project PFSAC-I (report no. P7208),\n            represented continuity, and is to be followed by another\n            adjustment credit. Careful linkages of reforms and their\n            sequencing is critical, especially when different actors\n            that are required to coordinate (State, entities,\n            sub-entities) are involved. 4) TA has to be planned and\n            linked to project implementation from the project design\n            stage where local capacity is so weak. 5) All this, in turn,\n            requires careful spadework, reform blueprint, technical\n            studies. Bank work and TA was of importance. It requires\n            deep institutional knowledge and experience of the country\n            or region and of post-conflict conditions. The skilled Bank\n            team and the continuity of its composition won credibility\n            and led to success. 6) In the weak governance environment\n            and with politically sensitive reforms, intensive\n            supervision is vital. Supervision has to be pro-active and\n            fully engaged at the political and working levels and\n            directed at finding solutions. Resident mission played an\n            important supporting role. Partnerships with the Fund and\n            with bilateral donors has leveraged up the impact of all\n            parties, with each playing a lead role in a specialized\n            field. 7) The passing of legislation and the setting of\n            reform-supporting institutions, difficult though they are,\n            represent only the first step to final outcomes of higher\n            growth and greater efficiency in public finances. The\n            quality and steadfastness of implementation are vital\n            factors. The authorities and all their donor partners,\n            especially the Bank, will have to remain vigilant to the\n            sources of vulnerabilities in implementation and respond\n            promptly to emerging problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Second Public\n            Finance Structural Adjustment  Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and
