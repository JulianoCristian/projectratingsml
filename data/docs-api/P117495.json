The PRSF series has\n            provided important support to the Government to\n            operationalize its ambitious medium-term development\n            strategy i.e., the economic development and poverty\n            reduction strategy (EDPRS) by translating its objectives\n            into priority actions. The PRSF series provided substantial\n            financing to Rwanda's budget, including during the 2008\n            crisis. It was successful in fostering better donor\n            coordination, improved harmonization and reinforced support\n            for reforms among the country's budget support donors:\n            the World Bank, African Development Bank, and bilateral\n            donors -all partners in the Budget Support Harmonization\n            Group and part of the semi-annual joint budget support\n            reviews (JBSR). PRSF series focused on capacity building,\n            including sub-national levels of government in planning. The\n            success of the PRSF series was also largely helped by its\n            ability to base its design on strong sector dialogue. This\n            has helped to: (i) ensure the PRSF reflects substantive\n            policy agreements reached at the sector level; (ii)\n            strengthen the capacity of sector ministries to present\n            their needs and priorities during national level policy\n            discussions and budget negotiations; and (iii) facilitate\n            coordination of the Bank's inputs into the common\n            performance assessment framework (CPAF) policy discussions\n            in a timely manner. Considering the preparation and\n            implementation of the series coincided with the CPAF\n            establishment in 2008, this period can be regarded as a\n            transition or learning period for all parties involved in\n            budget support in Rwanda. Also, growing mutual understanding\n            of what each partner would need to get out of the process\n            helped it to become smoother over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Rwanda -

           strategic outcomes of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)\n            by focusing support on two Economic Development and Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) flagship programs: growth for\n            jobs and exports, and governance. It adopts policies and\n            reforms that support more efficient governance and\n            contribute to broad based growth by easing the key\n            constraints posed by low agriculture productivity, low\n            skills base, and the high cost of infrastructure services in\n            Rwanda. The operation complements the sector budget support,\n            Community Living Standards Credit (CLSC), to support\n            continued reforms in health and the implementation of the\n            Vision Umurenge Program (VUP). Supported policies draw on\n            the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF) for\n            monitoring the EDPRS, to reduce the transaction costs of\n            Government reporting to donors on the use of aid funds. This\n            program continues to support the Government of Rwanda as it\n            implements measures to foster broad based growth in the\n            context of enhanced decentralization reforms. Donor support\n            to the Rwanda budget, based on policy reforms and outcome\n            indicators of the CPAF, are the reflection of a mature\n            partnership between international partners and Rwanda.\n            Rwanda's performance is impressive when looking at the\n            number of EDPRS indicator targets which have been met\n            already, as well as the number of policy actions which have\n            been implemented since 2008. In 2010 Rwanda continued its\n            strong reform performance, despite the impact of the recent\n            global economic slowdown."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Seventh Poverty Reduction
