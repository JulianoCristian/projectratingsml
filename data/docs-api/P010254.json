The\n            project achieved its main objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, one of the key factors that\n            affects the sustainability of an intermediation operation is\n            the financial viability and sustainability of the credit\n            institutions, which is also affected by their internal\n            operational efficiency as well as the policy and regulatory\n            framework in which they operate. Satisfactory loan\n            collection performance reflects the internal operational\n            efficiency of DFIs and is a major indicator of program\n            sustainability. Second, effective monitoring and supervision\n            of the project by both IDA and the Government was integral\n            to the success of the project.
