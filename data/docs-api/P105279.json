Some lessons learned included: proper\n            sequencing of sector policy dialogue and investment support\n            is important for success when the two are closely connected.\n            The Bank has an important role in ensuring that investment\n            decisions are made based on technical, financial, and\n            economic merits. Where a country's political timetable\n            is liable to bring significant shifts in policy, a keen\n            appreciation of political economy is necessary. The Bank has\n            much to gain from locating key operational staff in the\n            field, particularly where a continuous and intense dialogue\n            is required, such as Senegal's energy sector.\n            Inattention to the good practice principles for the\n            application of conditionality can result in policy-based\n            operations that are unbalanced and lack focus. In designing\n            policy-based operations, a realistic sense of the pace of\n            reform will take account of political economy considerations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -

Sector\n            Recovery Development Policy Credit is to ensure a sustained\n            and sound long term development of electricity services and\n            supply of petroleum products for Senegal. To achieve this\n            objective, the operation comprises: (a) financial support to\n            the Government to allow the power utility of Senegal -\n            Societe Nationale d Electricite (National Power Utility of\n            Senegal) (SENELEC) - to restore by end CY2009 its financial\n            equilibrium and to meet standard financial ratios and credit\n            worthiness; and (b) policy measures aimed at ensuring that\n            the electricity sub-sector and the downstream hydrocarbon\n            sub-sector develop and operate in an efficient and\n            transparent way with adequate governance. The main risk\n            under this operation is related to the rising and widely\n            fluctuating international energy prices particularly of\n            petroleum products, which create instability in domestic\n            energy costs and may induce the Government to suspend or\n            only partially implement the continued pass-through of cost\n            increases to consumers. This risk is mitigated by: (a) the\n            Government's commitment for reform and actions to\n            reduce costs, improve operational efficiency, invest in\n            efficient and least cost facilities and to diversify; and\n            (b) the existing regulations and price adjustment mechanisms\n            for electricity services as well as for petroleum products\n            allowing for monthly or quarterly adjustments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -
