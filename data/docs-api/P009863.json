Lessons learned from the\n            project are: 1) lack of staff mobility is still constraining\n            operations of field extension staff. Inadequate advantage\n            was taken by the state governments of finance and provide\n            policy support for the proposed personal loans scheme for\n            staff to purchase private vehicles for public use; 2) there\n            is a need to more fully exploit the use of cost effective\n            media materials (radio, television and video and printed\n            materials) and modern communication systems to enhance\n            dissemination of technical information); and 3) the\n            inclusion of a component to finance Special Sub-Projects\n            (SSPs) for the Government of India (GOI) to undertake\n            regular reviews and special studies, provided flexibility in\n            project design to allow the GOI to obtain a national\n            perspective on extension development in India.
