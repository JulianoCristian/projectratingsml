The key lessons convey that:\n            1) The Government's strong commitment to the reform of\n            the private pension system, ensured that the design,\n            negotiation, and implementation of reform, be done\n            collaboratively, with the necessary technical, and financial\n            support from the Bank, to achieve success. 2) Although a\n            strong government commitment for pension reform existed,\n            given the highly political nature of the National\n            Worker's Housing Fund Institute, the necessary reforms\n            proved difficult to achieve, because of its governance\n            structure. The issue needs to be pursued, if the overall\n            social security system is to be sustainable. 3) Given the\n            limited political capital for reform efforts, the Bank\n            should structure loan conditionality, requiring reform to be\n            implemented prior to disbursement. Thus, selection of the\n            single-tranche adjustment operation, proved valuable, since\n            its design provides this requirement, allows ample leverage\n            to the Bank, and, adjustment operations are protected from\n            significant political risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Second Contractual Savings\n            Development Program (CSDP 02)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Second Contractual\n            Savings Development Program (CSDP 02)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/12/728629/mexico-second-contractual-savings-development-program-csdp-02","projn":"MX-Contract.
