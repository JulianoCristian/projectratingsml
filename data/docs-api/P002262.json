The project was implemented in a very\n            difficult period in Rwanda and made an important\n            contribution to helping the country in its transition from\n            war to peace. Given the private business investments\n            financed under the line of credit component, the\n            institutional improvements implemented at the central bank\n            and the institutional and legal reform process started,\n            sustainability of the project is likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were rated satisfactory: The Bank\n            maintained the dialogue with the Borrower during the\n            difficult period after the war and helped significantly in\n            ensuring effectiveness of the project; and while there were\n            significant delays in all components of the project, the\n            Borrower carried out a large scope of activities in a\n            satisfactory way. These were some of the lessons learned:\n            Separate legal and regulatory reforms from technical\n            assistance. In the aftermath of a civil war, projects have\n            to be adjusted to the new circumstances and be focused on\n            priorities. A constituency for reform is crucial for\n            implementation. Capable implementing agencies are critical\n            for implementation. Instruments need to fit country\n            circumstances. Structural deficiencies in the financial\n            sector have to be addressed to guarantee long-term viability\n            of the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Private Sector Development

GDP\n            has declined since then due to low coffee prices and poor\n            weather. The objective of this project is to promote swift\n            growth of the Rwandan private sector. The private sector is\n            considered a key element in a strategy for growth and\n            diversification. The project will promote efforts to ensure\n            that the private sector has access to investment financing\n            and managerial and technical support. It will also support\n            efforts to improve the legal and regulatory environment and\n            enhance the investment and export incentives. The three\n            components of the project which will aid in achieving these\n            goals include: line of credit; private sector support fund;\n            and institutional strengthening. The Rwandan government\n            believes that growth led by the private sector can provide\n            employment and make a significant contribution to export\n            earnings. The project is a complement to Rwanda's\n            macroeconomic adjustment program already in place."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Private Sector Development
