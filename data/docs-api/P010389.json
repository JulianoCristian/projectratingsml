The project achieved\n            its objectives, its impact on institutional development has\n            been substantial, sustainability is likely, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            The main lesson that can be learned from this project is\n            that structural reforms can be successfully introduced in a\n            democratic society such as India, provided that such reforms\n            are cognizant of: 1) the need to undertake timely and\n            decisive actions to restore macroeconomic stability,\n            particularly to bring fiscal deficits under control; 2) the\n            importance of formulating and announcing such structural\n            changes in a time-bound manner to signal the\n            Government's commitment and provide an anchor for\n            private sector expectations; and 3) the imperative of\n            marshalling the political support and cooperation of various\n            interest groups, particularly organized labor, through\n            consultation and actions to alleviate transitional social costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Structural Adjustment
