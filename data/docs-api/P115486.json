Some\n            lessons learned included: the crisis and emergencies bank\n            instrument and procedures offered advantages to assist in\n            the Government's situation. The project was possible\n            because the GOA had pre-identified critical road links by\n            adopting a rural infrastructure strategy and action plan and\n            started its implementation as conditions of adjustment\n            credits, and availability of basic data and designs that\n            only needed to be updated. The Bank assigned a very\n            experienced project preparation team, mobilized\n            international experts quickly and provided extensive\n            supervision during implementation. Incremental improvements\n            were made during project implementation adjusted to the\n            current conditions (for example: move to more efficient\n            designs) because of the phased approvals. The project showed\n            that to obtain support from local communities where\n            possible, the designs should provide sidewalks in build-up\n            areas (roadside strip development) and villages to improve\n            access to public facilities and ensure pedestrian safety,\n            and the project should promote local employment on the\n            rehabilitation works. The use of cement concrete guardrails\n            (labor intensive construction method) was experimented\n            during the first year implementation of the project but this\n            method was not mainstreamed due to its negative effect on\n            snow removal activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Lifeline Roads Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia

revival. The road to Tatev monastery, a 9th century\n            monastery, is an architectural masterpiece, a landmark, and\n            a tourist attraction which winds through a spectacular gorge\n            with rocky slopes and lush forests. It once connected\n            several villages, but became so dilapidated that it was\n            known not as the most beautiful pass in Armenia, but as the\n            most dangerous one. The government, with World Bank support,\n            rebuilt new road to Tatev, which lures tourists from Armenia\n            and beyond once again, and benefits these isolated\n            communities. One of the main goals of the Tatev revival\n            project, which upgraded the road and other infrastructure\n            here, was to connect the area's heritage with\n            today's development. As a result, the Wings of Tatev,\n            the longest aerial tramway in the world, spanning the\n            Vorotan River Gorge, was built and is already a major\n            attraction for tourists. The roads linking villages to\n            highways are often called lifeline roads in Armenia, as they\n            are vital for communities, located dozens of kilometers away\n            from urban centers. The World Bank-supported project has\n            ended geographic and economic isolation of rural\n            communities. It has fixed almost 300 kilometers of roads in\n            over 80 communities in Armenia, and has created thousands of\n            short-term jobs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tatev's new road in Armenia leads to\n            economic revival"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tatev's new road in Armenia\n            leads to economic revival"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/01/25070622/tatevs-new-road-armenia-leads-economic-revival","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"houses, services, communities, community,\n            rural communities, road, villages, project, market, safety,\n            highways, shops, roads"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","topic":"Transport and Sustainable Development\n            m1327165 790,Road Transport m1327629 1801,Transport m1326661 135,Transport Infrastructure m1327632 1803,Transport and Logistics Services m1326915 793,Transport Governance m1327401 1823,Economic Growth m1326241 471","projn":"AM-Lifeline Roads Improvement Project - 2nd\n            Addl.
