The\n            Kolkheti National Park (KNP) and the Kobuleti State Nature\n            Reserve (KNR) illustrated a problem with setting-up and\n            operating consultative councils to the protected area\n            administrations, which is a generic issue for the national\n            network of protected areas. The Law of Georgia on the\n            Protected Areas System calls for having such councils in\n            place and this legal requirement is being concurred with by\n            formal establishment of the councils, but there is no\n            example of an effectively functioning council for any of the\n            protected areas. For biodiversity conservation projects it\n            is advisable to plan development of biodiversity/protected\n            area management plans as early in the project cycle as\n            possible. The timeframe necessary for the development of\n            management plans for Kolkheti protected areas under the\n            Georgia Integrated Coastal Management Project (GICM) project\n            had been dramatically underestimated, and later it turned\n            out not to be an exceptional case for projects being\n            implemented in Georgia. The lesson drawn from this\n            experience is that preparation of management plans will be\n            scheduled within a realistic timeframe and as early in the\n            project cycle as possible - preferably during project\n            preparation. For medium term perspective projects should not\n            focus on introduction of ambitious environmental\n            legislation, but rather on achieving good environmental\n            performance under the current legal framework. Provided the\n            assumption that the trend of de-regulation and market\n            liberalization continues in Georgia, projects would most\n            likely not succeed in fostering establishment of overarching\n            environmental legislation. Managing project implementation\n            in a politically dynamic country will imply regular scanning\n            of political trends and flexibility in adjusting to changing times."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Integrated Coastal Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Integrated Coastal\n            Management

In order to achieve an economic\n            development along the coastal areas, the project aims at\n            effectively integrate environmental planning and management,\n            through the development, test and evaluation of different\n            methods. To this end, the project includes five components.\n            First the establishment of an institutional and legal\n            framework, thus facilitating intersectoral planning and\n            participation. With the creation of agencies and other\n            groups, in addition to legislation drafting, this component\n            will support coastal management through training and mass\n            media awareness. Secondly, the protection and management of\n            forests and natural habitats will be supported for\n            biodiversity conservation. A third component is the\n            establishment of a coastal environment quality monitoring\n            and information system, setting standards along major point\n            sources of pollution. The fourth component addresses the\n            evaluation of coastal erosion, towards an integrated water\n            management. Finally, the development of a national oil spill\n            contingency plan and marine oil pollution control plan will\n            provide support towards a Regional Black Sea Strategy Action
