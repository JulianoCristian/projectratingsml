Project outcomes are\n            downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory from a satisfactory\n            rating on the three loans, and, on the institutional\n            development impact rating, it downgrades to modest the\n            Finance Companies Restructuring Loan; from substantial to\n            modest that of the Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan;\n            yet, concurs on a substantial institutional development\n            impacts for the Second Economic and Financial Adjustment\n            Loan. Finally, mixed reviews are also shown on the Bank and\n            Borrower performances. The main findings from the review of\n            these loans suggest: given that the significant cost of\n            cleansing financial crises can offset progress made over the\n            years in poverty alleviation, and other social improvements,\n            the Bank should continue to play a role in both improving\n            financial sector governance, and soundness to reduce the\n            probability of crisis, as well as in post-crisis management\n            and well-structured recovery. Early underestimates of the\n            severity of the crisis, and the impact of the closure of the\n            finance companies (FCs) on the economy, raised concerns\n            about the credibility of the international financial\n            institutions' approach, and, most important to\n            Thailand's future, about the financial reform itself.\n            This suggests that crises in other countries need to be\n            approached more comprehensively, taking into account\n            potential negative impacts of large scale closures. The\n            audit stipulates short-term crisis management policies can\n            compromise essential structural reforms. The failure to\n            factor in the design of the reforms the inadequacies of the\n            Thai legal, and regulatory infrastructure led to approaches\n            that may have increased the cost of cleanup. Further lessons\n            highlight that sequencing and timing of reforms are crucial;\n            and recommend that succeeding loans with increasingly\n            broader goals, and a growing list of conditions, diffused\n            the focus of reform and meaningful monitoring. A better\n            approach might have been a well-designed programmatic loan,\n            as now being used (but not available at that time), which\n            seeks to develop a set of priority reforms, and sequences\n            the steps for supporting those reforms through successive loans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand -

Main\n            lessons learned were: The capability of the Borrower to\n            understand, contribute to, and commit to a comprehensive\n            reform program is a prerequisite. The Bank should maintain,\n            or have access to, a capacity to more effectively track\n            developments in financial sectors of countries that are near\n            graduation, or have graduated; the crisis took the World\n            Bank by surprise because the Bank was not carrying out\n            economic and sector work in Thailand, and did not analyze\n            the underlying financial framework nor verify the accuracy\n            of financial information. A single tranche policy-based\n            operation--such as this project--with the bulk of policy\n            actions clearly laid out in a precise timetable prior to\n            Board approval, is a focused and flexible approach to\n            provide support for structural reforms in a rapidly changing\n            situation. It is important to a recovery operation with\n            multiple financiers to agree on the best course of action\n            which includes an appropriate division of responsibility. In\n            emergency situations, the Bank should relax labor-intensive\n            activities so that expertise may be freed for more\n            substantive analysis and creative solutions, and should\n            shorten the procurement process. Sustained technical\n            assistance is needed to implement loan conditions and to\n            supplement Bank staff resources, and to help establish\n            strong relationships with
