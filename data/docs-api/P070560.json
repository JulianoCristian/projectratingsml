Some lessons learned included: the experience\n            of PFPSAL provides a number of insights that speak to four\n            distinct issues: (i) the critical role of country\n            leadership; (ii) the importance of bundling knowledge and\n            lending in Banks operations; (iii) the appropriate balance\n            of the Bank's focus on supporting design and\n            implementation of a program; and (iv) the specifics of\n            programs in crisis situations. A High degree of up-front\n            political leadership, ownership of the strategy, and the\n            program by the key ministries in the government, and\n            consensus behind the program were important preconditions\n            for the successful adoption and implementation of reforms\n            especially in the case of public sector reforms. The link\n            between lack of public finance transparency and financial\n            sector vulnerability was key for the success of the program.\n            This underscores the usefulness of designing PFPSAL as a\n            multi-sector program. At the same time, as the experience\n            with the differing pace of implementation of the two\n            components under PFPSAL III shows, separation into different\n            programs may be called for at some point in time. In a\n            much-improved environment waiting for an appropriate timing\n            for the privatization of state banks has probably resulted\n            in greater revenues than anticipated or that will have been\n            achieved in faster sales. The increased interest in the\n            Turkish banking sector was most unexpected only two or three\n            years before partly because at the depth of the crisis it is\n            easy to underestimate the extent of the recovery. Therefore,\n            a broader conclusion could be that, On designing a program\n            in the midst of a crisis, flexibility is particularly\n            important regarding policy measures that may have widely\n            differing outcomes under different states of the economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Third Programmatic Financial and\n            Public Sector Adjustment Loan

the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that The lesson\n            learned indicated that a number of banks that had fallen\n            below the minimum Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) level were\n            re-capitalized from private sources. Vakif bank received a\n            subordinated loan from the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund\n            (SDIF) to meet the minimum CAR requirement. Presently only\n            two banks remain with SDIF (Bayindir and Pamuk). Liquidation\n            proceedings for Ticaret are continuing, although these have\n            been interrupted from time to time by legal actions taken by\n            the employee pension fund. Pamuk bank was re-offered for\n            sale as of April 2003 and SDIF is currently evaluating the\n            two active proposals. Bayindir's status as a bridge\n            bank and the timing of its eventual liquidation will be\n            reviewed at the appropriate time. The failure of Imar bank\n            in mid-2003 was a serious blow. The bank, owned by the\n            controversial Uzan Group, saw its license revoked by the\n            Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA) in July 2003.\n            A subsequent investigation found that the bank: (i) vastly\n            understated its deposits - a true total of US$5.5 billion in\n            contrast to the balance sheet figure of US$550 million; (ii)\n            had paid only a fraction of its with-holding tax\n            obligations; and (iii) had sold some US$500 million in\n            T-bills that it had never owned and was not licensed to\n            sell. The Government announced a payment plan for individual\n            depositors in November which will create a burden on the\n            Treasury totaling some 2.2 percent of GNP. Imar bank has not\n            been formally intervened by SDIF and therefore the blanket\n            guarantee for depositors and creditors has not been invoked.\n            Following completion of a review of the improvements\n            required in the legal framework for bankruptcy and\n            collateral foreclosure to facilitate resolution of\n            non-performing loans (NPLs)-meeting a second tranche\n            condition for Programmatif Financial Sector Adjustment Loan\n            - PFPSAL II, a series of amendments to the Execution and\n            Bankruptcy Act (EBA) were enacted in mid-2003. The\n            Government has prepared a second set of amendments to\n            introduce a pre-packaged bankruptcy option in the EBA and\n            these additional amendments are expected to be enacted by\n            early 2004."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Second Programmatic Financial and\n            Public Sector Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey -

aims at supporting\n            reforms in the public sector, in response primarily to the\n            financial crisis of February 2001, and, ensure as well\n            continued social programs through adequate funding. To this\n            end, the project will examine, and help the government amend\n            as needed the banking regulatory framework, including\n            strengthening of the new Bank Regulation and Supervision\n            Agency (BRSA), and, restructuring/privatization of state\n            banks. Regulation regarding banking failure resolution and\n            problem banks, will be institutionally strengthened, through\n            a process of aligning prudential banking systems, to reduce\n            banking vulnerability, withstand external shocks (thereby\n            reduce systemic failure risk), to position Turkey's\n            banking sector for accession to the European Union (EU), in\n            accordance with applicable EU banking sector directives.\n            Furthermore, structural fiscal adjustment policies will be\n            supported, to achieve macroeconomic stability, and ensure\n            the protection of public social spending. The\n            Government's public expenditure management reform\n            program will be broadened, which includes improvements to\n            budget planning, financial accountability, and public\n            liability management, as well as initial steps for civil\n            service reforms. However, the politically sensitive public\n            sector reform agenda may be jeopardized by vested interest\n            groups, while capacity constraints are also risks that may\n
