Some lessons\n            learned included: when problems arise from perceived or real\n            inconsistencies between legal documents or ambiguity, the\n            Bank team must involve the participation of legal experts in\n            resolving such inconsistencies or ambiguities. The project\n            development objective (PDO) of the project must be\n            formulated in a way that is fully coherent with the scope of\n            the project. The lack of implementation capacity or\n            experience in the implementing agency must be addressed in a\n            proactive way, before it translates into shortcomings in\n            project implementation. When the participation of third\n            parties is needed for the project implementation, it is\n            important to engage with those parties during project design\n            to assess realistically their ability and willingness to\n            participate.
