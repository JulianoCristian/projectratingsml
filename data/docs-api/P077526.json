Some lessons learned includes: the lack of\n            experience in project management should be addressed at an\n            early stage, providing the owner with greater support in its\n            role by hiring an experienced project advisor. Although\n            turnkey projects are often seen as a good way to reduce\n            project risk, the Vlore project is a good example of why the\n            owner must maintain a continuous presence in order to ensure\n            the success of a turnkey project. In large engineering\n            projects it is common practice to have a panel of experts to\n            provide counsel and different points of view on solving\n            problems during construction. The Vlore project was\n            contracted using World Bank procurement documents. Opportune\n            restructuring of a project should be performed through a\n            continuous tracking of performance indicators. The Vlore\n            project shows how the lack of attention to the relevance of\n            indicators impacted negatively on the completion assessment\n            and how this failing could have been addressed at an early stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Power Sector Generation and\n            Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Power Sector Generation\n

Albania's electricity needs, furthermore,\n            are supplied almost solely by hydropower, which suffers\n            during drought. With the climate in Albania projected to be\n            significantly warmer and drier in the coming decades,\n            hydropower will likely face further constraints. In May 2007\n            the Inspection Panel registered a request for inspection\n            concerning the Albania Power Sector Generation and\n            Restructuring Project. The Requesters expressed a number of\n            concerns regarding the Bank's compliance with its\n            operational policies. After deeming the request eligible for\n            inspection and conducting an investigation, on August 7,\n            2009 the Panel issued its report outlining the findings of\n            its investigation. The progress report addresses the\n            implementation of the Management Action Plan in reference to\n            the inspection panel review of the Bank-financed Albania\n            Power Sector Generation and Restructuring Project. Following\n            an update on the general implementation of the project,\n            information is provided on progress on ten key topics\n            addressed by the Management Action Plan. The first four are\n            project-specific issues: (i) finalizing project oil spill\n            prevention and response measures; (ii) monitoring emissions\n            from plant operations; (iii) continuing management of\n            cultural property after project appraisal; and (iv)\n            bolstering utility company engagement with the public.\n            Progress on strengthening Albania's engagement with\n            stakeholders more broadly is addressed through: (v)\n            improving compliance with international environmental\n            obligations. Progress on a final set of five issues relates\n            to improving Bank operational performance: (vi)\n            strengthening social assessment in the ECA region, (vii)\n            improving staff awareness of borrower country international\n            obligations, (viii) avoiding potential conflict of interest\n            on environmental impact assessment for category A projects,\n            (ix) improving external communications and response by the\n            World Bank office in Tirana, and (x) sharing safeguards\n            lessons learned from this Inspection Panel case with staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

Management responded to the claims in the request\n            on June 1, 2007. In its report to the Board thereafter, the\n            panel found the request eligible and recommended that the\n            Executive Directors authorize an investigation. On August 7,\n            2009, the panel issued its report outlining the findings of\n            the investigation. Management appreciates the panel's\n            clear and thorough presentation of its findings. This\n            report, responding to the findings of the panel, is\n            organized in four sections. Section two provides background\n            information on the project. Section three discusses key\n            issues and Section four presents management's action\n            plan in response to the panel's findings. Section five\n            contains the conclusion. The panel's findings, along\n            with the management's responses, are described in\n            detail in annex one; annex two provides information on air\n            emissions modeling;
