The results of this\n            project are similar to those of a number of other\n            agricultural development projects in Yugoslavia. While most\n            of the construction targets for agro-processing facilities\n            were achieved despite procurement delays, the profitability\n            of the constructed facilities has remained well below\n            appraisal expectations and some of the enterprises may face\n            liquidation. Whether the project could sustain a positive\n            level of economic benefits in the economic environment that\n            presently exists in Yugoslavia is open to question. A lesson\n            to be drawn from the experience with this project is that\n            substantive issues such as interest rate policy need to be\n            resolved decisively even at the cost of deferring loan\n            approval. Although the severe deterioration of the\n            macroeconomic situation could not have been anticipated at\n            appraisal, the Bank should have taken into account its\n            earlier experience in Kosovo."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Kosovo Agroindustries and\n            Agricultural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Kosovo\n            Agroindustries and Agricultural Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/08/735910/yugoslavia-kosovo-agroindustries-agricultural-development-project","projn":"Kosovo Agric.
