A lesson learned\n            included the government following a traditional and cautious\n            reform approach focused on the development of new\n            instruments and their pilot-testing in a growing number of\n            ministries. The reform was pursued without changing the\n            legal and regulatory framework, a part from the reform on\n            internal controls. While limiting risks, this approach has\n            led to a reform fatigue, with many ministries now in a\n            waiting mode. The visibility of the reform needs to be\n            strengthened both within the administration and with members\n            of the public, taxpayers, and users of public services. The\n            time scale for this kind of complex structural reforms (ten\n            years on average) makes it hard to achieve visible results\n            in the short to medium term. The crosscutting and very\n            technical nature of these reforms make it difficult to\n            establish a link with visible government services. It is\n            therefore necessary to increase information and\n            communication on the reform, based on clear short-term\n            results and planned according to the rapid results approach.\n            Giving increased attention to public service provision and\n            providers and strengthening synergies with related reforms,\n            such as the quality of public services approach and the\n            fight against corruption, will increase the reform's\n            visibility and short-term benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Third and Fourth Public\n

Third Public Administration\n            Reform Development Policy Loan"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Third Public Administration Reform\n            Development Policy Loan for Morocco, initiated in 2003, aims\n            at: (a) improving government efficiency in the management of\n            budget resources through greater transparency and\n            accountability, and by introducing performance measurement;\n            and (b) improving government efficiency in the management of\n            human resources through the preparation of a new management\n            system for staffing and remuneration with performance\n            measurement, while streamlining current human resources\n            management. There are four components to the project. The\n            first component is the greater visibility of policies and\n            their medium-term budgetary implications by placing\n            budgetary allocation decisions in a multiyear framework. The\n            objective of this component is to design and implement an\n            aggregate Medium-Tern Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The MTEF\n            is expected to set multiyear sector budget ceilings, while\n            taking into account sector MTEFs derived from explicit\n            intra- and inter sector priorities. Thus, these ceilings are\n            consistent with the Medium Term Fiscal Framework ( MTFF),\n            helping to ensure a more predictable and transparent fiscal\n            policy. The second component is to improve efficiency in\n            Human Resource Management (HRM). The objectives of the\n            program are to modernize the current civil service by\n            putting competences and performance at the core of the new\n            system while keeping a career system. It also creates modern\n            HRM tools to adapt civil service to key public sector\n            missions and to manage staff in a more efficient manner. The\n            new remuneration system, together with the mainstreaming of\n            the Strategic Staffing Frameworks (RECs), will be a key\n            achievement in the overall Human Resource (HR) reform\n            program. The third component is to consolidate and control\n            public payroll decrease. The key challenge in this component\n            remains the high, albeit decreasing, share of the wage bill\n            with respect to the country's income. Finally, the\n            fourth component is the e-government and simplification of\n            procedures. This new subprogram promotes the development of\n            e-government as a key complementary tool for Morocco's\n            public administration reforms. It focuses on e-government to\n            simplify procedures and thus improve the efficiency,\n            effectiveness, transparency, and accountability of the\n            administrations. In addition, it uses e-government as an\n            enabler of changes in behaviors, processes, and organization\n            to transform these public entities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Third

There are four components to the project. The\n            first component is the greater visibility of policies and\n            their medium-term budgetary implications by placing\n            budgetary allocation decisions in a multiyear framework. The\n            objective of this component is to design and implement an\n            aggregate Medium-Tern Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The MTEF\n            is expected to set multiyear sector budget ceilings, while\n            taking into account sector MTEFs derived from explicit\n            intra- and inter sector priorities. Thus, these ceilings are\n            consistent with the Medium Term Fiscal Framework ( MTFF),\n            helping to ensure a more predictable and transparent fiscal\n            policy. The second component is to improve efficiency in\n            Human Resource Management (HRM). The objectives of the\n            program are to modernize the current civil service by\n            putting competences and performance at the core of the new\n            system while keeping a career system. It also creates modern\n            HRM tools to adapt civil service to key public sector\n            missions and to manage staff in a more efficient manner. The\n            new remuneration system, together with the mainstreaming of\n            the Strategic Staffing Frameworks (RECs), will be a key\n            achievement in the overall Human Resource (HR) reform\n            program. The third component is to consolidate and control\n            public payroll decrease. The key challenge in this component\n            remains the high, albeit decreasing, share of the wage bill\n            with respect to the country's income. Finally, the\n            fourth component is the e-government and simplification of\n            procedures. This new subprogram promotes the development of\n            e-government as a key complementary tool for Morocco's\n            public administration reforms. It focuses on e-government to\n            simplify procedures and thus improve the efficiency,\n            effectiveness, transparency, and accountability of the\n            administrations. In addition, it uses e-government as an\n            enabler of changes in behaviors, processes, and organization\n            to transform these public entities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Royalme du Maroc
