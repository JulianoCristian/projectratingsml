This\n            disadvantage is acceptable if the tight timetable helps\n            focus the country on the needed reforms and other\n            commitments at a time when there is economy adversity. 7)\n            Implementation flexibility is important to maximize\n            effectiveness of loan proceeds. 8) Firm stance on extensions\n            often heightens compliance with
