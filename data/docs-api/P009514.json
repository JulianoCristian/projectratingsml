The key lessons learned are: 1) An\n            important element in the project implementation was the\n            Government's sustained commitment to improving\n            education in Bangladesh, especially primary education. 2)\n            The Government has increasingly worked with all the\n            stakeholders in the education sector to augment\n            implementation capacity and improve outcomes of education.\n            Particularly important were the larger roles of communities\n            in establishing and managing schools, and the participation\n            of non-governmental organizations in the sector. 3) The\n            project results underscore the importance of institutional\n            development for both increasing the efficiency of resource\n            use and improving the project's outcomes. In the\n            future, institutional capacity needs to be strengthened for\n            program planning and monitoring, for developing\n            cost-effective impact strategies and for financial\n            management. 4) It takes the combination of many elements and\n            a longer-term process to achieve better education outcomes.\n            Important examples are teacher training and management of\n            the education system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
