to improve the coverage, quality, and\n            efficiency of basic education in the nine northeastern\n            states, where basic education has been particularly\n            deficient. It will assist the federal government, the\n            states, and 248 selected municipalities to implement the\n            first phase of a long-term national basic education\n            development plan aimed at correcting imbalances in\n            educational opportunities. The project provides for\n            construction of classrooms, curricula development and\n            production of textbooks and learning materials, training of\n            teachers and supervisors, a pilot school meals program,\n            strengthening of municipal education administration, and\n            evaluation and school mapping studies. Project beneficiaries\n            will include some 23,000 rural teachers and 2,000\n            supervisors to be upgraded during the project period, and\n            about 800,000 students who will be affected annually at\n            project completion by the various project components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Northeast Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -
