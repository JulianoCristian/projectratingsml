The lessons learned during the\n            implementation were that a special bankruptcy program and\n            the existing council of creditors on the demand side, had to\n            deal with the problem of a large, loss-making former state\n            enterprise. There was a market failure on the supply side,\n            which was addressed through establishing an agency for\n            restructuring assistance as a special agency. It is\n            important to build a critical mass of advisors and\n            successful managers to firmly establish the new corporate\n            culture. Publicizing results and developing effective\n            marketing services are important tools to accelerate\n            privatization. Making a transition from central planning to\n            a market economy and related enterprise reform is an\n            enormous task. The process usually involves new laws, and\n            changes in patterns of behavior. The Bank provided resources\n            for horizontal learning between clients in need of advice\n            and advisors who had practical experience of \"best\n            practice\" restructuring in similar transition\n            economies. The creation of industrial parks was a successful\n            restructuring option enabling internal transformation of\n            assets instead of promoting external replacement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -

In particular, the project will: 1) accelerate\n            the emergence and growth of small and medium scale\n            enterprises (SMEs); 2) streamline larger enterprises and\n            release currently unproductive assets into the market, thus\n            creating smaller, focused companies; 3) increase the\n            efficiency of resource mobilization and credit allocation\n            through the provision of assistance to restructure the\n            banking system; and 4) strengthen the infrastructure for\n            banking activity, and provide institutional development\n            support for solvent banks. The project will comprise two\n            components: 1) an enterprise sector strengthening component\n            (ESSC); and 2) a financial sector strengthening component\n            (FSSC). The ESSC will facilitate the growth of a population\n            of viable and competitive enterprises by providing technical\n            assistance for rationalizing selected larger enterprises and\n            by providing private SMEs with the technical assistance\n            necessary to prepare bankable investment projects. The ESSC\n            will also provide computer hardware and software to assist\n            in strengthening the ability of the tax administration\n            within the Ministry of Finance to collect taxes in a timely\n            fashion and lower transaction costs. The FSSC will provide\n            resources -a credit line- through qualified participating\n            banks, for medium-term loans to private and privatized\n            enterprises. This component will also: 1) assist with the\n            development of banking skills in the participating banks; 2)\n            strengthen the payments system through the provision of\n            computer software and hardware for the clearing center at\n            the National Bank of Moldova (NBM); and 3) support further\n            institutional development -including automation- for NBM

In particular, the project will: 1) accelerate\n            the emergence and growth of small and medium scale\n            enterprises (SMEs); 2) streamline larger enterprises and\n            release currently unproductive assets into the market, thus\n            creating smaller, focused companies; 3) increase the\n            efficiency of resource mobilization and credit allocation\n            through the provision of assistance to restructure the\n            banking system; and 4) strengthen the infrastructure for\n            banking activity, and provide institutional development\n            support for solvent banks. The project will comprise two\n            components: 1) an enterprise sector strengthening component\n            (ESSC); and 2) a financial sector strengthening component\n            (FSSC). The ESSC will facilitate the growth of a population\n            of viable and competitive enterprises by providing technical\n            assistance for rationalizing selected larger enterprises and\n            by providing private SMEs with the technical assistance\n            necessary to prepare bankable investment projects. The ESSC\n            will also provide computer hardware and software to assist\n            in strengthening the ability of the tax administration\n            within the Ministry of Finance to collect taxes in a timely\n            fashion and lower transaction costs. The FSSC will provide\n            resources -a credit line- through qualified participating\n            banks, for medium-term loans to private and privatized\n            enterprises. This component will also: 1) assist with the\n            development of banking skills in the participating banks; 2)\n            strengthen the payments system through the provision of\n            computer software and hardware for the clearing center at\n            the National Bank of Moldova (NBM); and 3) support further\n            institutional development -including automation- for NBM as\n            a whole."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -
