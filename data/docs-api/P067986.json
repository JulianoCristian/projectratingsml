This type of contract is widely used\n            for supervising construction and was thus correctly and in\n            good faith used to hire ESEO (Works Supervision Firm -\n            Empresa Supervisora de Estudios y Obras). However, the\n            contract lacked incentives for ESEO to push the construction\n            firms for results, timely compliance with the milestones,\n            and adhering to their schedule, since their payments were\n            not contingent on the firms' progress. Working with\n            joint ventures for civil works can be challenging. This\n            project provided a case of ineffective joint ventures. The\n            firms selected lacked previous experience in hospital\n            construction. The foreign firm did not have a solid presence\n            and network in the country, which meant it could not\n            effectively communicate with the Project Coordination Unit\n            (PCU). The design and implementation experience of restoring\n            physical assets after a disaster shows the importance of\n            assessing the appropriateness of ERL in terms of time and\n            resources, and reassessing the needs and design against the\n            latest sectoral trends. Besides, the component one\n            preparation timeline and available budget were not\n            sufficient to realistically assess the damage and health\n            sector needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Earthquake Emergency\n            Reconstruction and Health Services Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador - Earthquake\n

earthquake-damaged areas, in particular the\n            underserved populations of the poverty-stricken Northern\n            Region. The components will support: 1) an emergency\n            reconstruction of the Ministry of Health (MOH) hospital\n            network in the earthquake affected areas, through a phased\n            construction that will meet current seismic structural\n            codes. Equipment supply will include computerization,\n            medical waste disposal equipment, and medical equipment.\n            Technical assistance (TA) will be financed to cover\n            environmental impact studies, topographical analyses, and\n            engineering drawings; 2) the extension of essential health\n            and nutrition services to damaged, and poor areas, by\n            forming partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and\n            local government agencies, to strengthen MOH capacity,\n            towards an integrated service delivery of health and\n            nutrition services. Participatory outreach programs with\n            communities will be established, including the development\n            of management reforms in those reconstructed hospitals, to\n            establish accountability systems, and health coverage in\n            rural areas; 3) strengthening of MOH's capacity to\n            perform public health programs, with improved quality and\n            disease surveillance, regulation and performance-based\n            monitoring; and, 4) project management, including the\n            project's overall impact evaluation, and financial audits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Earthquake Emergency\n            Reconstruction and Health Services Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador - Earthquake\n            Emergency Reconstruction and Health Services Extension Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/10/1615101/el-salvador-earthquake-emergency-reconstruction-health-services-extension-project","projn":"SV-- Earthquake Emergency Recovery &\n            Health Services Extension Pro -- P067986","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"El Salvador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01111004014520"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic health care,basic health\n            services,cervical cancer,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,communities,discrimination,Districts,Economic\n            Analysis,environmental\n            health,epidemics,equipment,Expenditures,Extension,feasibility\n            studies,Financial Management,health care,health care\n            services,health centers,health clinics,health\n            expenditures,health facilities,health indicators,health\n            interventions,health needs,health outcomes,health\n            policy,health programs,health promotion,health\n            providers,health sector,Health Services,health status,health\n            system,health workers,HIV infection,homes,hospital\n            beds,Hospitals,households,Human resource\n            management,immunization,income,Infant mortality,infectious\n            diseases,inhabitants,intermediaries,Intervention,laboratories,malaria,malnutrition,managers,medical\n            care,mortality,new technologies,NGOs,Non- governmental\n            organizations,Nutrition,overcrowding,patient\n            satisfaction,patients,population groups,poverty\n            alleviation,pregnant women,primary care,private\n            sector,public health,public hospitals,public\n            sector,Rehabilitation,Resettlement,rural areas,Rural\n            Development,Rural Health Care,schools,screening,service\n            delivery,sex workers,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,social\n            services,STDs,surgery,tents,urban areas,vaccination,Waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"basic health care,basic health\n            services,cervical cancer,clinics,communicable\n            diseases,communities,discrimination,Districts,Economic\n            Analysis,environmental\n            health,epidemics,equipment,Expenditures,Extension,feasibility\n            studies,Financial Management,health care,health care\n            services,health centers,health clinics,health\n            expenditures,health facilities,health indicators,health\n            interventions,health needs,health outcomes,health\n            policy,health programs,health promotion,health\n            providers,health sector,Health Services,health status,health\n            system,health workers,HIV infection,homes,hospital\n            beds,Hospitals,households,Human resource\n            management,immunization,income,Infant mortality,infectious\n            diseases,inhabitants,intermediaries,Intervention,laboratories,malaria,malnutrition,managers,medical\n            care,mortality,new technologies,NGOs,Non- governmental\n            organizations,Nutrition,overcrowding,patient\n            satisfaction,patients,population groups,poverty\n            alleviation,pregnant women,primary care,private\n            sector,public health,public hospitals,public\n            sector,Rehabilitation,Resettlement,rural areas,Rural\n            Development,Rural Health Care,schools,screening,service\n            delivery,sex workers,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,social\n            services,STDs,surgery,tents,urban areas,vaccination,Waste"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF025836-PHRD-SOCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM","repnb":"22626"},"facets":{}}}
