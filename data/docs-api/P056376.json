reforms launched by the government of Malawi since 1994.\n            This credit improves public expenditure management and\n            promotes private sector development; helps meet the balance\n

The Credit's financing for technical\n            support, training, and equipment will specifically 1)\n            implement the medium term expenditure framework, auditing\n            and reviewing the development budget, reforming expenditure\n            control procedures and systems; 2) evaluate the impact of\n            structural reforms on Malawi's economy, in particular\n            by examining the effects of liberalizing trade and exchange\n            rate policy on manufacturing, and liberalizing agriculture\n            production and trade on the agriculture sector; and 3)\n            develop the agenda for the next round of macroeconomic and\n            sectoral policy reforms through research into further\n            constraints to growth.
