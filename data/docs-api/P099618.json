Some lessons learned included: one particular\n            lesson is the importance of ensuring that the client\n            prioritizes achievement of reform objectives over the\n            implementation of a set of measures. To that effect, the\n            operation includes strengthening of the accountability\n            framework for reforms implementation, monitoring and impact\n            evaluation. To facilitate this, the Bank has made\n            considerable efforts during preparation in encouraging and\n            supporting the energy sector observatory department of the\n            MEMEE (Ministere de l'Energie, des Mines, de l'Eau\n            et de l'Environment - Ministry of energy, mines, water\n            and the environment) to take on the responsibilities of\n            monitoring the progress and impact of sector reform. It may\n            also be useful, in this context, to take into account the\n            particular time and effort it takes for implementation\n            rather than, background work on formulating laws and sector\n            strategies. This means providing for the time and work\n            required for relevant by-laws, decrees and their adoption by\n            the appropriate institutions as well as relevant\n            complementary capacity-building needed for effective\n            application of the new provisions. The original ambitious\n            timetable for the programmatic Development Policy Lending\n            (DPL) could not be adhered to, in part due to the\n            complexities of the programme. This raises the question\n            whether a programmatic (rather than single-tranche) DPL, and\n            the adherence to a timeline for the individual components it\n            implies, is the right instrument for this kind of broad\n            policy reform in the Moroccan energy sector (with its\n            complexities and consequent tendency to slow reforms, and\n            its large number of interest groups involved). A\n            single-tranche DPL may be more manageable, and thus\n            ultimately more effective - unless the team is highly\n            confident of being able to meet the time schedule associated\n            with a programmatic series, which was not the case in the\n            present one. The problems that arose for the DPL from the\n            change in government have been alluded to several times in\n            this implementation completion report (ICR). This raises the\n            question of timing of the starting time for DPL, and\n            suggests that a complex energy DPL might better be started\n            somewhat earlier in a government's term. This may\n            mitigate problems arising from the changes in political\n            preferences, key staff, or even institutional structures\n            that a new government may bring, replacing it with the\n            important continuous engagement throughout implementation\n            with the very same government that had initially agreed on\n            the measures contained in the DPL."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
