Key lessons learned during project\n            implementation include: 1) The quality of implementation\n            depended very much on the level of precision and rigor in\n            preparing and appraising the components of the project. 2)\n            More emphasis should be put on the use of consultants and on\n            training. 3) Creation of Project Implementation Unit was\n            deemed to be an appropriate decision to smooth project\n            implementation. 4) Delays must be anticipated prior to the\n            project implementation phase. 5) Land reclamation and\n            resettlement issues must be properly assessed prior to\n            project implementation. 6) Close collaboration between the\n            Port Enterprises and the overseeing ministry would help\n            better define the scope and design of the infrastructure. 7)\n            Comparisons of implementation experiences in the different\n            ports brought to light the fact that the many delays were\n            caused also by the lack of information concerning available\n            land, environmental impact, and the relocation of occupants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria -
