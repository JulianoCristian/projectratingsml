Some lessons learned included: coupling park\n            management activities with local partnerships and awareness\n            raising programs has a strong positive impact on improving\n            community perceptions. The project demonstrated that the\n            partnerships with schools, research institutions, media and\n            local private sector helped solidify the collaborative\n            spirit towards nature conservation objectives in each of the\n            regions, improved the understanding and positive perceptions\n            of the local people and significantly reduced the number of\n            illegal activities. Among the three parks, Jbil proved to be\n            more challenging in this aspect given the small number of\n            communities, many of which are not settled. In future, a\n            dedicated awareness strategy based on the specific\n            characteristics of each park is merited. Fostering local\n            partnerships for knowledge generation of the existing\n            biodiversity in a park enhances its management capacity.\n            Rather than mobilizing a large scale technical assistance,\n            the Project Management Unit (PMU) has contracted several\n            research institutes, science faculties and consultants to\n            carry out small-scale analytical works on very specific\n            subject matters. This approach showed that a very rich and\n            useful information base could be obtained at a lower cost\n            than with classical technical assistance, and engages local\n            institutions for more sustainable partnership relations. It\n            is important to manage expectations about what can be\n            achieved in a first phase of a participatory natural\n            resources management project. The project required\n            significant time and resources to set up the participatory\n            planning methodology, with a strong element of learning by\n            doing as it went forward. Also, there was a need to bring\n            the parks to a level where the minimum infrastructure\n            required for receiving increased visitor numbers are in\n            place. These are prerequisites to the launch of successful\n            eco-tourism activities, which require more sophisticated\n            institutional collaboration structures across different\n            sectors and can be envisaged in a follow-on phase."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Protected Areas Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Protected Areas\n

welfare of local populations. The\n            project's approach to biodiversity conservation is\n            based on community participation. The participatory approach\n            will be carried out through the coordination with national,\n            governorate, and local level institutions. Some of the\n            project components may trigger the Bank's policy on\n            involuntary resettlement, which also includes specific\n            provision for the loss of access to natural resources in\n            parks and protected areas. To achieve its objectives of\n            biodiversity conservation, the project may require the\n            restriction of access to the resources in the defined core\n            areas that are currently utilized by the population. The\n            Park Management Team (PMT) for each protected area will be\n            the main executors of the process framework. During the\n            project implementation, when conflicting views concerning\n            the utilization of resources arise, the Development\n            Committee and PMT will be the forum for dispute resolution.\n            If no acceptable solutions can be reached, claims will be\n            presented to the Local Development Council. Should conflicts\n            still remain, the claims will be settled by the Regional\n            Development Council.
