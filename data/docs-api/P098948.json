Municipalities and elected\n            mayors and council members had to make tough choices on\n            tariff adjustments and enforce connections. Absence that\n            support, implementation can be delayed and utility\n            performance minimal. Political commitment must also be\n            sustained at the central level to implement reforms to move\n            the sector towards European Union (EU) compliance. It is\n            important for Croatian Waters (HV) and the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MoA) to maintain strong capacity, a clear\n            sector vision, and to sustain their commitment to\n            agglomerate utilities. While some utilities had the capacity\n            to implement, engage beneficiaries, and supervise the works\n            effectively, others required considerable support from HV.\n            In the weakest utilities works were delayed. This indicates\n            that a further concentration of utilities will not only\n            foster financial but also technical efficiency. The Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) took some risk in selecting\n            financially weaker and less capable utilities, but the\n            investment and payoff proved worthwhile. The location of the\n            task team leader and operations officer in Croatia and\n            Central Europe helped the project advance at critical\n            moments. This was especially the case in the final years of\n            project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Inland Waters Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Inland
