Lessons learned included: the project team\n            took client ownership very seriously, making a real effort\n            to listen to officials and stakeholders and tailoring the\n            project to their needs. In all areas, Sri Lankans called the\n            shots and sought Bank technical advice only when necessary.\n            The project incorporated an unallocated pool of resources,\n            the Challenge Fund. Although initially received with a\n            healthy degree of skepticism, the Challenge Fund has\n            provided space for successive administrations to alter the\n            course of the reforms and still be able to benefit from Bank\n            funding without having to design a new project. It has also\n            helped the Bank respond almost immediately with post-tsunami\n            assistance. Realizing that each administration has a small\n            window of opportunity to push reform initiatives, the Bank\n            committed to a quick turnaround on all Technical Assistance\n            (TA) requests and after initial teething problems was able\n            to come to a two to three day turnaround for all requests.\n            Establishing capacity to handle the procurement and\n            management of more than 100 consultancies in the first two\n            years of operation was critical to success. It also meant\n            that line ministries could focus on management of the reform\n            and leave the administrative aspects to others."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Economic Reform

This would potentially\n            entail wider environmental impacts, associated with both\n            public, and private civil works, and construction. This\n            framework for environmental screening sets the stage to\n            identify environmental problems, and liabilities due to the\n            implementation of the project, to further generate\n            environmental compliance with the national laws. An\n            environmental auditing process - Phase I and II which may be\n            completed concurrently - should finally confirm the presence\n            of specific forms of environmental liability. Phase I\n            identifies site selection, aerial emissions, wastewater\n            discharges, waste storage and disposal, as well as\n            precautions to be taken due to hazardous materials, fire\n            occurrence, and/or occupational health and safety issues.\n            Phase II involve intrusive sampling of environmental issues,\n            such as soils, groundwater and surface waters, and\n            building/insulating materials. While it is anticipated that\n            the auditing process will be sufficient, it is possible\n            however, that significant contamination may occur, in which\n            case a risk assessment may be required. The assessment\n            involves the identification, quantification, and allocation\n            of environmental liabilities. Monitoring criteria will be\n            the responsibility of the implementing agency, based on\n            institutional arrangements for the full compliance with the\n            objectives set within this framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Economic Reform Technical\n            Assistance Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Economic

This will be achieved by funding priority technical\n            assistance that will provide government with the executive\n            capacity required to implement its reform agenda. The\n            implementation of the government's economic reforms\n            will in turn expand the role of the private sector in the\n            economy and put the country on the path of higher economic\n            growth and faster poverty reduction. There are four project\n            components. The first component strengthens the\n            government's reform management capacity. The second\n            component privatizes the People's Bank; provides\n            technical assistance for the Asset Management Company;\n            builds the capacity of the non-bank financial regulator;\n            finances the establishment of the Pensions Reform Office,\n            and supports private sector participation in the water\n            sector; finds assistance to the Public Utilities Commission;\n            and finances the regulatory framework for the\n            telecommunications sector. The third component supports the\n            design and implementation of a suitable mass communications\n            strategy. The fourth component establishes and operates the\n            Challenge Fund, which will manage a pool of technical\n            assistance funds that can be flexibly allocated to\n            sub-projects. This Fund will allow the relevant line\n            ministries and government entities to respond flexibly to a\n            dynamic and developing agenda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Economic
