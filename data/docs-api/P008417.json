Ratings for the First Municipal Development\n            and Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            low; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Ratings for the Second Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included from the\n            project: in providing assistance for the reform of any\n            sector municipal in this case-Bank and Borrower need also to\n            help ensure that information systems are adequate for\n            implementing the reforms and for monitoring progress. In the\n            case of these three projects, information on municipal\n            finances and on the economic performance of sub-project\n            investments was sparse. Georgia's situation in this\n            regard could be improved by the greater use of municipal\n            experiences of other countries. Political volatility\n            provides unusual challenges and opportunities for Bank\n            supervision. It calls for more thorough documentation than\n            normal, detailing all actions agreed between Bank and\n            Borrower. It also requires greater oversight of project\n            financial management. In the case of Georgia, it did provide\n            opportunities for the Bank to act as valued and stable\n            interlocutor in times of change. Major political and\n            economic transition, while offering opportunities for\n            reform, may slow down progress with municipal reform in\n            particular, as national governments work to establish the\n            effectiveness of their central control. When municipal\n            management is very weak overall, it makes sense to work\n            first with stronger and creditworthy municipalities that are\n            most likely to succeed. In Georgia, the national government\n            could recognize and foster these municipalities as models of\n            good practice and sources for inspiration and technical\n            assistance for others to learn from."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Municipal Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation Project: First Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization Project;

Lessons learned suggest that the\n            project's responsiveness to the country's\n            priorities generated strong commitments to project\n            implementation in the initial three years, particularly\n            important given Georgia's unfamiliarity with project\n            procedures. However, this responsiveness to rapid\n            preparation, though beneficial, encountered costs, and\n            losses, such as the need to build institutional capacity, in\n            particular financial discipline, transparency, and\n            competitive procurement. This diversification in the lending\n            portfolio led to declining Bank supervision resources,\n            unable to provide the assistance needed by the borrower.\n            Nonetheless, the strong, initial support by the Bank,\n            provided the impulse for this investment project to move\n            forward, which in hindsight, may have even prevented greater\n            deterioration in project performance during the final years\n            of implementation. But the application of Bank procurement\n            guidelines seems unrealistic, given the country's\n            recent political unrest, which conflicted with international\n            procurement attempts, and, in retrospect, closing the\n            project as originally scheduled, made better use of scarce\n            resources, rather than extending the project to complete few\n            remaining contracts, since actually, procurement was largely completed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia -
