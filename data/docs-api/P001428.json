This was\n            amply demonstrated by its readiness to undertake a review of\n            the project contents early in the project execution period\n            and an agonizing reappraisal of the project towards the end.\n            The lesson that the Bank can draw from the project\n            experience is that preconceived notions of agricultural\n            development strategies and priorities, particularly when it\n            involves the uneducated poor traditional rural sector,\n            should be very critically examined at the time of project\n            preparation.
