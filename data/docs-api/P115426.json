Some\n            lessons learned included: a programmatic DPL with several\n            installments will likely have enabled further progress on\n            the policy agenda. While the Government appears to be\n            meeting its energy efficiency and renewable energy targets,\n            the pace of energy efficiency reforms has slowed down\n            somewhat after the DPL was approved. As this DPL\n            demonstrates, it is possible to deliver reforms even under\n            circumstances where achieving political consensus is at\n            times challenging; a programmatic DPL could have been\n            helpful in ensuring the sustainability of the reforms and\n            supporting further actions. The breadth and depth of the DPL\n            objectives stretched the capacity of the Government to\n            deliver. A DPL series could have helped alleviate this\n            constraint. For a single, one-off DPL it will have been\n            preferable if the agenda centered on only few of the most\n            important policies. Furthermore, it will have been also\n            helpful if some of the specific energy efficiency analytical\n            work currently under way would have been carried out already\n

Government of Poland faces a\n            dilemma: how can harmful emissions are decreased, while\n            maintaining its focus on economic growth to converge with\n            the European Union (EU)-15 and do this within a constrained\n            fiscal environment. The World Bank (the Bank) worked closely\n            with the Government during 2009-10 to address this conundrum\n            in preparing the 2011 report entitled 'transition to a\n            low emissions economy in Poland', analyzing the carbon\n            abatement potential in Poland and the associated economic\n            impact. The analysis identified energy efficiency and\n            selected renewable energy investments as the priority near-\n            to medium-term investments. Although energy efficiency\n            options are low cost, market penetration has been limited.\n            This DPL supports policy actions that are designed to\n            address market rigidities. Poland faces a problem in\n            achieving bold renewable energy targets as there is little\n            hydropower or deep geothermal potential and solar power is\n            expensive. Biomass applications have recently shown promise\n            and are, along with wind power and biogas, expected to be\n            the focus of attention in meeting Poland's 2020\n            renewable energy target of 15.0 percent of final energy\n            consumption from renewable energy sources. To support the\n            implementation of its renewable energy policy, the\n            Government has established a green certificates program that\n            obliges electricity suppliers to increase the share of\n            renewable energy in their portfolio. In addition, subsidies\n            are available from EC funds used to help decrease renewable\n            energy investment costs as part of the transition to reduce emissions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Energy Efficiency and Renewable\n            Energy Development Policy Loan (DPL) Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Energy Efficiency and\n
