Among the many lessons\n            learned, main suggestions are as follows. Deficiencies in\n            initial project design can not be easily remedied midway\n            through implementation, unless effective restructuring is\n            undertaken: The most fundamental lesson from implementation\n            of this project is a very basic one, applicable to all\n            projects irrespective of sector or region: the importance of\n            project design can never be underestimated. Analytic sector\n            work would have highlighted many of the deficiencies in\n            project design, especially in identifying priority\n            challenges that needed to be tackled first in the worst off\n            regions. Another more specific lesson that arises from this\n            project is that efforts to revise a project that had\n            significantly flawed, original design requires more drastic\n            action than minor revisions and intensive supervision. The\n            Bank needs to adopt a culture where statements of expected\n            project impact are more realistic: the project development\n            objective responded very clearly to the needs of the country\n            at that time. However, part of the failure of the project to\n            have any measurable impact, rests squarely on the fact that\n            the project over promised in its statement of expected\n            impact on major health indicators, by the end of project\n            implementation. The expected project impact should have been\n            stated more modestly, particularly taking into account the\n            fact that there are other important determinants of health\n            outcomes, not being addressed by this particular project.\n            Further lessons address a) attention to recommendations from\n            reviews of design quality; b) maintaining a dialogue on\n            global good practices in the midst of unsatisfactory\n            implementation; and, c) the role of project coordination\n            units in assisting Borrowers to produce sustainable, and\n            appropriate outputs needs careful evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
