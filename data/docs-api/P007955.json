Peru's\n            topographical, geological, and climatic conditions make the\n            provision of transport facilities extremely difficult. The\n            transport network reflects these difficulties and has shaped\n            the country's geographic development accordingly. Since\n            the nineteenth century, several isolated railways have been\n            built by private interests to connect mining areas in the\n            Sierra with coastal ports. Even today, railways and ports\n            are highly specialized and operate mainly as transport\n            systems for the export of minerals. Only highways and, much\n            more recently, civil aviation have played an important role\n            in integrating the country, but the lack of an adequate\n            transport network remains one of the most difficult problems\n            confronting Peru. This completion report is based on\n            information obtained from the Latin America and Caribbean\n            (LAC) information center, appraisal report no. 302a-PE,\n            staff supervision reports, project progress reports, final\n            construction reports of the Ministerio de Transportes y\n            Comunicaciones (MTC), and information gathered during a\n
