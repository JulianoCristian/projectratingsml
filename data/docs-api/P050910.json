Ratings for the First Municipal Development\n            and Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            low; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Ratings for the Second Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included from the\n            project: in providing assistance for the reform of any\n            sector municipal in this case-Bank and Borrower need also to\n            help ensure that information systems are adequate for\n            implementing the reforms and for monitoring progress. In the\n            case of these three projects, information on municipal\n            finances and on the economic performance of sub-project\n            investments was sparse. Georgia's situation in this\n            regard could be improved by the greater use of municipal\n            experiences of other countries. Political volatility\n            provides unusual challenges and opportunities for Bank\n            supervision. It calls for more thorough documentation than\n            normal, detailing all actions agreed between Bank and\n            Borrower. It also requires greater oversight of project\n            financial management. In the case of Georgia, it did provide\n            opportunities for the Bank to act as valued and stable\n            interlocutor in times of change. Major political and\n            economic transition, while offering opportunities for\n            reform, may slow down progress with municipal reform in\n            particular, as national governments work to establish the\n            effectiveness of their central control. When municipal\n            management is very weak overall, it makes sense to work\n            first with stronger and creditworthy municipalities that are\n            most likely to succeed. In Georgia, the national government\n            could recognize and foster these municipalities as models of\n            good practice and sources for inspiration and technical\n            assistance for others to learn from."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Municipal Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation Project: First Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization Project;

Lessons\n            address three major subjects: (a) Rushing project\n            preparation may come at a cost: many Bank projects suffer\n            from excessively protracted and resource intensive\n            preparation. On the other hand, rushing the preparation of a\n            project, leaving details to be worked out to implementation,\n            is likely to cost a disproportionately high amount of\n            supervision resources, and carries the risk of significant\n            delays in project start up. These risks were exacerbated in\n            Georgia which, at the time of project preparation, was\n            barely emerging from years of political, and economic\n            turmoil, with little familiarity with the concepts, methods\n            and requirements of the Bank's lending standards.\n            Operations whose main focus is on institutional development,\n            cannot expect to be successful without a minimum time\n            devoted to prior policy dialogue, assessment of political\n            context, and institutional framework. (b) Political\n            commitment to reform should be cautiously assessed: The\n            depth of overall commitment to political reform is difficult\n            to judge, therefore caution should be exerted when\n            interpreting specific political statements, for transition\n            to democracy, like transition to market economy is a\n            lengthy, and complex process, that involves a wide variety\n            of actors, often with diverging interests. In such a\n            context, if targets for the development outcome are too\n            high, then. if the political process is delayed for one\n            reason or another, the operation may find itself at risk,\n            bereft of its objectives and reduced to disbursements as its\n            primary purpose, and measure of success. (c) Relying on\n            local capacity must be approached with carefulness:\n            developing, and promoting the use of local technical\n            capacity is a worthwhile objective. However, in a context\n            where capacity constraints abound, the performance of an\n            operation may be compromised. However, setting the\n            responsibility to work on decentralization, and local\n            government reform in the hands of local experts, even with\n            no prior exposure to these concepts, though risky, did\n            deliver modest results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization

       investment program; (3) support urgent local investments;\n            and (4) generate employment opportunities. The first of the\n            two main components, Institutional Development, has two\n            subcomponents: (1) helping to implement a municipal\n            development program centered on binding agreements (MDAs)\n            between the central government and participating\n            municipalities to improve organization and management,\n            including public services delivery, strengthen municipal\n            planning and programming procedures, human resource\n            planning, and physical investment project implementation\n            management, and (2) strengthening the central\n            government's capacity to implement effectively the\n            planned decentralization program by developing national\n            information systems, analyzing policy alternatives,\n            evaluating the impact of regional and sector investments on\n            municipal finance, establishing a project coordinating unit,\n            and supporting the initial investment and operating costs of\n            the Municipal Development Fund (MDF). The second component,\n            Physical Investments, will finance municipal investments\n            listed in the Priority Investment Plan (PIP). Investments\n            include construction rehabilitation and maintenance of\n            public infrastructure (primary and secondary facilities)\n            and services operated by local government, such as roads,\n            drainage, lighting, etc.; water supply, sanitation, and\n            solid waste management; revenue generating facilities;\n            health and school
