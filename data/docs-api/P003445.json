In\n            addition to other project-related benefits, the Project will\n            have a demonstration effect on other provincial machine tool\n            manufacturers as well as capital goods manufacturing industries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shanghai Machine Tool Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shanghai Machine Tool Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/01/740950/china-shanghai-machine-tool-project","projn":"CN-Shanghai Machinetool -- P003445","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Primary Metals,Water and Industry,General Manufacturing","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970701165738"},"subsc":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessories,appropriate\n            technology,automobile industry,bearings,Benefit\n            Streams,broad range,capital goods,cast\n            iron,casting,castings,coal,Construction,corporate\n            managers,developed countries,drilling,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic growth,employment,energy\n            efficiency,equipment,extension,feasibility\n            studies,Forging,forgings,Foundries,GNP,grinding\n            machines,gross national product,imports,Income,industrial\n            sector,Input Prices,Insurance,iron,lathes,machine\n            design,machine tool industry,machine\n            tools,machinery,machinery industry,manufactured\n            goods,manufacturers,manufactures,manufacturing,manufacturing\n            enterprises,manufacturing equipment,manufacturing\n            industries,manufacturing plant,manufacturing plants,marginal\n            costs,marketing,new technologies,pig iron,power\n            generation,producers,Production Costs,production\n            management,production planning,production quotas,Project\n            Management,quotas,raw materials,retained\n            earnings,Savings,steel,steel products,wire,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"accessories,appropriate\n            technology,automobile industry,bearings,Benefit\n            Streams,broad range,capital goods,cast\n            iron,casting,castings,coal,Construction,corporate\n            managers,developed countries,drilling,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic growth,employment,energy\n            efficiency,equipment,extension,feasibility\n            studies,Forging,forgings,Foundries,GNP,grinding\n            machines,gross national product,imports,Income,industrial\n            sector,Input Prices,Insurance,iron,lathes,machine\n            design,machine tool industry,machine\n            tools,machinery,machinery industry,manufactured\n            goods,manufacturers,manufactures,manufacturing,manufacturing\n            enterprises,manufacturing equipment,manufacturing\n            industries,manufacturing plant,manufacturing plants,marginal\n            costs,marketing,new technologies,pig iron,power\n            generation,producers,Production Costs,production\n            management,production planning,production quotas,Project\n            Management,quotas,raw materials,retained\n            earnings,Savings,steel,steel products,wire,wood"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia HQ Unit (EACCQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"5994"},"facets":{}}}
