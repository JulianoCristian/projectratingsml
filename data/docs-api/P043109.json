However, some\n            delays in processing payments to contractors remained an\n            issue which the Borrower needs to resolve. Key lessons\n            learned from the project include: Adoption of an appropriate\n            project design supported by good implementation arrangements\n            can deliver substantial benefits. This would include\n            detailed, adequate, and up-front arrangements to handle\n            human relations (especially coordination procedures between\n            government agencies and ministries), as well as employing\n            competent project staff and providing the right salary and\n            incentives. Requiring measurable local stakeholder\n            participation helps to target results and ensure\n            sustainability, but it also requires appropriate skills and\n            effort. It is unnecessary to create a bureacracy to deliver\n            substantial development benefits on a large number of sites.\n            Good and transparent business procedures lower costs and\n            build up institutional capacity and development.
