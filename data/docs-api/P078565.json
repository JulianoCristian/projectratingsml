Some lessons learned included: the link\n            between the effects of the Human Resources Management (HRM)\n            reform program and its impact on the size of the wage bill\n            has not been strong and future Public Administration Reform\n            Loan (PARL) should consider how to strengthen this linkage.\n            Containing the wage bill appears to have been less difficult\n            than anticipated since program measures were completed. Yet\n            resisting political pressure to raise salaries is difficult\n            for any government and should be prevented with sound\n            analytical capacity and adequate solutions. Reforms\n            requiring inter-ministerial coordination have moved slowly;\n            thus attention needs to be placed on how to strengthen\n            coordination. The spirit of public sector reform in Morocco\n            lies in adequate coordination across ministries. The\n            programmatic adjustment loan appears to be the appropriate\n            instrument for supporting public sector reforms in Morocco\n            as the country is proceeding step by step in a medium term\n            program. Morocco is a good case of using successive single\n            tranche adjustment loans as an effective way to assist\n            structural reform, provided there is a link to an agreed\n            medium-term reform program with well broadly defined\n            milestones and transparent triggers per subsequent\n            operation. Moroccan experience in multiplicating the number\n            of monitoring indicators has generated an unmanageably large\n            number of them, which prevents their effectiveness to\n            measure performance. Monitoring indicators should be limited\n            to a small number of the most pertinent measures and\n            performance audits should be simplified in order to make the\n            process more manageable, and reporting be made more timely."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - First and Second Public\n            Administration Reform Adjustment Loan Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - First and Second Public\n            Administration Reform Adjustment Loan Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/06/10952134/morocco-first-second-public-administration-reform-adjustment-loan-projects","projn":"MA-Morocco - Second Public Administration\n            Development Policy Loan -- P089677,MA-Morocco - Public Admin.

Lessons\n            learned from the project: Ownership by multiple stakeholders\n            is necessary for success of reform programs. The link\n            between the civil service reform program and the more macro\n            objective of wage bill containment has not been strong in\n            the early years of the Public Administration Reform\n            Adjustment Loan (PARL) program and PARL II should consider\n            how to strengthen the linkage. The early retirement scheme\n            was eventually able to attract sufficient participants but\n            an analysis of this scheme should be completed to understand\n            both its fiscal costs and the human resource costs.

The Bank's\n            analytical work and technical assistance helped the\n            Government design the reform program. Donor coordination\n            plays a major role in program success and the Bank should\n            make great efforts to preserve this unified dialogue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - First Public Administration Reform\n            Adjustment Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - First Public\n            Administration Reform Adjustment Loan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6226799/morocco-first-public-administration-reform-adjustment-loan","projn":"MA-Morocco - Public Admin.
