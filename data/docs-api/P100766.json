Some lessons learned includes: a more\n            realistic schedule will have been advisable, especially\n            since there were considerable, and properly identified,\n            risks; it may have avoided the need for an 18-month closing\n            date extension. An impending project closing date can bring\n            about the necessary actions to get a problem project back on\n            track. Frequent and intensive supervision by small\n            specialist teams can help greatly to resolve problems and\n            bottlenecks at the field level. It is important for the Bank\n            to be supportive when a project is delayed and may be closed\n            before its completion so that any commitments made by\n            Government to the communities can be met, and the\n            Government's credibility is not affected.

Kecamatan-Based Reconstruction\n            and Rehabilitation"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Kecamatan-Based Reconstruction and\n            Rehabilitation Project will be built on the existing\n            Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), which was already\n            operating in Nias prior to the tsunami and earthquake and\n            now covers the entire island. KDP consists of a facilitated\n            planning process that lets communities identify their own\n            priorities, which are then funded through a block grant\n            transferred directly to a bank account owned by all of the\n            villages within the kecamatan. Fifty percent of the funding\n            for the proposed project will come through an Multi-Donor\n            Trust Fund (MDTF) grant, and the other 50 percent will be\n            provided by the Government of Indonesia from national (APBN)\n            funding. Building on an existing project allows the program\n            to get off to a fast start. To keep the program manageable,\n            it is divided into 4 windows. The first window, the housing\n            window, will be initially confined to the four or five\n            affected kecamatans in each of Nias's two kabupaten,\n            for a total of 9 kecamatans and approximately 84 villages\n            (see Annex l), although some slight adjustment to these\n            numbers is likely to happen during final design allocations.\n            Project facilitators will work with communities to prepare\n            full village maps that show damage, reconstruction programs,\n            and uncovered needs; These will be the basis for each\n            reconstruction plan. Funding covers 5,000 housing units in\n            these 8-9 kecamatans. The second window is for schools,\n            UNICEF has already targeted reconstruction for the 120\n            priority schools that were affected by the tsunami. This\n            project will work with UNICEF and the Reconstruction and\n            Rehabilitation Agency for NAD & Nias (BRR) to define the\n            next 100 priority schools (primary and junior secondary)\n            using the same needs criteria. It will include an associated\n            school quality improvement program. The third window will\n            help village and kecamatan governments rebuild and equip\n            their offices, many of which have collapsed. It will include\n            training in participatory planning with a special focus on\n            achieving poverty reduction by providing a basic level of\n            public service delivery. The fourth window is for public\n            infrastructure that is linked to the settlement\n            reconstruction program. Based on the village maps, the\n            project will finance the public access and drainage\n            infrastructure that is needed by communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Kecamatan-Based Reconstruction\n            and Rehabilitation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Kecamatan-Based\n            Reconstruction and Rehabilitation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/11/7207145/indonesia-kecamatan-based-reconstruction-rehabilitation","projn":"ID-Kdp Nias -- P100766","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Urban Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Community Development and Empowerment,Social Accountability,Public & Municipal Finance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Social Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000310607_20061116170441"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Social Development","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, accounting, accounting\n            procedures, accounting records, ADB, auditors, audits,\n            beneficiaries, block grants, capacity development,\n            communities, community control, Community Development,\n            community facilitators, community grants, Community groups,\n            Community Participation, Community Participation in\n            Procurement, consensus, consultation, Corruption,\n            Employment, facilitators, financial administration,\n            Financial Management, Forests, government accountability,\n            housing, implementing agencies, independent auditor,\n            Indigenous Peoples, inflation, institutional capacity, local\n            communities, local government, local governments, Logical\n            Framework, MDF, negotiations, operating costs, operating\n            expenses, Pacific Region, participatory monitoring,\n            participatory planning, poverty reduction, preparation,\n            Procurement, PROJECT APPRAISAL, project design, project\n            implementation, project preparation, protected areas, public\n            access, public accountability, public housing, public\n            infrastructure, RECONSTRUCTION, risk management, service\n            delivery, Social analysis, Social Development, social\n            services, stakeholders, technical assistance, transparency,\n            utilities, village, villages, water supply"}},"owner":"Social Development Sector Unit (EASSO)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF055080-FUND FOR ACEH AND NORTH SUMATRA\n            - APPRAISAL, SUPERVISION, COMPLETION,TF057307-NIAS: KECAMATAN-BASED\n            RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PLANNING PROJEC","repnb":"37724"},"facets":{}}}
