Of the three project\n            development objective indicators, one was achieved fully,\n            one partially, and one was mostly achieved. Of the four\n            intermediate outcome indicators, two were fully achieved,\n            while the remaining two were fully achieved as per revised\n            targets, but only partially as per the original targets.\n            Significant lessons learned during project implementation\n            include: 1) community engagement is powerful, even in\n            conflict situations; 2) targeting and resource allocation\n            requires that bottom-up need assessment be balanced with\n            top-down planning and monitoring; 3) data is the cornerstone\n            for project targeting, implementation and result monitoring;\n            4) curriculum reforms are difficult; 5) interventions to\n            improve the teaching force are complex; 6) interventions to\n            provide education infrastructure need to take into account\n            the local market situation and the capacity of contractors\n            to deliver; 7) institutional assessment needs to be integral\n            part of the design; 8) ensuring high quality leadership is\n            critical for the project success; 9) project institutional\n            arrangements need to be clear; 10) projects, especially\n            projects in more fragile states, are subject to external and\n            sometimes unforeseen factors; and 11) project teams\n            including both the government and the Bank need to stay\n            flexible and agile."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan - Basic Education
