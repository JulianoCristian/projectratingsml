Some\n            lessons learned included: strong monitoring and evaluation\n            frameworks should be adopted for all project development\n            objectives (PDOs). This was not the case for the\n            access/equity PDO in the SECAL Project, a significant\n            oversight given the institutional mandate. This leaves a\n            void in evaluating the impact of the reforms on this issue.\n            In addition, health projects that aim to improve quality of\n            care should be modest about what can be measured.\n            Multi-tranche, multi-year policy-based development policy\n            lending is fraught with risk in an environment of political\n            uncertainty and implementation challenges. In these\n            circumstances, a programmatic series of single-tranche\n            operations should be given serious consideration as a means\n            to enhance flexibility. Policy-based lending in the health\n            sector is an important (and arguably under-utilized) Bank\n            instrument for promoting development objectives in the\n            common case where the political capital to undertake\n            difficult reforms, and not a lack of financial resources per\n            se, is the key binding constraint to strengthening sectoral\n            outcomes. Ministry of finance engagement is a critical\n            ingredient to successful health sector reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovak Republic - Health Sector\n            Modernization Support

The overarching objectives\n            are to: (a) improve fiscal discipline through structural\n            changes in the health sector, that will alleviate the\n            chronic problem of arrears in the sector, encourage greater\n            technical, and allocation efficiency, and institute a system\n            that will promote fiscal sustainability; (b) improve the\n            quality and cost-effectiveness of the health sector; and,\n            (c) mitigate any possible negative impacts on health care\n            access, especially for vulnerable populations.\n            Implementation of the reforms supported by HSMS SECAL would\n            contribute significantly to expenditure control in the short\n            term, and reductions in the medium term. However, risks\n            include weak expenditure management by health insurance\n            companies and hospitals, and excess hospital capacity. While\n            it is imperative that key legislation is passed, so that the\n            reform implementation have the appropriate legal support,\n            there is the likelihood of adverse outcomes due to reform\n            itself. Nevertheless, in the current context of already high\n            expenditures for health care, there is little realistic\n            opportunity to mobilize significant additional resources, to\n            balance expenditures and revenues. For the government\n            strategy to succeed, measures to mitigate risks include a\n            careful sequencing and phasing of the reforms, supported by\n            laws and regulations, including prudent financial\n            supervision, where regulations, and incentive structures\n            should be technically designed. Monitoring capacity of\n            access to health care, and private expenditures should be\n            established, including capacity building for key health\n            sector staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovak Republic -
