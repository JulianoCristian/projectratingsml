Lack of a verifying mechanism to confirm data\n            accuracy also created confusion at all levels. The data\n            source is not organized in a way to measure project impacts\n            and makes it difficult to extract useful data. The\n            counterpart agency should be more active in establishing a\n            good MIS at the early stage of project implementation. The\n            project should be provided with more technical assistance on\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) throughout project\n            implementation. The project design clearly recognized the\n            long-standing top-down planning and management approach at\n            the counterpart agencies. The design includes an alternative\n            mechanism to foster decentralization, but it did not\n            demonstrate a road map to scale up the project outcomes into\n            the government's system. The project's\n            decentralized approach faced a lot of criticism during\n            project preparation and it was already difficult for the\n            project preparation team to lay out a design to mainstream\n            the decentralized approach into national policy. The\n            Project's decentralized approach was accepted by the\n            government because it was a project to first demonstrate\n            success and then scale up on the basis of the results. Lack\n            of a design to scale up project outcomes at the national\n            level inhibits the counterpart agency from further\n            integration of project achievements into the government\n            system. When preparing a pilot project as this one, it is\n            important to conduct a careful analysis and design\n            concerning political circumstances, and include when and how\n            project outcomes will be integrated into national policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -
