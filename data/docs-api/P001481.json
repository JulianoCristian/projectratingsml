The Bank should have been able\n            to contribute to the improvement of project implementation\n            by greater insistence on the project unit's staff being\n            permanent and on better definitions of each member's\n            responsibilities. The project experienced substantial\n            delays. The reasons for this were partly\n            administrative/organizational such as insufficient\n            coordination among participating Government agencies, lack\n            of full-time staff in the PIU, and partly logistical--need\n            for site changes/modifications, and unavailability of\n            materials. Despite three closing date extensions two of the\n            five regional academic centers were not ready at the end of\n            the Implementation period, and textbook production had not\n            yet started. To strengthen the project's administrative\n            and management capacity, the Government should: define\n            exactly the authorities responsible with their\n            responsibilities and areas of action; define the\n            responsibilities and tasks of any future project unit, and\n            those of each member of its staff; supply the material,\n            financial and administrative means corresponding to the\n            tasks to be accomplished; recruit the competent full-time\n            staff needed to perform the project tasks; determine\n            beforehand the administrative channels and procedures to be\n            used for project implementation; give the project unit the\n            means needed to organize and control implementation in the provinces."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Second Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Second Education
