Some lessons learned includes: a global\n            template can enable rapid, good project design. Including\n            terms of reference for specific tasks and technical\n            specifications up front in the Operational Manual (OM) is\n            critical so as not to stall implementation of any emergency\n            project. As stated in all emergency equipment such as\n            protective gear and disinfectants for border points were\n            included in the project's OM, which helped to hasten\n            procurement and implementation. Projects formulated for a\n            specific disease can prove to have too narrow a Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) and, therefore, require\n            restructuring. The project was formulated specifically to\n            address Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), but some\n            of its outputs, such as, enhanced veterinary epidemiology\n            unit and intensive care unit, had from the outset wider\n            applications to other diseases. Decentralized task\n            management for supervision missions can be effective and\n            save costs. Utilization of country specialists based in\n            neighboring countries for project supervision in Kosovo\n            proved successful and represented cost savings when compared\n            with the alternative of bringing experts from another\n            continent. Close coordination with specialized UN agencies\n            can enhance the quality of technical assistance and produce\n            cost savings. UN agencies can extend Bank project outreach.\n            World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations\n            International Children's Fund (UNICEF) extended\n            outreach in Kosovo by assisting the project to access\n            communities in ethnic enclaves. The UN agencies had working\n            relations with ethnic minority community-based\n            organizations, broadcasters and decentralized health centers\n            and used these contacts to benefit project implementation.\n            Video conferencing can be an effective way to provide\n            regular implementation advice between bi-annual supervision\n            missions. This is a relatively inexpensive way of\n            maintaining a stream of advice and support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo - Avian Influenza Control and Human\n            Pandemic Preparedness and
