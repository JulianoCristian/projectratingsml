The key lessons suggest the need for project\n            design to include, not only components which would\n            complement the objectives of the project, but that the\n            specificity of these objectives, should be clearly defined.\n            Needless to say, project input, focussed at the regional\n            level, will have a greater impact if national programs\n            support regional integration. This further emphasizes the\n            need to ensure that project inputs be linked to the\n            macroeconomic reality; for, although the project succeeded\n            in training women in health care services - following\n            studies which conveyed a certain relentlessness in women\n            seeking health care (mainly due to the unavailability of\n            women health workers) - the fact remains, that recent women\n            graduates, have not been able to find employment with the\n            public sector. The weak records management, and, lack of\n            adequate monitoring and evaluation, indicates how important\n            management may prove for the success of an operation, since\n            the weak management procedures hindered implementation. An\n            effective monitoring and evaluation strategy should be\n            defined early on, during project preparation, and its\n            evaluation system in place, prior to
