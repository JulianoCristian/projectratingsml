Some lessons learned\n            included: the experience with the construction of the\n            Shiyan-Manchuanguan Expressway (SME) shows that resettlement\n            can have beneficial effects on living standard of the\n            affected people through the following measures, such as: (i)\n            effective leadership of provincial government; (ii)\n            efficient management and distribution of resettlement funds;\n            (iii) extensive public consultation throughout the entire\n            project and responsiveness to village issues and concerns;\n            (iv) effective procedures for receiving and addressing\n            complaints; and (v) dealing with complaints in a timely\n            manner. Among these, the public consultation was the key\n            factor. The public made useful suggestions on the expressway\n            alignment, the selection of centralized resettlement sites\n            prior to relocation, the allocation of housing lots at these\n            sites, land reclamation. From the start, specific objectives\n            were adopted, including minimizing resettlement impact,\n            saving cultivated land, creating new arable land, relocating\n            to more productive land, and restoring roads and irrigation\n            systems. The result was improvements in housing standards,\n            road access, drinking water, and the large majority of those\n            resettled expressing satisfaction with the process and their\n            new dwellings and location."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Hubei Shiman Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Hubei Shiman Highway

socioeconomic development of Hubei province by\n            enhancing its access to other provinces, particularly the\n            western region of China, improving local mobility within\n            poor, remote western parts of the province, and\n            strengthening governance of the provincial road sector. The\n            project has three components: (1) Highway capacity\n            investment: The project will finance the construction of the\n            105.1 km Hubei section of the Shiyan Manchuangan Expressway\n            (SME), a 106.8 km highway linking Shiyan City in\n            northwestern Hubei province to Manchuangan in Shaanxi\n            province. The project also includes a 6 km connecting road\n            in the Shiyan city area, six interchanges, one monitoring\n            center, one monitoring sub-center one service area, two rest\n            areas, two maintenance areas, and electrical and mechanical\n            equipment (E&M) for maintenance operations and\n            management. E&M equipment includes toll,\n            telecommunications, and traffic monitoring systems, and\n            safety and fire emergency facilities in tunnels.     (2)\n            Local Road Improvement Program (the LRIP):  The Local Road\n            Improvement Program (LRIP) addresses the lack of\n            accessibility in remote, low- income areas of Hubei\n            province. Under this program, the project will rehabilitate\n            and upgrade a series of low-class local roads in Shiyan\n            City.   (3) Institutional strengthening, policy development,\n            and road safety initiatives. These activities aim to\n            strengthen capacity of the Hubei Provincial Communications\n            Department (HPCD) to manage the provincial highway network\n            efficiently and improve the sustainability of provincial\n            highway sector financing. Expected improvements in the\n            quality of roads will lead to lower transport costs\n            throughout the province and lower life-cycle costs for road\n            maintenance. Adopting more efficient practices for managing\n            road will promote effective use of public funds, thereby\n            enhancing the contribution of the highway network to\n            economic development and its responsiveness to social needs.\n            Finally, road traffic safety initiatives will reduce\n            accident rates, thereby saving lives and addressing negative\n            road impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

Mitigation measures include restoring\n            irrigation facilities or providing compensation; removing\n            cultural relics during excavation for placement in a museum;\n            reinforcing building structures to withstand vibrations. To\n            control soil erosion avoid hill cutting, deep digging, or\n            high filling; build a drainage system and guard works\n            (temporary retaining wall and settling basins) to collect\n            run-off, plant fast-growing trees along access roads and\n            cover the road embankments with grass; restore topsoil\n            layer; and maintain a balance between borrowing and\n            depositing. To reduce noise, erect noise barriers (fences\n            and trees as buffers), schedule work for daytime, regulate\n            speed and ban horn blowing, prevent noisy equipment from\n            operating at night, and monitor noise volume.

Mitigation measures include restoring\n            irrigation facilities or providing compensation; removing\n            cultural relics during excavation for placement in a museum;\n            reinforcing building structures to withstand vibrations. To\n            control soil erosion avoid hill cutting, deep digging, or\n            high filling; build a drainage system and guard works\n            (temporary retaining wall and settling basins) to collect\n            run-off, plant fast-growing trees along access roads and\n            cover the road embankments with grass; restore topsoil\n            layer; and maintain a balance between borrowing and\n            depositing. To reduce noise, erect noise barriers (fences\n            and trees as buffers), schedule work for daytime, regulate\n            speed and ban horn blowing, prevent noisy equipment from\n            operating at night, and monitor noise volume. To minimize\n            impacts to water quality, construct wastewater treatment\n            facilities, separate oil from water and reuse wastewater or\n            treat wastewater in septic tank before discharging it into\n            irrigation system and keep harmful chemicals from riverside\n            and cover them with geo-textiles. To mitigate air pollution,\n            locate mixing stations away from sensitive areas, and plant\n            a greenbelt area to reduce increased nitrous oxide, water\n            unpaved ground as frequently as needed. Maintain landscape\n            coherence and compatibility. To avert impacts to water\n            quality caused by traffic accidents with vehicles\n            transporting hazardous materials, install drains and\n            crash-proof railing on bridges. Build temporary roads to\n            avoid traffic jams. To foster worker and public health and\n            safety, provide training about HIV and SARS, ensure drinking\n            water quality meets national standards, provide protective\n            gear (earplugs, helmets), improve management of explosives,\n            protect against poisonous snakes and epidemics, isolate\n            staff from SARS epidemic areas, and install traffic warning\n            signs and impose speed limits.
