Some important project lessons\n            learned were: (1) Teams should make sure that governments\n            and the GPE are aware of the implications choices made with\n            regards to options offered by the Bank. Retaining the same\n            number of classrooms in the project after the decision to\n            include taxes suggests that the government was not aware\n            that the amount of financing would not be increased to\n            include taxes. (2) Prepare communities properly if they are\n            to participate in school construction. Some of the schools\n            in the project were not completed because not all\n            communities were aware that they should provide the windows\n            and doors and finish the buildings and did not know details\n            related to their contribution. (3) Community based approach\n            to construction should be adopted in difficult to reach\n            areas. Construction of classrooms in some areas had to be\n            abandoned because contractors were unwilling to work in\n            these areas when the security situation had deteriorated.\n            (4) Limit project area coverage when resources are limited.\n            When project inputs are limited investments should be\n            concentrated in a limited area to reduce supervision costs.\n            (5) Addressing girls' education requires attention to\n            various constraints to their participation and the potential\n            impact of this new approach to promote girls\u0092 education\n            should be explored further. Advocacy for increasing\n            participation of girls in school should be combined with\n            other interventions which address the economic and security\n            issues which constrain access. The provision of cash prizes\n            to families with the best performing girls helped reduce\n            household costs and promote retention and should be further\n            studied. (6) Construction of latrines is not sufficient for\n            promoting girls' education. Provision of good\n            sanitation in school to increase girls' enrollment\n            should not be limited to provision of latrines but should be\n            part of a package that facilitates proper use and\n            maintenance of the latrines and an awareness program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Basic Education Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger -

improving access to better quality\n            education. In order to achieve this objective, the project\n            will focus on the following tree specific objectives: (i)\n            increase access and equity in primary education; (ii)\n            improve quality in primary education; and (iii) strengthen\n            the capacity of the Ministry of Education (MoE), and\n            decentralized entities. The original grant was in the amount\n            of US$8.0 million and approved on October 15, 2009. The\n            purpose of this extension request is to allow for completion\n            of (i) the construction program; and (ii) other ongoing\n            activities necessary to achieve Project objectives. The\n            extension is necessary to complete activities critical for\n            attaining the Project Development Objective (PDO) and for\n            improving access to and the quality of education in Niger\n            under implementation: (i) the construction of 314 classrooms\n            (including the construction of several latrine facilities\n            where necessary) and the corresponding acquisition of\n            classroom furniture (student desks and tables); and (ii) the\n            acquisition of 958,000 textbooks and 31,000 teacher guides\n            for grades 3-6. The implementation of these activities was\n            initially delayed due to weak procurement capacity and the\n            lack of the necessary key experts, but these issues have\n            been resolved and the implementation of these activities is\n            making good progress. The reallocation is necessary to\n            compensate for the higher than initially estimated costs of\n            the civil works activities, i.e. classroom construction. In\n            addition, while the execution of the construction program\n            was carried out in accordance which the grant agreement\n            which includes value added tax, the cost

- Education for All-Fast Track\n            Initiative Program Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Education for All-Fast Track\n            Initiative Program Project Objective is: to contribute to\n            the implementation of the Education Sector Program by\n            improving access to better quality primary education. In\n            order to achieve this objective, the project will focus on\n            the three components to: a) increase access and equity in\n            primary education; b) improve quality in primary education;\n            and c) strengthen capacity of the Ministry of Education\n            (MoE), and decentralized entities. The aim of the present\n            study is to evaluate the social and environmental\n            consequences of the second stage activities particularly\n            concerning the activities of the classroom building and the\n            setting up of the toilets and to define the measures of\n            attenuation, monitoring as well as the institutional\n            measures to be taken in order to eliminate or attenuate the\n            unfavourable environmental and social impacts. The extent of\n            the environmental and social measures required for the\n            project activities will depend on the results of the\n            selection process. This selection process aims to: (i)\n            determine the Basic Education Support Project (BESP) actions\n            susceptible  to get negative impacts at environmental and\n            social level, (ii) determine the adequate attenuation\n            measures for the activities having detrimental impacts,\n            (iii) identify the activities necessitating simple\n            attenuation measures or simplified environmental and social\n            impact study, (iv) describe  the institutional\n            responsibilities for the analysis and approval of the\n            selection results, the implementation of the suggested\n            attenuation measures and the preparation of the\n            environmental impact study , (v) ensure the monitoring of\n            the  environmental parameters during the project\n            implementation. The project will generally have positive\n            impacts concerning the access to a qualitative basic\n            education, at socio-economic plan and even at  biophysical\n            plan through the improvement of the primary schooling rate,\n            the reduction of the repeating rate, a better access to\n            school furniture, the capacity reinforcement of the teaching\n            staff and the Ministry of the national education, the\n            improvement of the school population welfare and the\n            environmental protection through the improvement of the\n            sanitation conditions and the maintenance works of the\n            facilities set up. Negative impacts of a weak to moderate\n            intensity will equally be observed during the building and\n            exploitation of the facilities (classrooms, toilets, etc.).\n            They include the degradation of sites and quarries, the\n            destruction of the ground cover, relative loss of\n            biodiversity, the pollution of the excavations left by the\n            quarries  especially during the rainy season, the erosion of\n            the borrowed sites, the site waste management, the social\n            conflicts related to the choice of the sites, the eventual\n            dislocation of the populations ; etc. but, most of these\n            negative impacts are attenuated with the implementation of\n            an environmental and social management plan (ESMP) which has\n            been developed in the framework of this study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cadre de gestion environnementale et sociale."},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cadre de gestion environnementale\n            et sociale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/06/10886499/niger-education-all-fast-track-initiative-program-project-environmental-assessment-cadre-de-gestion-environnementale-sociale","count":"Niger","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"cas, conservation, construction, curricula,\n            erosion, intervention, mars, pollution, potential impacts,\n            Poverty Reduction, project impacts, rainy season, recharge,\n            responsibilities, RESUME, social protection"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Niger - Projet d'appui a\n            l'education de base (PAEB) : cadre de gestion\n            environnementale et sociale"}},"projn":"NE-Niger - Niger Efa-Fti Basic Educ Project\n            -- P115436","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,m,Climate Change and Environment,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Telecommunications Infrastructure","teratopic":"Environment,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Water Resources","authors":{"authr":"Yaye, Gamatie Mariama"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20090729155014"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Primary education,Public administration- Education","theme":"Education for all,Gender","historic_topic":"Environment,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Water Resources","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","owner":"Education - East/Southern (AFTEE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"E2216"},"facets":{}}}
