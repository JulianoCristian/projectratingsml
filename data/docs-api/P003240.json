Major lessons o f general applicability are\n            conveyed as follows. When pressures to maintain a Client\n            current on the service of its external debt, have a major\n            impact on lending decisions, it is incumbent upon Management\n            to discuss these pressures, and any impact they had on the\n            timing, content, and size of a proposed operation with the\n            Board at the time of loan presentation. \"Stroke of the\n            pen\" measures are an unreliable indicator of Borrower\n            commitment to undertaking deeper structural reform. Uneven\n            macroeconomic performance sharply reduces the expected\n            long-term benefits of structural reform, and cripples the\n            prospects for private sector-led growth. Efforts to\n            diversify Zambia's production base have not succeeded,\n            in part because non-price constraints, such as poor\n            infrastructure, weak governance, and public sector\n            inefficiency, have not been adequately addressed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Economic Recovery and Investment\n            Promotion, Second Economic and Social Adjustment, and

as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, project sustainability\n            was uncertain, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: availability of technical assistance funds\n            can facilitate acquisition of critical technical expertise,\n            if task managers and government have flexibility in\n            allocating these funds to problem areas as they arise.\n            Adjustment programs are easier to implement and supervise as\n            well as more effective, if they have fewer, but more\n            critical conditions, fewer trenches and shorter disbursement\n            profiles. Recovery of the economy after stabilization can\n            take longer than expected, but should not be a reason for\n            despair. The Zambian case illustrates that stabilization,\n            coupled with vigorous structural adjustment will ultimately\n            produce positive results, provided the efforts can be\n            sustained. Continuity of task management is beneficial, as\n            is having the manager of the adjustment operation also\n            responsible for related technical assistance
