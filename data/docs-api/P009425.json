As a result of worldwide economic recession, a\n            decline in its international trade, and stagnation of\n            external aid inflows, Bangladesh has experienced severe\n            financial constraints over the past three years. While\n            Bangladesh has taken important steps to bring about\n            financial stability, continuing substantial aid inflows are\n            required to cushion the severity of the administrative\n            process and to allow a modest growth in investment and per\n            capita income. The credit, as a part of the Special Action\n            Program, will provide supplemental financing for four\n            ongoing projects to ensure that they are implemented in a\n            timely manner without the government having to diversify\n            resources from other high priority projects in its\n            development program credit will increase IDA's share of\n            project costs in two projects and finance a part of project\n            cost overruns in the remaining two. The credit will also\n            support the government's effort to address a number of\n            administrative and procedural issues which hinder efficient\n            project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Supplemental Assistance Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Supplemental\n            Assistance Credit
