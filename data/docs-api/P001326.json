The project achieved most of its objectives,\n            institutional development was partially achieved,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, the sustained impact of\n            policy and institutional changes, which are supported by\n            adjustment operations and capacity building programs, may\n            only become apparent in the long term and should be assessed\n            in that timeframe. Second, normal investment components\n            should not be packaged with adjustment operations. Third, a\n            monopoly public sector agency's future role in a\n            liberalized environment should be fully explored before the\n            liberalization process embarks on assisting that agency to\n            adjust to the liberalized environment. Fourth, performance\n            contracts between Governments and public sector agencies may\n            be useful tools to clarify mutual obligations. Fifth, when\n            the Government disengages from controlling the purchase and\n            distribution of commodities such as fertilizer, it does not\n            mean that it abrogates its regulatory oversight role. Sixth,\n            the design of technical assistance packages should not be\n            complex and ambiguous. Finally, inclusion of covenants must\n            receive more upfront thought during project design and\n            negotiations to ensure that covenants relate to critical\n            policy and institutional change issues and implementation actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Second Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Operation (ASAO II) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Second Agricultural\n            Sector Adjustment Operation (ASAO II) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/01/732020/kenya-second-agricultural-sector-adjustment-operation-asao-ii-project","projn":"KE-Ag.Sector Adjust.
