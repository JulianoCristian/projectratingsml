Project for\n            Honduras were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: more frequent training on\n            fiduciary procedures is needed for Project Management Unit\n            (PMU) staff in countries with known capacity constraints,\n            such as Honduras. Project design should consider these when\n            allocating funds to Project administration, and explore\n            alternatives for more efficient administration. Trainings\n            should not be limited to PMU staff, and should also include\n            line unit staff, with yearly refresher courses in light of\n            high turnover. Training should also include planning and\n            budgeting. Complicated projects with associated high risks\n            require intense supervision, ideally through a locally-based\n            Task Team Leader (TTL). Similarly, project design in these\n            contexts should remain simple and focused, with fewer\n            activities that are more clearly tied to fewer and narrower\n            objectives and outcomes. Donor coordination as seen in this\n            Project is highly beneficial to donors and beneficiaries\n            alike. The potential return of project funds is leveraged\n            through coordination, and activities can be taken to scale\n            to encompass more beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras -
