Some lessons learned included: the\n            fragmentation of a common position among the\n            Philippines' development partner institutions in\n            mid-2008 sent mixed messages about the best way forward in\n            the implementation of development policies. The use of a\n            common policy matrix is a useful instrument for policy\n            coordination, but can become overly constraining if managed\n            too rigidly. When adequate underpinnings are lacking for\n            certain measures at the time of appraisal, it is advisable\n            to defer those measures until they have been better\n            analyzed. The emphasis on the public dissemination of\n            information relating to public sector expenditures before an\n            adequate management information system is in place, meant\n            that the quality of the information that was disseminated\n            remained poor, undermining its usefulness. The DPL series\n            reflected a generalized tendency in the Bank to combine\n            macroeconomic, sectoral and social objectives into one DPL\n            series. The series will have been more manageable in both\n            the preparation and implementation stages with a narrower scope."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - First Development Policy Loan
