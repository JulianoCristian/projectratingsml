The project also allowed the Bank\n            to continue its policy dialogue with the Government of\n            Korea, and to support institutional development of MOHSA,\n            which had overall responsibility for the project. The\n            project concept was consistent with both Bank country\n            strategy and the specific requests of the Korean\n            authorities. Rapid growth, industrialization, and\n            urbanization had changed Korea's mortality profile and\n            shifted the disease burden to largely noncommunicable\n            diseases.Project outcome is satisfactory and its\n            achievements sustainable. The project achieved its stated\n            objectives: (a) it supported the regional distribution of\n            medical technologies in the eight medical regions; (b) the\n            project was successful in procuring and distributing\n            equipment to 81 hospitals maintaining a geographical balance\n            according to regional population density; and (c) equipment\n            was selected using an Equipment Selection Committee and was\n            purchased through the central Office of Supply, Republic of\n            Korea (OSROK) yielding better prices. In addition, the\n            project opened the way for a successor project which\n            addressed health sector policy issues in health care\n            financing and cost containment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea -
