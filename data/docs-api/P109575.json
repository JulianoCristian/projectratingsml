Schools, health centers, and roads suffered most of\n            the damage. From December 2007 to June 2011, World Bank\n            project successfully rehabilitated seventy one facilities\n            that felt the brunt of Hurricane Dean. The project design\n            combined reconstruction of affected education, health, and\n            roads facilities with capacity-building to strengthen local\n            and national capacity for disaster risk management. Simple\n            technologies such as hurricane straps in all the buildings,\n            safety or sanitation features within school facilities and\n            involvement of the local community through the creation of\n            local maintenance committees were emphasized in the\n            reconstruction of facilities. The project\u2019s design\n            incorporated measures to increase the sustainability of the\n            investments. The local committees prepared and implemented a\n            maintenance plan, promoted community awareness on the\n            importance of adequate maintenance of public assets, and\n            carried out measures to secure funding for maintenance\n            through fundraising"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rehabilitation of education, health and road\n            infrastructure in Jamaica after
