Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) During the financial crisis, dropout rates are\n            often low in primary school and transition to junior\n            secondary school is the most important attrition point in\n            the system, particularly for the poor; 2) During times of\n            financial crisis, or political change, projects should be\n            designed with a view toward maximum flexibility, and the\n            potential for rapid restructuring as the need arises; 3)\n            Within the framework of decentralization, the central\n            government (MONE) has a role in targeting strategies to\n            address the education needs of the poorest communities if\n            national goals for basic education are to be achieved; 4)\n            School rehabilitation using community participation method\n            costs an average of 25 percent less than the contractor\n            method, with at least similar quality; 5) While schools are\n            generally able to manage the block grant to purchase\n            learning input and materials, more assistance is required to\n            prepare them in organizing training; 6) Monitoring and\n            Evaluation Framework should be agreed during project\n            preparation which includes establishing the baseline data,\n            capacity building for district and province monitoring staff\n            and allocating sufficient resources for monitoring visits to\n            project beneficiaries; 7) School mapping can be useful to\n            education agencies at all levels; 8) The establishment of a\n            strongly staffed, and well managed central project\n            coordination unit (CPCU) must be considered a key\n            contributing factor to the successful implementation of any\n            project with widely disbursed operations; 9) Project\n            personnel from provincial and district agencies should\n            become more familiar with Bank guidelines and documentation\n            requirements; 10) When a project has widely disbursed\n            project sites, local administrators, coordinators and\n            teachers should be more fully briefed regarding the\n            advantages of participating in the project as well as their\n            responsibilities; and 11) Improving learning outcomes is a\n            complex task and it is best planned with the input from\n            local principals and teachers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Sumatra basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Sumatra basic\n            Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/7606401/indonesia-sumatra-basic-education-project","projn":"ID-Sumatra Basic Education Project -- P040196","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Primary Education,Education For All,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Education","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070515095021"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration,Secondary education,Primary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to books, achievement, active\n            learning, adults, BASIC EDUCATION, BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT,\n            block grants, civic engagement, civil service, classroom,\n            classroom furniture, community development, community\n            involvement, community involvement in education, community\n            participation, costs of education, curricula, curriculum,\n            Decentralization, decision making, District Education, early\n            grades, education enrollments, Education Finance, Education\n            for all, Education Law, Education Management, Education\n            Offices, education personnel, education planning, education\n            programs, Education Projects, Education Sector, education\n            services, education strategy, educational planning,\n            educators, employment, enrollment for boys, enrollment\n            rates, equal access, expenditures, external efficiency,\n            formative evaluations, girls, Human Development, human\n            resource development, instructional materials, Junior\n            secondary, junior secondary education, Junior secondary\n            school, junior secondary schools, learning environment,\n            learning materials, levels of education, Ministry of\n            Education, National Education, National Education Ministry,\n            NER, net enrollment, net enrollment rate, numeracy, papers,\n            pedagogy, Performance Indicators, primary education, Primary\n            school, primary school completion, primary school completion\n            rates, Primary Schools, private junior secondary, Private\n            School, private schools, Quality Assurance, quality of,\n            reading, remote schools, repetition, repetition rates, rural\n            areas, rural schools, Scholarships, school affairs, school\n            age, school age children, School Committees, school\n            construction, school establishment, School Improvement,\n            School Improvement Program, school level, school levels,\n            school libraries, school location, school maintenance,\n            school management, school mapping, school participation,\n            school principals, school projects, School Quality, School\n            rehabilitation, schooling, schools, Secondary Education,\n            Social Development, socialization, staff development,\n            student assessment, student learning, student learning\n            assessment, student scholarships, study tours, supplementary\n            reading, target schools, teacher, Teacher Certification,\n            Teacher Management, teacher shortages, Teacher Support,\n            teacher training, teacher training activities, teachers,\n            teaching, teaching aids, technical assistance, Tertiary\n            education, textbooks, tutors, workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF025521-PHRD-SOUTH SULAWESI/MALUKU\n            BASIC EDUC.
