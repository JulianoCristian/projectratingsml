The overall assessment of the project\n            design is unsatisfactory; the project suffered from being\n            too ambitious, and lacked adequate instruments to provide\n            monitoring and evaluation of project impact. Implementation\n            processes, quality targets, and long-term sustainability\n            concerns received insufficient attention. The project\n            components did not include measures or indicators to assess\n            actual impact or quality of implemented activities. Project\n            sustainability is uncertain. Having provided good support to\n            the project during preparation, implementation, and\n            follow-up, the overall rating for Bank performance is\n            satisfactory. Similarly, overall Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned stressed the synergies between\n            access to education and quality concerns, the importance of\n            monitoring and evaluation in developing teacher training and\n            professional programs, and support for teacher training,\n            securing financial sustainability, improving donor\n            coordination, preserving equity, and private sector
