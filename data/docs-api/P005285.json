The project objectives were: (i) to assist the\n            Government in developing an optimal investment plan for the\n            water sector; (ii) to develop water resources management and\n            conservation and water systems operation procedures; (iii)\n            to improve and extend water distribution and sewage\n            collection systems; (iv) to augment present efforts to\n            reduce unaccounted-for water; (v) to reduce groundwater\n            pollution by the collection and treatment of sewage; (vi) to\n            provide for recycling of treated effluents; and (vii) to\n            assist in the continuing development of the Water Authority.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (a) although the\n            Government has a stated intention to restructure public\n            sector institutions to improve efficiency, eliminate\n            subsidies, and increase participation by the private sector,\n            fundamental changes are likely to be needed in the\n            institutional and regulatory environment if these intentions\n            are to be realized; (b) it is also clearly a risk to rely on\n            the provision of technical assistance that is not directly\n            linked to the project; and (c) although a covenant might\n            appear to provide good leverage for ensuring financial and\n            institutional performance improvements, it appears unlikely\n            that non-compliance will result in suspension of disbursements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Water Supply and
