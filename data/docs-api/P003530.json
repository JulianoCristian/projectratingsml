A major development objective has been to increase\n            road transport capacity on the heavily trafficked segments\n            of national and provincial roads. Another has been to\n            gradually improve the road network and extend it into remote\n            areas. The project was implemented satisfactorily and as\n            planned, except for some design changes, which, overall, had\n            adverse impacts on the cost of the highway but had either\n            longer term operational advantages or the risk of traffic\n            capacity constraints, which, because of follow up actions,\n            has now been substantially reduced. The following lessons\n            are relevant to future Bank-financed highway projects in\n            China: 1) Design changes were needed under this project due\n            to inadequate location Studies; 2) Thorough contractor\n            assessments are needed in the prequalification process; 3)\n            Chinese and Bank costing procedures for civil works are\n            different, and agreeing to a common method would provide\n            more reliable and consistent cost and ERR estimates for\n            highway investments; and 4) The staff training program,\n            which incurred high person-month costs and had lower than\n            expected participation, highlighted the need for a thorough\n            review of training under Bank-financed highway projects.<BR>"},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shaanxi Provincial Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shaanxi Provincial\n            Highway
