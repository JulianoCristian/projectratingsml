In response to increasing demand for road transport\n            services arising from the accelerated development of the\n            economy during the early 1980s the Chinese Government\n            decided to accord high priority to increasing road transport\n            capacity in heavily trafficked corridors connecting major\n            cities and industrial centers in the various regions of the\n            country. Notwithstanding some of the deficiencies noted\n            during the implementation of the JQE, the two-year delay in\n            project completion and the significantly higher-than\n            envisaged overall cost, the project was completed\n            satisfactorily. The following lessons learned are relevant\n            to the still ongoing and future Bank Group-financed highway\n            projects: 1) The scope of the highway component of the\n            project lacked clear definition and consistency. Thus, the\n            project highway was not built according to a well-conceived\n            and well-defined concept; 2) The high rates of accidents on\n            recently built expressways also bring into question the\n            conventional notion that expressways are safer than the\n            arterial roads of the network; and 3) The two-year delay of\n            the completion of the project is partly attributable to the\n            fact that initially the project covered only the acquisition\n            of equipment associated with traffic monitoring,\n            telecommunications and tolling but not its installation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shandong Provincial Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shandong Provincial\n
