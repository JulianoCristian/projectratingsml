resource allocation,\n            increased private investment and exports, and greater\n            efficiency of the coffee sub-sector; (b) increasing public\n            savings and improving

orientation.\n            The measures to be supported by the proposed credit will\n            strengthen the ongoing policy reforms aimed at: (a)\n            strengthening incentives for efficient resource allocation,\n            increased private investment and exports, and greater\n            efficiency of the coffee sub-sector; (b) increasing public\n            savings and improving public expenditure management; (c)\n            reforming the public enterprise sector; and (d) improving\n            agricultural productivity and sector management. The\n            measures will also address new policy areas to accelerate\n            the supply response to the new market-oriented incentive\n            structure, notably; (e) liberalization of the labor market,\n            (f) deregulation of the financial sector; and (g)\n            preparation and implementation of targeted actions to\n            address pressing poverty issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Deuxieme programme\n            d'ajustment structurel"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi \u2013 Deuxi\u00e8me projet\n            d\u2019ajustement structurel : Burundi\u00a0- Deuxi\u00e8me Programme\n            d\u2019ajustement structurel"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/05/10819512/burundi-second-structural-adjustment-program-project-burundi-deuxieme-programme-dajustment-structurel","projn":"BI-Sal Ii-115476 -- P000207","subtopic":"Economic Stabilization,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"President's Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Burundi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20090715050256"},"subsc":"(Historic)Economic management","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural policy; Allocation of\n            resources; Capital markets; Economic growth; Employment\n            policy; Industrial policy; Private investments; Public\n            enterprises; Structural adjustment; Trade policy,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural policy; Allocation of\n            resources; Capital markets; Economic growth; Employment\n            policy; Industrial policy; Private investments; Public\n            enterprises; Structural adjustment; Trade policy,,"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P4770","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Deuxieme programme d'ajustment\n            structurel - Burundi"}}},"facets":{}}}
