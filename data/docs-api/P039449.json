Overall\n            World Bank and Borrower performances were rated marginally\n            satisfactory. These are some of the lessons learned: In\n            complex project designs, think through clearly priorities\n            and the sequencing of actions and build in implementation\n            flexibility--some project components will always advance\n            quickly and others will lag. When policy reforms are subject\n            to reversals and when elections will be held in the near\n            future, hold discussions with leaders of the sector in\n            opposition political parties. Include political experts on\n            preparation teams to provide guidance on minimizing the risk\n            of policy reversal and to advise on how best to appeal to\n            the interests of stakeholders and political actors who may\n            oppose or potentially oppose reforms. When a project expects\n            to significantly change behaviors and the rules of the game,\n            include institutional experts on preparation teams to advise\n            on strategies and priorities for doing so. When planning\n            large scale civil works in a country where the Bank lacks\n            much experience, engage local experts to lay out all the\n            steps, estimate the time involved with each, and advise on\n            how to reduce time. For complicated procurement, involve a\n            regional procurement adviser in an early mission to\n            participate in the solution of technical issues and to\n            emphasize to the Government the importance of procurement expertise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Higher Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Hungary - Higher Education Reform

- Higher Education Reform Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Higher Education Reform Project aims\n            at developing a system of higher education that: a) responds\n            to the nation's changed and changing social and\n            economic needs; b) operates efficiently; and c) mobilizes\n            greater private finance and distributes the costs of\n            education more equitably. There are six components in this\n            project. First, Policy and Institutional Development will\n            support the introduction and strengthening of key policy and\n            administrative reforms in allocation of students and\n            finance; administration of higher education; teaching\n            programs; tuition charges and student loans; and private\n            higher education. Second, Higher Education Institutes\n            Investment Program will reduce costs by consolidating\n            single-purpose institutions into multi-faculty colleges and\n            universities. Third, Management Information System will\n            finance development of strategy and process redesign;\n            software development; upgrading of information technology\n            networks; and training. Fourth, Management Capacity\n            Development will support increased management capacity in\n            planning, financial management, information systems,\n            academic reform, and policy analysis. Fifth, Student Loan\n            Program will develop a loan program based on a state\n            guarantee of repayment. Sixth, Project Management and\n            Project Preparation Facility will finance the establishment\n            and operation of the Project Management Unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Higher Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Hungary - Higher Education Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/01/693774/hungary-higher-education-reform-project","projn":"HU-Higher Educ -- P039449","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Hungary","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980312102327"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-1","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"academic achievement,academic\n            performance,academic staff,Accreditation,addition,additional\n            funds,age group,attending school,Basic\n            education,canteens,chemistry,Class size,class\n            sizes,colleges,decision making,education budget,education\n            finance,Education Institutions,Education Policy,education\n            system,educational opportunities,effective\n            implementation,employment,engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            levels,families,fields of study,foundation courses,health\n            services,Higher Education Reform,Human\n            Development,Institutional\n            Development,instruction,instructors,isolation,labor\n            force,labor market,laboratory instruction,language\n            proficiency,languages,Laws,learning,libraries,life long\n            learning,managers,marketing,mathematics,natural\n            sciences,occupations,parents,primary education,Private\n            Education,problem solving\n            skills,professors,proficiency,public expenditure,public\n            institutions,public participation,public\n            sector,retirement,scholarships,schooling,secondary\n            education,social sciences,stipends,student choice,student\n            enrollments,student loans,student organizations,student\n            places,teachers,teaching,teaching staff,tertiary\n            education,training programs,Tuition\n            fees,universities,workers,working conditions,youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"academic achievement,academic\n            performance,academic staff,Accreditation,addition,additional\n            funds,age group,attending school,Basic\n            education,canteens,chemistry,Class size,class\n            sizes,colleges,decision making,education budget,education\n            finance,Education Institutions,Education Policy,education\n            system,educational opportunities,effective\n            implementation,employment,engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            levels,families,fields of study,foundation courses,health\n            services,Higher Education Reform,Human\n            Development,Institutional\n            Development,instruction,instructors,isolation,labor\n            force,labor market,laboratory instruction,language\n            proficiency,languages,Laws,learning,libraries,life long\n            learning,managers,marketing,mathematics,natural\n            sciences,occupations,parents,primary education,Private\n            Education,problem solving\n            skills,professors,proficiency,public expenditure,public\n            institutions,public participation,public\n            sector,retirement,scholarships,schooling,secondary\n            education,social sciences,stipends,student choice,student\n            enrollments,student loans,student organizations,student\n            places,teachers,teaching,teaching staff,tertiary\n            education,training programs,Tuition\n            fees,universities,workers,working conditions,youth"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF029675-PHRD-HIGHER EDUCATION PROJECT","repnb":"16536"},"facets":{}}}
