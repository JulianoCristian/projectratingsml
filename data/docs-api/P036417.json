Its success under difficult conditions during\n            a period of economic transition can be attributed to: a\n            highly committed and dedicated implementing agency at the\n            national level; Poverty Alleviation Program Office's\n            and local government's capacity to learn from\n            experience; the use of an existing network of local\n            government institutions aimag and sum level as a delivery\n            mechanism; the introduction of a bottom-up approach to\n            project identification and implementation; the trust placed\n            in local government's capacity to identify, contract,\n            supervise, and report on public works schemes and basis\n            education and rural health projects; the cross-sectoral\n            approach that allowed districts a choice between health,\n            education, public works and income generating credits; and\n            the emphasis on making certain that funding was in place for\n            operation & maintenance of whatever structure and\n            services were rehabilitated by the project. Some important\n            lessons include: Successful implementation of a bottom-up,\n            demand-driven approach is facilitated by open public\n            meetings at grassroots level. The establishment of a\n            cross-sectoral implementing agency facilitates poverty\n            project implementation but creates conflicts and\n            uncertainty. Sustainable access to credit for the poor\n            requires the creation of a rural finance system. A\n            diversified menu of activities is needed for reaching the poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Poverty Alleviation for\n            Vulnerable Groups
