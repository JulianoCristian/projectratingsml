Hence, it is cost-effective to refine\n            engineering designs, of both for the expressway, and the\n            electrical, and mechanical systems (EMS) component.\n            Similarly, procurement of EMS works should start at least\n            two years before completion of civil works; 2) while the\n            Trucking Study identified the barriers to long-distance\n            traffic, and recommended long-distance trade facilitation,\n            the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) enhanced\n            inter-provincial cooperation, key lessons the Bank undertook\n            for promoting trade, initiating a series of national highway\n            projects, by grouping provinces traversed by a long section\n            of the NTHS; 3) both the Northwest Henan roads, and the road\n            improvement program components achieved significant benefits\n            under the rural roads programs, including community\n            appreciation for this type of involvement, a lesson\n            confirmed by the success of the road improvement for poverty\n            alleviation component in the follow-up project, and its\n            effectiveness in targeting poverty."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Henan Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Henan Highway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/12/828345/china-henan-highway-project","projn":"CN-Henan Prov.
