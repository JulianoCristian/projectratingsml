Despite many shortcomings, the outcome of\n            the SAL was satisfactory. The economy was extensively\n            liberalized. A basic legal and institutional framework for a\n            market economy was established. Implementation of the\n            project was satisfactory. The performance of the borrower\n            was adequate, especially given the political changes. The\n            performance of the Bank was also satisfactory. The SAL was\n            approved very early in Bulgaria's political and\n            economic transition. Much needed to be done. Market\n            institutions and laws did not exist. Thus, it is inevitable\n            that some measures supported by the SAL were inappropriate\n            to achieve the desired objective or were too ambitious. Most\n            measures, however, have yielded important and tangible\n            benefits in moving the economy towards one increasingly\n            guided by the private sector, while introducing a measure of\n            macroeconomic stability. At the same time, project\n            sustainability could be at risk, due to the insufficient\n            progress on structural reforms (especially privatization,\n            public finances and social safety net). Further substantial\n            intensification and broadening of structural reforms is,\n            therefore, necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Structural Adjustment

incentive framework, creation of a modern\n            banking system reform and the privatization of state owned\n            assets; (iii) state enterprise (SE) restructuring and energy\n
