Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) the project included both specific investments\n            and policy issues, such as enactment of the petroleum law,\n            energy sector reforms and establishment of a conducive\n            regulatory environment to attract private operators in the\n            generation and distribution areas. The project covered a\n            menu of options aimed at long term sector reliability,\n            efficiency and sustainability, though the available\n            financing could not support all the required interventions\n            apart from maintaining a strong dialogue with the respective\n            stakeholders; 2) privatization of power generation and\n            distribution does not necessarily provide quick remedies in\n            terms of ensuring efficient operations of the power sector\n            and improved quality of supply and access, as demonstrated\n            by the difficulties in reducing distribution losses in\n            Uganda. However, over time a financially viable generation\n            and distribution business will help to mitigate the\n            perceived risks of future private investors; 3) water\n            resources management and energy planning and development in\n            the Lake Victoria Basin need to be integrated on the basis\n            of a shared vision plan; and 4) the project design contained\n            a number of very specific performance indicators. Some of\n            the indicators such as reducing load shedding and loss\n            reduction, were beyond the control of the project hence\n            cannot be easily used to evaluate the project performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Fourth Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Fourth Power

Project, a project to\n            strengthen the Owen Falls dam and hydroelectric plant, are\n            embedded in the concrete works of the generating units,\n            there will be no negative environmental impacts such as\n            mosquito breeding. The water hyacinth is currently under\n            control and three trash booms have been installed. The\n            environmental monitoring plan proposes to monitor the\n            potential resurgence of the water hyacinth and will use\n            mechanical harvesting when needed and monitors the quantity\n            of surface water at points downstream, water content and\n            quality, vegetation samples, the biology and ecology of the\n            fish population, the stability of the shoreline, and silt\n            removal from storm drains. Since this project will take over\n            the temporary infrastructure used for construction under the\n            Third Power Project (Report no. 9153), any negative\n            environmental impacts due to demobilizing and re-mobilizing\n            construction contractors to the site will be eliminated and\n            the risks associated with construction and rehabilitation\n            minimized. A de-commissioning plan will ensure safe removal\n            of the temporary infrastructure and a return of the project\n            area to its original state after construction activities\n            end. An environmental audit will assess the extent of\n            environmental liabilities and identify potential social\n            impacts, propose appropriate costed remediation measures as\n            well as effective arrangements for implementing the\n            remediation plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental impact assessment -\n            rehabilitation of specific Umeme -
