Lessons learned include: the design has\n            benefited from the guidance provided by Operations Policy\n            and Country Services (OPCS), lessons from the first EGRG and\n            other development policy operations in post-conflict\n            countries (notably in Togo and Liberia). The importance of\n            careful risk analysis which takes into account the political\n            and social dimensions, identifying and weighing the relative\n            importance of special interests. This is especially\n            important in the case of fragile transitional coalitions.\n            Given the difficulty of getting a consensus on difficult\n            issues, it is essential to limit the focus of reform to key\n            functions of the Government (public finance management) and\n            to sectors vital to economic recovery and growth (energy,\n            cocoa, and the financial sector) and on policy measures\n            which 'open the door' to a deepening of reform.\n            Once reform has found its footing, it is important not to\n            slow momentum but rather deepen the reform, rather than\n            broadening the scope (which risks over-loading decision\n            makers' focus and span of control while stretching\n            high-level human resources). In a fluid, post-conflict\n            environment, an important criterion for selecting policy\n            measures is the likely impact on public confidence, notably\n            by improving governance and transparency and communicating\n            results effectively to the public, as well as informing\n            other key factors such as external private investors. It is\n            also important to complement and balance broad\n            poverty-oriented measures with parallel steps to increase\n            private sector confidence. The EGRG II disbursement\n            supported a program of domestic debt arrears clearance which\n            first helped small businesses weather the economic recession\n            before moving on to address larger claims on the basis of\n            their seniority. The process was transparent, with\n            consultation of the creditors and publication of\n            settlements. These steps did much to restore the private\n            sector's faith in the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Second Economic\n            Governance and Recovery Grant
