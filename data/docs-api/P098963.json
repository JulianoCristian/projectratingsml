Some lessons\n            learned included: design of the budget supports needs to be\n            adapted to the institutional environment. In a weak\n            institutional environment such as Niger, it is better to\n            avoid a long list of prior actions, and focus instead on a\n            short list of key actions and their cross-sectoral linkages\n            and synergies. It is important to provide a medium-term\n            perspective, particularly when addressing policy constraints\n            in sectors, where results are not achieved in the\n            short-term. In that respect, the decision to discontinue the\n            series of three rural and social policy reform operations\n            and move to other sectors before gains in the initial\n            sectors are fully consolidated is perplexing. This decision\n            may give the Government the wrong signal that pursuing the\n            reforms in the human development area is no longer needed.\n            The Development Policy Lending (DPL) series demonstrated\n            that satisfactory outcomes can be achieved with strong\n            commitment on the part of government and with Bank support\n            designed to develop the needed capacity for implementation.\n            This is particularly evident in the education, health, and\n            to a lesser extent in agriculture sectors, where authorities\n            are committed to improve capacities and increase efficiency\n            of service delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - First and Second Rural and Social\n            Policy Credit/Grant

  continue supporting the Republic of Niger in implementing\n            its program to promote growth and achieve a sustainable\n            reduction of poverty. The RSRC-2 is part of a series of\n            development policy lending operations and follows the first\n            rural and social policy reform credit approved in June 13,\n            2006. The RSRC-2 focuses on overcoming policy constraints\n            and institutional bottlenecks in public sector management,\n            agricultural and rural development, and human development\n            (including demographic growth and gender issues). The\n            specific results that the RSRC series (1 and 2) are trying\n            to achieve are to: (i) accelerate the implementation of\n            reforms in public expenditure management and related\n            fiduciary systems, essential for the success of Niger's\n            broader reform agenda; (ii) promote rural growth through\n            implementing rural medium-term expenditure framework,\n            supporting the decentralization of land administration,\n            increasing the contribution of irrigation to agricultural\n            GDP, and improving the efficiency of existing food security\n            policies; and (iii) improve the efficiency of spending and\n            human resource management, and effectiveness of service\n            delivery in basic education and health sectors, while also\n            tackling the challenge of rapid population growth and\n            women's rights. The first tranche of RSRC-2, was\n            disbursed in August 2007. The conditions of release of the\n            second tranche as listed in the financing agreement that\n            have been met are as follows: (i) the progress achieved by\n            the recipient in carrying out the program is satisfactory;\n            (ii) the macroeconomic framework of the recipient is\n            appropriate; and (iii) eleven prior actions have been\n            carried out in material respects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Second Rural and Social Policy\n            Reform Grant"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Second Rural and Social\n

delivery to the\n            poor and in implementing reforms in public sector management\n            to secure adequate financing in critical sectors of the\n            economy. This RSRC-2 is a one-year budget support operation\n            to be disbursed in two tranches. It will address policy and\n            institutional bottlenecks in public sector management, as\n            well as rural and human development, where it is closely\n            linked to ongoing investment operations. Within a\n            medium-term framework, and building on the previous budget\n            support operation (RSRC-1) as well as ongoing projects in\n            agriculture, education, health, and population (upcoming),\n            this two tranche operation will continue focusing on\n            overcoming policy constraints and institutional bottlenecks\n            in: (i) public sector management; (ii) agricultural growth\n            and rural development; and (iii) human development,\n            including demographic growth and gender issues. The RSRCs\n            have been built around a medium-term results framework which\n            has identified the proposed reforms in the rural and human\n            development areas, as well as subsequent steps to further\n            support the growth agenda. This approach is aligned with the\n            Government's strategy, reflected in the Second Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper, which identifies agriculture as\n            the engine of growth of the economy, in the short-and medium-term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Second Rural and Social Policy\n            Reform Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Second
