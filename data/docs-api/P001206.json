The project achieved its central\n            objectives, institutional development has been partially\n            achieved, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            the Bank was highly satisfactory while the Borrower's\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the project demonstrated that extensive\n            collaboration between the Bank staff, Borrower, and private\n            sector helps define project components through consensus and\n            increases Borrower internalization. Second, the project has\n            illustrated the virtues of Bank Group flexibility in\n            specific circumstances. Third, private sector development is\n            an inevitably slow process that requires considerable time\n            before reforms can be expected to generate a supply\n            response. Fourth, more effort should be invested in\n            educating the Borrowers about the auditing requirements that\n            accompany Bank financing. Finally, concise conditionality,\n            simplicity of design, and a strong central theme are not\n            necessarily incompatible with a complex project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire
