Lessons from the project\n            experience suggest the following. Improving the quality of\n            basic education, requires strong, and sustained commitment\n            from the top levels of the state administration, as well as\n            substantial financial resources on a continuous basis.\n            However, substantial efforts must be placed in the prior\n            establishment of an institutional framework, in monitoring\n            and evaluation systems, and in the evaluation of schools\n            administration. Furthermore, decentralization of primary\n            education to municipal levels, does not automatically\n            promote better quality; a proactive monitoring performance\n            by the state, of the municipal administrations, and schools\n            is needed, as well as offering specially designed programs\n            in support of the school system. Similarly, regular\n            quantitative assessment of student learning is essential,\n            both to evaluate educational policies, and for self\n            evaluation of schools. In looking at in-service training, it\n            is most useful when focused on pedagogical aspects, i.e.,\n            integrating pedagogic training with subject matter training\n            is most advisable. As for the development, and\n            implementation of a good educational information system, it\n            is essential to provide feedback to decision makers at all
