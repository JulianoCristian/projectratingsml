The project\n            achieved its specific objectives, its impact has been\n            significant, sustainability is uncertain at this time, and\n            both the Bank and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, for a\n            bi-national project, more binding bi-national arrangements,\n            in which both countries borrow and are obligated to IDA,\n            should be considered. Second, the complex institutional,\n            financial, and macroeconomic aspects of the KMP development\n            should have been part of the feasibility study. Third, a\n            contracting philosophy of a client/consultant relationship,\n            as opposed to an owner/contractor relationship, should be\n            adopted for studies where terms of reference and scope may\n            change during contract execution. Fourth, to facilitate good\n            working relationships, the compensation package for\n            counterpart personnel provided to the consultant should not\n            be too different from that of the local labor market from\n            which the consultant may hire local consultants. Lastly,\n            when IDA supports preparation of a bi-national project,\n            arrangements need to be made to insure that IDA has an\n            effective dialogue with both countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - The Karnali Preparation (Phase I) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - The Karnali Preparation\n            (Phase I) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/08/736417/nepal-karnali-preparation-phase-project","projn":"NP-Karnali Preparation -- P010197","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Research,Teaching and Learning,Educational Sciences,Airports and Air Services,TF054599-PHRD-KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: WATER\n            MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925204520"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access roads,adjustment,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,airport facilities,binding,Canadian\n            International Development Agency,CIDA,civil\n            works,consensus,consortia,construction,consumers,decision-making\n            process,design,detailed engineering,drainage,environmental\n            impact,equipment procurement,export,feasibility,fuel,fuel\n            cost,goal,handling,Hydroelectric\n            Project,Identity,institutional\n            framework,intermediary,irrigation,Learning,mobilization,navigation,negotiations,operation\n            and maintenance,Preparation,Project Design,Project\n            Implementation,range,Reference,Regional\n            Office,Reserve,River,river basins,runway,total\n            energy,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations Development\n            Programme,Upper,Water Resources"},"1":{"cdata!":"access roads,adjustment,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,airport facilities,binding,Canadian\n            International Development Agency,CIDA,civil\n            works,consensus,consortia,construction,consumers,decision-making\n            process,design,detailed engineering,drainage,environmental\n            impact,equipment procurement,export,feasibility,fuel,fuel\n            cost,goal,handling,Hydroelectric\n            Project,Identity,institutional\n            framework,intermediary,irrigation,Learning,mobilization,navigation,negotiations,operation\n            and maintenance,Preparation,Project Design,Project\n            Implementation,range,Reference,Regional\n            Office,Reserve,River,river basins,runway,total\n            energy,UNDP,United Nations,United Nations Development\n            Programme,Upper,Water Resources"}},"owner":"SAS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"11013"},"722848":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/03/722848/nepal-karnali-preparation-phase-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/03/722848/nepal-karnali-preparation-phase-project","new_url":"1984/03/722848/nepal-karnali-preparation-phase-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/09/000178830_98101902435340/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/09/000178830_98101902435340/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1452","docdt":"1984-03-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2000-02-09T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - The Karnali Preparation (Phase I) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objectives of the proposed\n            project would be to assess the economic justification and\n            technical viability of the Karnali (Chisapani) Multipurpose\n            Project on the Karnali River in Nepal.
