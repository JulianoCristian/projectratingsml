First,\n            high quality and timely training of project functionaries is\n            a sine qua non for high quality service delivery. Second,\n            there is a need for an increased emphasis on the health and\n            care-related factors determining nutrition outcomes in the\n            youngest children. Third, operational research needs to\n            focus on a reduced number of high quality, carefully\n            conducted, and punctually reported studies to be carried out\n            within the first two to three years of the project, so that\n            findings can be used to improve the project. Fourth, more\n            importance needs to be attached to monitoring, with respect\n            to quality in general, and the need to more visibly track\n            progress towards the impact objectives in particular.\n            Finally, the project demonstrated clearly that the rapid\n            expansion of ICDS into new blocks usually comes at the\n            expense of service quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Integrated Child Development\n            Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Integrated Child\n            Development Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/04/731725/india-integrated-child-development-services-project","projn":"IN-Icds I (Oris & Andhr -- P010361","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Health Economics & Finance,Primary Education,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980624142952"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adolescents,antenatal\n            care,beneficiaries,child care,Child Development,child\n            feeding,child growth,child malnutrition,child\n            morbidity,child nutrition,Child nutritional status,Child\n            Survival,community involvement,curriculum,development\n            indicators,folic acid,food supplementation,girls,health\n            care,health education,health messages,health services,health\n            status,ICR,immunization,impact indicators,IMPLEMENTATION\n            COMPLETION REPORT,Income,Infant Mortality,institutional\n            capacity,iron,LBW,Learning,literacy,live\n            births,malnutrition,maternal nutrition,media,Monitoring\n            data,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,Nutrition,nutrition\n            interventions,Nutrition Monitoring,nutrition\n            outcomes,nutritional status,old children,outcome\n            indicators,participatory rural\n            appraisal,PMU,posters,pre-school\n            education,pregnancy,pregnant women,Primary Education,process\n            indicators,programs,Project Management,Project Management\n            Unit,Project Objectives,quality control,Rural Areas,Safe\n            Motherhood,Service delivery,Service Quality,severe,Social\n            development,Social indicators,targeting,terminal\n            evaluation,tetanus,vitamin A,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"adolescents,antenatal\n            care,beneficiaries,child care,Child Development,child\n            feeding,child growth,child malnutrition,child\n            morbidity,child nutrition,Child nutritional status,Child\n            Survival,community involvement,curriculum,development\n            indicators,folic acid,food supplementation,girls,health\n            care,health education,health messages,health services,health\n            status,ICR,immunization,impact indicators,IMPLEMENTATION\n            COMPLETION REPORT,Income,Infant Mortality,institutional\n            capacity,iron,LBW,Learning,literacy,live\n            births,malnutrition,maternal nutrition,media,Monitoring\n            data,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,Nutrition,nutrition\n            interventions,Nutrition Monitoring,nutrition\n            outcomes,nutritional status,old children,outcome\n            indicators,participatory rural\n            appraisal,PMU,posters,pre-school\n            education,pregnancy,pregnant women,Primary Education,process\n            indicators,programs,Project Management,Project Management\n            Unit,Project Objectives,quality control,Rural Areas,Safe\n            Motherhood,Service delivery,Service Quality,severe,Social\n            development,Social indicators,targeting,terminal\n            evaluation,tetanus,vitamin A,workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
