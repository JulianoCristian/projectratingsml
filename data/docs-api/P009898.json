It is part of a long-term program\n            to irrigate one million hectares in Karnataka\u0092s arid\n            northern districts which started in 1956. Intended to extend\n            irrigation downstream and continue construction of Almatti\n            Dam for additional storage of irrigation water, in\n            accordance with projected irrigation needs, while completing\n            the resettlement of families displaced by Narayanpur and\n            Almatti and the irrigation network. The project was rated\n            unsatisfactory and had satisfactory performances by the Bank\n            and borrower. Lessons learned where that economic\n            rehabilitation plans should be taken into account when\n            establishing Resettlement Centers. The time frame required\n            for economic rehabilitation is much greater than that for\n            physical resettlement and the resettlement process will need\n            support and careful monitoring until this is completed.\n            Resettlement cannot be implemented with a blueprint\n            approach. Project design has to allow a flexible, process\n            approach aimed at achieving resettlement objectives rather\n            than delivering predetermined inputs. The cost of not\n            leaving irrigated land as planned and of not building the\n            drains where needed will be vary high compared to the modest\n            costs avoided. Leaving the canals open and allowing\n            over-irrigation when there is surplus water during the\n            initial construction period encourages high-water consuming\n            crops and risks waterlogging and salinization. Finally, the\n            absence of the sector work and formulation of a coherent\n            irrigation sector strategy left the project\n            conceptualization vulnerable despite intensive preparation\n            and appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
