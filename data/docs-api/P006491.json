It had\n            three major objectives: (a) to assist state and municipal\n            authorities in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro in\n            urgent reconstruction and rehabilitation made necessary by\n            the floods and landslides;( b) to implement essential\n            physical works designed to minimize and prevent future flood\n            damage; and (c) to assist state and municipal authorities in\n            developing a program and the institutional capacity to cope\n            better with future emergencies. The project included\n            reconstruction components such as repair of roads and\n            bridges, repair and rehabilitation of public buildings\n            damaged, and the provision of minimally serviced sites for\n            families whose homes were destroyed during the floods and\n            landslides. Except for repair of buildings (which had\n            already been reconstructed by the time funds became\n            available), implementation of the above components was\n
