Some lessons\n            learned included: actively engaging provincial and local\n            government in the sub-project selection process at the\n            provincial level is a good way to ensure that the\n            sub-projects funded are considered priorities by both the\n            beneficiary community and the relevant sector ministries and\n            local government. This in turn helps to ensure that\n            completed sub-projects are staffed and equipped by\n            complementary government financing. Likewise, the national\n            government must be required to make a match investment in\n            the Social Fund, either by contributing public sector\n            resources or by engaging with other donor or private sector\n            companies to raise additional Social Fund capital. The lack\n            of national government contributions undermines the\n            long-term sustainability of the social fund, increasing the\n            likelihood that it will cease to exist once World Bank\n            funding ends. The DRC context requires investments in\n            project management costs that exceed the Bank's\n            standard ceiling of 20 percent of total budget costs. This\n            will help project implementation units be better equipped to\n            effectively support operations over a vast territory, where\n            transport facilities are often expensive and precarious.\n            Adequate funding needs to be allocated to monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E). Project indicators need to be very\n            clearly defined, and project staff and partners need to be\n            trained in a common methodology for gathering, recording,\n            and documenting indicator data. To do this effectively,\n            provincial offices need to have M&E specialists on\n            staff. Data audits, carried out by an internal or third\n            party auditor, are as important as financial audits in\n            verifying that a project is on track in achieving project\n            results transparently."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -

The extension is\n            necessary to compensate for some of the implementation delay\n            caused by a World Bank request to change disbursement\n            procedures (after six months, disbursement procedures were\n            reverted to the original ones). In particular, the extension\n            will make it possible to finalize the implementation of 175\n            sub-projects, of which 125 financed by the first additional\n            financing and 50 by the second additional financing. This\n            will bring the total number of sub-projects completed under\n            the first additional financing to 327 and the total number\n            of sub-projects financed under the second additional\n            financing to 58, equivalent to a disbursement of about USD\n            10 million."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Additional Financing for the Emergency Social Action Project\n            : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/12/17097783/congo-democratic-republic-additional-financing-emergency-social-action-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"ZR-Democratic Republic Of Congo Emergency\n            Social Action Project -- P086874","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20121220054604"},"theme":"Gender,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Other social protection and risk management,Improving labor markets","subsc":"Health,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways,Primary education,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Transportation,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to market, Accountability,\n            accountant, accounting, Accounting procedures, auditing,\n            audits, bank account, bank accounts, Bank Borrowers, Bank\n            financing, Bank management, Bank policies, banks,\n            beneficiaries, beneficiary, bid, Borrower, bribes,\n            Budgeting, Capacity building, CAPITALS, cash balance,\n            CITIES, clinics, commercial bank, commercial banks,\n            commodity prices, communities, community participation,\n            Competitive Bidding, consolidation, Corruption, Credits,\n            CURRENCY, Debt, Debt Relief, description, direct payments,\n            Disbursement, disbursement arrangements, disbursement\n            method, Disbursement methods, disbursement of funds,\n            disbursements, durable, economic activities, economic\n            growth, economic reform, employment, enrollment, equipment,\n            Exchange Rate, expenditures, External Auditors, financial\n            crisis, financial institutions, Financial Management,\n            financial management arrangement, Financial management\n            arrangements, Financial Management requirements, financial\n            management system, Financial Reporting, financial\n            statements, financings, Fraud, Funds Flow, Governance\n            issues, housing, ID, Information System, initial deposit,\n            institutional arrangements, institutional capacity, internal\n            audit, Interventions, Investment Loan, judgment, labor\n            force, legal framework, Lending Instrument, leverage,\n            libraries, living conditions, Loan, macroeconomic stability,\n            mismanagement, money transfer, negotiations, new legal\n            framework, Operating Costs, portfolio, Procurement,\n            procurement law, Procurement plan, procurement procedures,\n            public funds, Resettlement, Risk factors, safety, safety\n            net, scholarships, social capital, social cohesion, Social\n            Fund, Social safety nets, social services, Street Children,\n            Subsidiary, TOWNS, transaction, transparency, Trust Fund,\n            unemployment, urban services, Vulnerable Children, withdrawal"}},"owner":"Social Protection -
