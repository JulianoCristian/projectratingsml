Some lessons learned includes:\n            adoption and funding by the government: a popular and robust\n            series of Bank-led projects with demonstrated success in\n            rural poverty reduction and improved governance, can lead to\n            a massive national program led and largely funded by the\n            Government. It can also mobilize significantly increased\n            counterpart funding, at national and local levels, to\n            achieve country-wide coverage. The use of a Multi donor\n            Trust Fund improved implementation and successful\n            experimentation: a successful series of projects, thoroughly\n            evaluated, documented and publicized, can attract bilateral\n            donors through linked trust funds and parallel financing\n            operations. Rapid and large scaling up of a program's\n            operation can exceed institutional capacity: in Program\n            Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM)-rural first and\n            second, the major expansion of the scope and scale of the\n            project following its adoption as a national program, put\n            severe stress on the institutional capacities at the\n            national level, especially Directorate General of Village\n            Community Empowerment (PMD) and for the National Management\n            Consultant (NMC). Evaluation studies and use of their\n            findings: well-conceived and targeted evaluations can\n            provide solid evidence of what works and what doesn't\n            work in the implementation of a program such as PNPM.\n            Findings from such studies can provide policy\n            recommendations to make improvements to project design and\n            implementation, and also help to determine the future\n            direction of the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - National Program for Community\n            Empowerment in Rural Areas

In 1998, Indonesia faced political\n            upheaval and financial crisis. The country was marred by its\n            graft-ridden political and administrative systems and\n            poverty had increased tremendously. Non-income poverty was a\n            serious problem in terms of high malnutrition and maternal\n            mortality rates, inadequate access to safe water and\n            sanitation, and education outcomes. Furthermore, inequality\n            was increasing and disparities between regions remained\n            high. Poverty alleviation had become a priority for\n            Indonesia. To accelerate government efforts to reduce\n            poverty and to ensure equity and inclusiveness, National\n            Program for Community Empowerment Program named Nasional\n            Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM), was announced by the\n            government. With technical and financial assistance from the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the\n            PNPM became a national program covering all villages and\n            cities in the country.
