Lessons learned follow. Although\n            conventional wisdom spells political stability as a\n            necessary ingredient for the successful implementation of a\n            reform program, the appraisal team factored political risk\n            into the operation, and attempted to minimize the\n            probability of policy reversals, by front loading initial\n            reform measures, as the prior actions for credit\n            effectiveness. Irrespective of the fact that\n            multiple-tranche operations are ill-suited for countries\n            under political instability, in this case, the risk of\n            \"wastage\" was minimized by linking the\n            disbursements of subsequent tranches, to the payment of\n            domestic arrears, which to a certain extent, the design\n            proved appropriate, with a result - though not the desired\n            ex ante - consistent with what would have happened if the\n            model of multiple-tranche operations, would have been\n            retained. As for capacity building, the idea to\n            \"budget\" technical assistance (TA), rather than\n            rely on a stand-alone project, has been positive: it\n            fostered ownership of reforms, and positively impacted\n            capacity building. But for this model to deliver expected\n            outcomes, a constant dialogue should be maintained on\n            implementation of the TA program. Further issues arise\n            regarding capacity building, and the sustainability of\n            assistance: varying degrees of success question the\n            modalities, while deeper \"institutionalization\" of\n            the skills acquired is still necessary. Finally,\n            institutional assessments should not just focus on\n            strengths, and weaknesses of individual agencies, but on the\n            communication channels, and interagency cooperation as well,\n            to ensure consistency between macroeconomic, and sectoral\n            dimensions of the policy dialogue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Public Finance Reform Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Public Finance Reform\n            Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1551920/niger-public-finance-reform-program-project","projn":"NE-Public Fin.
