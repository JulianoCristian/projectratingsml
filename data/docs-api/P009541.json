The\n            Bank responded very quickly to Government\u0092s request for\n            emergency assistance. The Bank's Resident Mission, as\n            part of the local consultation group of donors, made\n            preliminary assessments of the flood damage and with\n            assistance from headquarters staff. The Government, having\n            handled emergency operations previously, quickly geared into\n            action after the 1988 floods and made quick assessments of\n            the damage. Recognizing the need for external assistance,\n            the Government agencies, approached the donors with the\n            estimates of flood damage and request for aid. However, the\n            Government, particularly Planning Commission, was unable to\n            expedite the bureaucratic process of project approval and\n            fund release. Consequently implementation slowed down. There\n            are five key lessons learnt from project implementation.\n            These are: (a) government's lengthy project approval\n            and fund release procedures should be reduced to a very\n            minimum for emergency rehabilitation project; (b) devolution\n            of implementation responsibility to field staff expedites\n            project performance; (c) appointment of local consultants to\n            design and supervise projects improves quality of work; (d)\n            for multi-sectoral projects, IDA's supervision\n            responsibilities should be clearly delineated. Thus, while\n            for Bangladesh it is appropriate to have primary\n            responsibility in the Resident Mission, where an appropriate\n            person can be identified to be task manager, there should be\n            clear understanding and budgetary arrangements for back-up\n            support from HQ, particularly for components requiring\n            specialized technical staff; and (e) attention should be\n            given to possible adverse environmental impacts of flood\n            control projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Third Flood Rehabilitation\n            (Emergency) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Third Flood\n            Rehabilitation (Emergency) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/01/732019/bangladesh-third-flood-rehabilitation-emergency-project","projn":"BD-Flood Rehab III -- P009541","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Flood Control,Hydrology,Environmental Disasters & Degradation,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970625093739"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other transportation","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"base stations,bridges,cement,coastal\n            areas,culverts,Cyclone\n            Protection,drainage,dredging,embankment,embankments,environmental\n            impacts,feeder roads,Flood,flood control,flood control\n            infrastructure,flood control projects,flood control\n            structures,flood control system,flood damage,flood\n            damages,flood protection,flood protection scheme,Flood\n            Rehabilitation,flooding,floods,future\n            floods,girls,Highways,housing,hydrographic\n            surveys,motorcycles,navigation,passenger,pavement,periodic\n            maintenance,pipes,preparedness,primary schools,Private\n            sector,Public sector,radio,retaining walls,rivers,Road\n            Rehabilitation,road shoulders,Roads,rural roads,severe\n            floods,silt,snow,steel,Transport,Transport Authority,water\n            control,water levels"},"1":{"cdata!":"base stations,bridges,cement,coastal\n            areas,culverts,Cyclone\n            Protection,drainage,dredging,embankment,embankments,environmental\n            impacts,feeder roads,Flood,flood control,flood control\n            infrastructure,flood control projects,flood control\n            structures,flood control system,flood damage,flood\n            damages,flood protection,flood protection scheme,Flood\n            Rehabilitation,flooding,floods,future\n            floods,girls,Highways,housing,hydrographic\n            surveys,motorcycles,navigation,passenger,pavement,periodic\n            maintenance,pipes,preparedness,primary schools,Private\n            sector,Public sector,radio,retaining walls,rivers,Road\n            Rehabilitation,road shoulders,Roads,rural roads,severe\n            floods,silt,snow,steel,Transport,Transport Authority,water\n            control,water levels"}},"owner":"Econ.

Two\n            unusually severe floods occurred in 1987 and 1988. The aim\n            of the Third Flood Rehabilitation (Emergency) Project is to\n            restore priority infrastructure damaged by flooding so as to\n            promote efficient operation of the economy. It also aims to\n            ensure appropriate design and location of works and\n            equipment to minimize the risk of damage or loss arising\n            from future floods. The project consists of: (i)\n            rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and flood protection\n            works; (ii) rehabilitation of roads and associated\n            structures; (iii) repair and some reconstruction of primary\n            schools; (iv) repair of inland water transport facilities;\n            (v) repair of telecommunications facilities; (vi)\n            rehabilitation of urban infrastructure; and (vii) provision\n            of technical services by local and foreign consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Third Flood Rehabilitation\n            (Emergency) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Third Flood\n            Rehabilitation (Emergency) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/06/737404/bangladesh-third-flood-rehabilitation-emergency-project","projn":"BD-Flood Rehab III -- P009541","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Flood Control,Water Law,Engineering,Hydrology,Environmental Disasters & Degradation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961015140735"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other transportation","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aquifers,basins,catchment area,catchment\n            areas,coastal areas,coastal embankments,Crop Damage,crop\n            losses,Cyclone Protection,damages,disaster\n            preparedness,Drainage,drainage\n            systems,dredging,Drought,drowning,emergency\n            preparedness,Engineering,erosion,excess water,flash\n            flooding,flash floods,Flood,flood control,flood control\n            issues,flood control measures,Flood Control Project,flood\n            damage,Flood Disaster,flood disasters,flood emergency,flood\n            forecasting,Flood levels,flood plain,flood plains,Flood\n            Policy,Flood Policy Study,flood preparedness,Flood\n            Preparedness Study,flood problem,flood protection,flood\n            protection scheme,Flood Rehabilitation,Flood Relief,flood\n            stage,Flood Warning,Floods,future floods,heavy\n            rainfall,Irrigation,Irrigation canals,irrigation\n            systems,jetties,main rivers,monsoon\n            season,navigation,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            Exploration,preparedness,programs,river training,river\n            training works,rivers,Rural Electrification,severe\n            flood,severe floods,silt,streams,structures,Transport,Urban\n            Development,warning system,water level,water levels,Water\n            Transport,Waters,watershed,watershed management,waterways"},"1":{"cdata!":"aquifers,basins,catchment area,catchment\n            areas,coastal areas,coastal embankments,Crop Damage,crop\n            losses,Cyclone Protection,damages,disaster\n            preparedness,Drainage,drainage\n            systems,dredging,Drought,drowning,emergency\n            preparedness,Engineering,erosion,excess water,flash\n            flooding,flash floods,Flood,flood control,flood control\n            issues,flood control measures,Flood Control Project,flood\n            damage,Flood Disaster,flood disasters,flood emergency,flood\n            forecasting,Flood levels,flood plain,flood plains,Flood\n            Policy,Flood Policy Study,flood preparedness,Flood\n            Preparedness Study,flood problem,flood protection,flood\n            protection scheme,Flood Rehabilitation,Flood Relief,flood\n            stage,Flood Warning,Floods,future floods,heavy\n            rainfall,Irrigation,Irrigation canals,irrigation\n            systems,jetties,main rivers,monsoon\n            season,navigation,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            Exploration,preparedness,programs,river training,river\n            training works,rivers,Rural Electrification,severe\n            flood,severe floods,silt,streams,structures,Transport,Urban\n            Development,warning system,water level,water levels,Water\n            Transport,Waters,watershed,watershed management,waterways"}},"owner":"Econ.
