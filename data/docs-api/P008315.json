The following lessons may be drawn from the\n            experience of this project:: 1)  Rationalizing subsidy\n            support and introducing appropriate traffic costing models\n            are important pre-requisites to restoring the long-term\n            financial health of state-owned railway companies and moving\n            them towards commercial operation. 2) It is critical to the\n            success of a complex undertaking such as the installation of\n            an integrated Management Information System that sufficient\n            technical supervision and support be made available to\n            assist with resolving problems as they arise. 3) An\n            integrated Management Information System may be too complex\n            an undertaking to implement as a single package in a\n            transitioning economy; consideration should be given to a\n            phased design approach. 4)  Public Service Obligation\n            Subsidy should be for specific services that the government\n            considers socially necessary; such social services should be\n            transparent, explicitly defined and fully compensated as\n            part of a Contract Plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Railway Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Railway Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/6073696/bulgaria-railway-rehabilitation-project","projn":"BG-Railway Rehab -- P008315","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Bulgaria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050719085352"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Railways","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, authority, autonomy, Bank\n            management, Bank Performance, citizens, coaches, communist,\n            communist party, consignment, cost of capital, debt,\n            decision-making, Decree, democracy, drainage, East European,\n            embankments, employment, execution, financial crisis,\n            financial health, financial management, financial\n            performance, financial sustainability, Fiscal, fiscal\n            resources, Fiscal Year, flooding, foreign exchange, freight,\n            freight traffic, freight transport, government department,\n            government officials, hospitals, human resources, human\n            resources development, income, institutional arrangements,\n            Institutional Development, international accounting\n            standards, intervention, legal provisions, legislation,\n            legislative framework, macroeconomic stabilization,\n            marketing, Ministers, municipality, natural resources, net\n            benefits, operating costs, operating permits, passenger,\n            passenger coaches, passenger fares, passenger information,\n            passenger services, peer review, periodic maintenance,\n            private sector, private sector investment, privatization,\n            PSO, public expenditure, Public Service, Public Service\n            Obligation, rail, Rail Network, rail operator, rail\n            operators, rail sector, rail services, rail traffic,\n            RAILWAY, railway company, Railway Infrastructure, railway\n            lines, railway passenger service, railway reform, Railway\n            Regulator, RAILWAY REHABILITATION, railway restructuring,\n            railway staff, railway system, Railways, Rationalization,\n            reorganization, road transport, rolling stock, routes,\n            salvage, savings, social services, speed, state enterprises,\n            stations, structural adjustment, structures, technical\n            assistance, track, tracks, traffic patterns, trains,\n            transparency, welding, working ratio"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF026080-USTDP ENVIRONMENTAL\n            CONSL'T TRUST FUND,TF032104-BULGARIA - RAILWAY RESTRUCTURING,TF033930-BULGARIA - TRANSPORT, RAILWAYS,TF040621-ROMANIA - RAILWAYS AND BULGARIA\n            RAILWAY REHAB PROJECT","repnb":"32486"},"2224536":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/03/2224536/bulgaria-railway-rehabilitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/03/2224536/bulgaria-railway-rehabilitation-project","new_url":"2003/03/2224536/bulgaria-railway-rehabilitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/04/25/000094946_03041704015342/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/04/25/000094946_03041704015342/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"3922","datestored":"2003-04-25T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-03-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Railway Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is rated as satisfactory\n            and project sustainability is rated as likely. The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            rated satisfactory, overall. Lessons learned can be grouped\n            into four categories and concerned policy reforms and the\n            lending instrument; the design of the major information\n            technology project component; the optimization of track\n            renewal sub-projects; and the relationships between project\n            components. Project design made the Bank a legitimate\n            partner of the Bulgarian State Railway (BDZ) and the\n            government in transforming the railway sector over the\n            project period and provided key targets on which the debate\n            could focus. This was reinforced from 1999 on by the\n            visibility given to railway reforms by the IMF stabilization\n            program as well as the Bank's own growing concern with\n            structural adjustment and initiation of a broad programmatic\n            adjustment lending approach. But the opportunity offered by\n            the stabilization and adjustment programs could not have\n            been taken, had a strong relationship not been established\n            between the Bank, BDZ, and the Government through investment\n            lending. The excruciating experience in implementing the\n            project component aimed at establishing new management\n            information systems and the eventual failure of this\n            component cast doubt on the approach adopted in its design.\n            The approach was to use international turnkey contractors to\n            put together and install major systems. The radical nature\n            of the changes, the lack of a trial and error process, the\n            speed of decision making made necessary by the contract\n            implementation process, the high stakes but also uncertain\n            basis on which to make decisions, and the differences\n            between the contractors and their supervisors within BDZ\n            were such that an adversarial relationship was almost\n            unavoidable and could not be mitigated by a strong common\n            agreement on the ultimate objectives to be achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Railway Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Railway Rehabilitation
