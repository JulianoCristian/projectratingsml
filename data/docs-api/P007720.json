The overall performances of\n            both the Bank and the borrower are rated satisfactory.This\n            section analyzes lessons learned from two Bank operations,\n            the Health System Reform Adjustment Loan and the Health\n            System Reform Technical Assistance Projects (report nos.\n            17349 (PAD) and P7223 (PR) respectively) acting together to\n            support one reform process. Some of the lessons learned in\n            this section also apply to the TAL and are presented in the\n            TAL ICR and vice versa. Lessons learned are organized in\n            three parts: (1) overall comments on project design and\n            implementation; (2) issues related to the separation of\n            functions, resource allocation and  reimbursement\n            mechanisms; and (3) the redefined primary health care model.\n            Some of the lessons include the following: 1) In order to\n            increase the probability of success, reforms should consider\n            the  particular organizational and political environments\n            where the reform process is to be  launched and implemented.\n            2) Policy-based lending, such as the SECAL, is appropriate\n            if difficult policy decisions will be fully supported by the\n            central government and executive branch.  3) Policy-based\n            adjustment programs in the social sectors require more\n            intensive supervision than regular investment operations.\n            4) The Bank and the client could support the creation of a\n            monitoring and evaluation system capable of keeping a close\n            eye on the synergy that should accompany the  implementation\n            of a SECAL with the technical support of the TAL.  5)\n            Without mutual  collaboration between the Bank and an\n            identifiable force that moves the reform in both the\n            technical and the political arenas, there is high risk for\n            the Bank as well as for the Borrower of losing connection\n            with the actual implementation process. 6) Reforms do not\n            occur only with the support of policy conditionality; it is\n            necessary to  have legal changes accompany the technical\n            changes that the adjustment operation aims to  achieve. 7)\n            The real  separation of financing and delivery in\n            institutions that are regulators, payors and providers\n            requires political decisions at the highest level and legal\n            changes, as well as a \"bottom up\" approach\n            introducing management contracts and changing the\n            institutional culture. 8) In order for the separation of\n            functions to promote real efficiency gains, policy change\n            must be made to reflect the introduction and implementation\n            of incentives in the payment mechanism to health care\n            providers. 9) In order to ensure that significant changes in\n            the health care delivery model are made it is important to\n            aim for broader changes than those restricted to the\n            introduction of competitive elements such as \"free\n            choice\": extensions in coverage, changes in  protocols,\n            introduction of quality management techniques, among\n            others.10) Policy changes in the health care delivery model\n            should be managed in close connection with financial,\n            institutional and corporate reforms; otherwise the overall\n            impact of the reform is diminished in all areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Health System Reform (IMSS)

The reform will 1)\n            improve the financial management of the health insurance\n            system to ensure financial transparency; 2) introduce new\n            resource allocation and financial mechanisms to improve\n            efficiency and limit the fiscal impact of the proposed\n            reforms; 3) strengthen the institutional and regulatory\n            framework for health insurance to extend coverage to the\n            self-employed and informal sector workers; 4) ensure greater\n            transparency and accountability among providers; 5) develop\n            measures for quality assurance and user rights, and to\n            facilitate user choice; and 6) improve the quality and\n            efficiency of the IMSS health delivery system by supporting\n            decentralized decisionmaking, restructuring the health care\n            delivery network around a population-based system, and\n            introducing performance-based incentives for providers. The\n            reform program adopts a two-pronged approach. It develops\n            and implements health insurance financing reforms and the\n            necessary regulatory framework by a) separating financing\n            from service provision, increasing user choice and extending\n            coverage, and developing and implementing purchasing\n            mechanisms; and b) institutionally strengthening IMSS by\n            changing its
