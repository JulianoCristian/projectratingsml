First, it is intended to strengthen the\n            Government's capacity to carry out its economic\n            recovery program. Second, a strategy will be developed to\n            assist with the improvement of the country's presently\n            deteriorating natural environment. Finally, the project will\n            aid manufacturing enterprises that have been affected by the\n            ongoing trade.  To this end, the project entails  1) public\n            sector management support including assistance in the\n            programming, control and monitoring of public expenditures;\n            2) studies to be initiated to assess the degradation of\n            Haiti's natural environment; and 3) assessment and\n            support of the restructuring and development needs of\n            private industry to facilitate adaption to recent trade\n            reforms; and, 4) other related studies to be researched."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Technical Assistance
