Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) As evidenced by the allocation of expenditures\n            under the Government of Rwanda (GoR's) budget over the\n            period of the first PRSC/G series, the nominal amount\n            allocated to the social sectors and agriculture increased\n            due to the overall increase in public expenditure both in\n            nominal and real terms, accompanied by an increase in GDP\n            over the period. However, the share of the budget allocated\n            to these sectors remained steady or decreased slightly (as\n            in education). 2) The infrastructure sub sectors of water\n            and energy were successfully supported as part of the\n            service delivery agenda under the first PRSC/G series.\n            Elevating the dialogue on these sub sectors allowed donor\n            partners and GoR to address policy issues more efficiently\n            and effectively than had been the case exclusively through\n            projects. Sector priorities, support for local level private\n            operator schemes in water, extra electricity generation\n            capacity in energy, that were not being fully addressed\n            through projects received support under the PRSC/G series.\n            Inclusion in the PRSC/G series also forced these sub sectors\n            to examine weaknesses in sector strategies, policy\n            frameworks, Medium Term Economic Framework (MTEFs), and\n            planning and budgeting, and established a foundation for, or\n            accelerated, donor cooperation and the move to sector-wide\n            approaches. 3) In large measure, members of the Bank team,\n            including the task team leader and sector specialists,\n            remained the same over the course of all three PRSC/Gs in\n            the series. While this is unfortunately more often an\n            exception rather than the rule, continuity in team\n            leadership and team members was a contributing factor to the\n            success of the program. GoR strongly highlighted the impact\n            that team continuity had on the exceptionally robust\n            dialogue between GoR and the PRSC/G team. Such continuity\n            facilitated the building of strong relationships and trust\n            and understanding amongst all parties and allowed for\n            consistent follow-through on the agreed reform program. 4)\n            While significant progress is evident within sectors, more\n            work is needed to strengthen cross-sectoral linkages. The\n            health and water sectors have taken steps to coordinate\n            their efforts, but much more needs to be done to capture\n            synergies between sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - First, Second, and Third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit/Grant"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - First, Second, and Third\n

of\n            poverty, and outlines the key objectives and actions\n            required for reducing it. The surveys, and the national\n            rapid poverty assessments (NPAs) carried out at the\n            grassroots level, confirm that living conditions in Rwanda,\n            while slowly improving since 1994, continue to be very poor,\n            particularly in rural areas. Development partners strongly\n            supported Rwanda's PRSP process, and have universally\n            commended the Government of Rwanda (GoR) for the\n            consultative manner through which it was developed. The PRSP\n            was endorsed by the Boards of the Bank and Fund on August\n            12, 2002. The strategy was complemented by the development\n            of an Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The PRSP\n            identifies the private sector as the main engine of growth,\n            with the transformation of agriculture and the rural economy\n            as the leading source of growth in the near to medium term.\n            To deal with the legacies of genocide and structural\n            impediments to economic transformation, the PRSP outlines\n            five basic building blocks for economic growth and poverty\n            reduction-macroeconomic stability, human development, good\n            governance, partnership, and the prioritization of public\n            actions-and six priority action areas (a) rural development\n            and agricultural transformation; (b) human development; (c)\n            economic infrastructure; (d) good governance; (e) private\n            sector development; and (f) institutional capacity building\n            (see Box 2). The PRSP stresses the importance of defining\n            sectoral strategies and associated (MTEFs) to guide public\n            actions for implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            and Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda -

The report also proposes key measures that\n            the Government can take so that sector ministries, local\n            governments, and other institutions develop the capacity to\n            manage environmental and social issues during the\n            preparation and implementation of development programs and\n            projects, irrespective of the source of financing.\n            Rwanda's key environmental challenges concern soil\n            erosion, soil exhaustion, and overgrazing; deforestation;\n            impacts from water contamination including health and\n            sanitation impacts, and water weed infestation; loss of\n            biodiversity and habitats; and wetlands degradation. Adverse\n            environmental impacts in the education and health sectors\n            will be mitigated through developing an environmental\n            education curricula for students and teachers; including\n            sewage systems in sanitary facilities and providing water\n            from wells or water harvesting; building standpipes in\n            canteens and school kitchens; providing energy-saving\n            cooking stoves; preparing public health guidelines\n            concerning the water and food supply; preparing manuals for\n            public health awareness; disposing of medical and human\n            waste using locally constructed clay ovens; and training\n            public health inspectors and nurses. The Government will\n            address environmental impacts such as water\n            pollution/contamination by committing to the Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Strategy, which aims to provide a\n            sustainable, safe water supply and sanitation facilities\n            based on management, responsibility, and ownership by users.\n            In the Energy Sector, impact mitigation comprise preparing\n            environmental guidelines, conducting a Sectoral\n            Environmental and Social Assessment for the sector; building\n            the capacity of Electrogaz, the national parastatal, for\n            environmental management of natural resources; reviewing\n            wood fuel policy; launching a public awareness campaign for\n
