Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            There is a clear need for stronger monitoring and evaluation\n            of research projects. The lack of hard evidence about the\n            results of Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) investments in\n            research and extension is a considerable shortcoming of all\n            but one project. In each of these countries, agricultural\n            productivity has risen since the mid 1990s, with growth\n            increasingly based on intensification rather than area\n            expansion. All institutions need a portion of the budget\n            that is core funded to cover costs of maintenance and\n            upgrading of physical and human resource infrastructure. CGS\n            usually only fund operating costs and the subprojects they\n            finance have only 2-3 years' duration. The CGS model is\n            more likely to strengthen the strongest agencies providing\n            research and extension services than it is to reduce the\n            disparities between the strong and the weak. The principle\n            of competition between alternative service providers breaks\n            down where the range of providers is limited and many of the\n            potential providers lack the skills needed to prepare viable\n            sub-project proposals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Agricultural Technology and\n            Rural Education Project; Peru - Agricultural Research

The public, competitive selection of\n            research projects was the principal strength of the Project\n            from which all else flowed. The competitive format, the\n            thematic structure of strategically and socially relevant\n            research areas, and the multi-institutional and\n            multi-disciplinary mechanisms for initiating and\n            consolidating a fundamental shift in how agricultural\n            research was performed, fostered a more dynamic, organized\n            focus on the real needs of society, the economy and the\n            environments. The design motif promoted institutional\n            integration, higher quality research, and expanded research\n            horizons. Moreover, the thematic configuration of the\n            bidding events resulted in research projects with convergent\n            themes and activities, creating valuable opportunities to\n            exchange experiences and define joint strategies, formulate\n            new lines of research in partnership, and conduct evaluation\n            and wider dissemination of results, opportunities that\n            should be fully exploited. In addition, competitive systems\n            of research funding require a regulatory, and institutional\n            framework which promotes efficiency of financial management\n            to administer the multiple, diverse partnerships, and large\n            numbers of projects/subprojects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
