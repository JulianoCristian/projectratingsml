The project\n            includes: (a) San Carlos II: construction and erection of a\n            second penstock, four turbine-alternators and transformer\n            groups totalling 620 MW, and ancillary equipment and works;\n            (b) Calderas: construction of a 15 m high rock-fill dam on\n            the Calderas River, inlet and discharge tunnels,and a\n            surface power station with an 18 MW generating unit; (c)\n            construction to two 230-kV transmission lines, between San\n            Carlos and Medellin (90 km) and between Esmeralda and Yuma\n            (200 km), and expansion of the various terminal substations;\n            (d) consultant services for engineering, civil works and\n            supervision; (e) a study of dispatch aspects of the\n            interconnected system, as well as related training; and (f)\n            a study of ISA's manpower and training requirements,\n            and an associated training program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second San Carlos Hydro Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Second San Carlos\n            Hydro Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/05/726555/colombia-second-san-carlos-hydro-power-project","projn":"CO-San Carlos Ii-Power -- P006758","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912451056"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"alternative energy,coal,coal,coal\n            reserves,coke,commercial energy,crude oil,Debt,distribution\n            of electricity,domestic energy,domestic energy\n            supply,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic growth,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,Electricity generation,electricity\n            sales,electricity sector,Electricity\n            Supply,Employment,Energy Consumption,energy\n            generation,Energy Output,energy prices,Energy\n            Resources,energy sources,energy supply,energy\n            use,Engineering,Environmental Aspects,exchange\n            rate,falling,Final Energy Consumption,financial\n            resources,financial transfers,fuel,gas,gas,grid,Heat,Hydro\n            Power,hydro\n            resources,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,labor\n            force,mines,natural gas,oil,oil\n            refineries,petroleum,petroleum products,power\n            companies,power company,power distribution,Power\n            Generation,Power Systems,power utilities,primary\n            energy,Producers,productivity,refineries,Rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,safety,structures,transport,urban\n            centers,urban population,utilities"},"1":{"cdata!":"alternative energy,coal,coal,coal\n            reserves,coke,commercial energy,crude oil,Debt,distribution\n            of electricity,domestic energy,domestic energy\n            supply,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic growth,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,Electricity generation,electricity\n            sales,electricity sector,Electricity\n            Supply,Employment,Energy Consumption,energy\n            generation,Energy Output,energy prices,Energy\n            Resources,energy sources,energy supply,energy\n            use,Engineering,Environmental Aspects,exchange\n            rate,falling,Final Energy Consumption,financial\n            resources,financial transfers,fuel,gas,gas,grid,Heat,Hydro\n            Power,hydro\n            resources,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,labor\n            force,mines,natural gas,oil,oil\n            refineries,petroleum,petroleum products,power\n            companies,power company,power distribution,Power\n            Generation,Power Systems,power utilities,primary\n            energy,Producers,productivity,refineries,Rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,safety,structures,transport,urban\n            centers,urban population,utilities"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"2464"},"facets":{}}}
