There are four project components. The\n            first studies and makes recommendations on key policy areas\n            of land administration, including 1) land development\n            process; 2) land registration finance and fee structure; 3)\n            real property valuation framework; 4) forest boundary\n            demarcation and operational procedures policy study; 5)\n            fragmented land laws and regulations framework; and 6)\n            institutional arrangements for land administration. The\n            second component implements a Land Administration prototype\n            in six municipalities and focuses on accelerating the\n            issuance of land titles using existing administrative and\n            judicial proceedings, enhancing service delivery of land\n            registration, and improving coordination between the\n            environmental and natural resources agencies. This component\n            also implements a land record prototype which focuses on\n            record verification and reconstitution, creates a cadastral\n            map base, eliminates fake and duplicate titles, and links to\n            computerization initiatives. The third component supports\n            the Project Management Office and project implementation\n            offices. The fourth component designs the long-term program\n            of LAM, including one round of social assessment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Land Administration and\n            Management
