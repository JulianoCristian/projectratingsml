Neither the PDOs nor the project\n            components were revised. In total the project was extended\n            18 months over two restructurings. The following lessons\n            were learned from this project: (1) HCSP has shown that an\n            emergency project does not necessarily benefit from the\n            existence of an ongoing operation. HCSP\u0092s reliance on HSDP\u0092s\n            institutional assessment and implementation experience\n            accelerated preparation but introduced elements which later\n            affected implementation. These constraints might have been\n            avoided with a more detailed consideration of the special\n            characteristics of an emergency project. (2) Experience with\n            the Crisis Response Window (CRW) showed that Bank policies\n            and procedures are not always aligned with the need to\n            respond rapidly to emergencies. As a result, the planned\n            emergency procurements were executed more slowly than\n            anticipated. The Bank has since learned this lesson and\n            resolved the issue for future emergency projects. (3) While\n            combining an emergency response with a systems development\n            approach can be reasonably justified, combining the two\n            within a short time frame proved to be problematical. (4)\n            Though Bank policy promotes the integration of project\n            implementation responsibilities within existing Ministry\n            structures, the project offers a caveat for emergency\n            projects. When HCSP sought to integrate the project\n            responsibilities within the Ministry, there were significant\n            delays and a lack of clear responsibility; once an\n            independent Project Implementation Unit (PIU) was\n            established, implementation proceeded much more smoothly.\n            (5) Commercial sector supply chain indicators are not\n            necessarily appropriate for the public sector. Though the\n            project attempted to introduce the increased rigor of\n            private sector supply chain management indicators, the\n            effort was not entirely successful because of the way in\n            which the public sector assesses risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Health Commodity Security Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Health
