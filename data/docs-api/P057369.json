Ratings for the Judicial Reform Project for\n            Guatemala are as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to\n            the development outcome was negligible; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Judicial Conflict Resolution\n            Improvement Project for Colombia are as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. This Project\n            Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) suggests three broad\n            lessons. The first is that it is important to adapt the\n            objectives and design of the project to local law,\n            conditions, and peculiarities. The second lesson highlights\n            the need for flexibility in overall approach in the\n            conception of the project. In addition, it is essential to\n            solicit local knowledge as well as input from specific\n            beneficiaries in the process of selecting project\n            objectives, design, and implementation arrangements. The\n            third lesson is that it is unwise to rely exclusively on\n            by-products of case management software to generate the data\n            needed for adequate monitoring and evaluation. The key\n            recommendation for initiatives in judicial reform is that\n            more resources should be invested in identifying local\n            experts to give them a leading role in the design,\n            execution, and evaluation of projects. This will facilitate\n            greater adaptation to the specific conditions of each\n            country, and ultimately ensure ownership and sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -

   long-term initiative undertaken by the Government of\n            Colombia, under the leadership of the Superior Council of\n            the Judicature, aimed at improving judicial conflict\n            resolution services. The project is expected to allow the\n            testing of a participatory and compregensive organizational\n            change strategy to bring about change in court operations\n            which ensure people swifter, fairer, and more transparent\n            conflict resolution services. Beside the project management\n            component, the project has two main and interrelated\n            components. The first component supports a comprehensive\n            organizational change process in 37 participating civil\n            courts in the main urban centers of Colombia aimed at\n            generating notable improvements in the expediency and\n            quality in providing conflict resolution services and in the\n            productivity of judicial resources. These sub-components\n            address cultural change, human resource competencies and\n            capabilities, organizational structure change, information\n            systems, and court facilities. The second component supports\n            a broad communication and participatory strategy by the SCJ\n            aimed at ensuring public support and the involvement of\n            relevant actors. The communication strategy consists of\n            events, publications, and other means deemed necessary to\n            promote the proposed change effort among judicial staff,\n            media, relevant judicial actors, and public opinion at large."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Judicial Conflict Resolution\n            Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia -
