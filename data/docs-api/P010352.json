The railways ministry\n            remained in default of legal/financial covenants, and the\n            physical component of the Railway loan (the largest single\n            original component) did not achieve its objectives. Some key\n            lessons learned are as follows: A permanently reliable\n            source of maintenance funding is the single most important\n            factor determining the success of highway or railway\n            operations. Fundamental institutional reforms in the\n            implementing agency are required up-front as a pre-condition\n            for project approval. Consultants acting as Engineer must\n            have clearly stated responsibilities, including those\n            satisfying reasonable governmental audit requirements.\n            Highway contract administration needs to be significantly\n            improved to avoid costly claims against the employer.\n            Simplified construction administration should be adopted.\n            The implementing agency's technical and contract\n            administration capacity should be assessed at the time of\n            appraisal. If necessary the Borrower's audit staff\n            should be trained in Bank procurement audit procedures and\n            standard bidding documents. Vehicle overloading must be\n            effectively addressed to minimize damage to the network.\n            Preparation of railway projects with an operational\n            component must consider freight traffic issues within the\n            context of an overall logistics chain. Effective action must\n            be taken against defaults on loan covenants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Transport Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Transport

implementation of the sector reform program; iii)\n            rehabilitation, resurfacing and strengthening of 800 kms of\n            the National Highway; iv) measures for improving railway\n            operations (converting 15,000 freight wagons to roller\n            bearing axles, UHF and VHF equipment for improved train\n            control and monitoring, and introducing a management\n            information system); and v) replenishement of spare part\n            inventories in order to improve locomotive utilization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Transport Sector
