Some\n            lessons learned included: the condition of effectiveness,\n            which was inconsistent with the concept of an emergency\n            project, should be avoided to ensure project implementation\n            move forward quickly. In a country emerging from decades of\n            civil war, close coordination, collaboration, support, and\n            training are essential. Given the implementing\n            ministries' limited institutional capacity, close and\n            frequent contacts between them and the Bank project team,\n            mostly resident in country, have been essential. Continuity\n            of key staffing in both the implementing agencies and the\n            Bank is very important but hard to deliver, especially where\n            the security situation remains poor. This project confirmed\n            that the key management issues for emergency projects are to\n            keep the design simple and performance rating system\n            likewise - stick to outputs, not outcomes - and to put in\n            place the capacity and systems to monitor implementation\n            closely, especially procurement and financial management.\n            Where implementation consultants have a key role to play,\n            their appointment should be made a condition of Board\n            presentation. For a simple project in post-conflict areas a\n            defined road design standard agreed during preparation can\n            prevent significant cost and time overruns. Such a road\n            design standard should be part of the legal agreement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - National Emergency Rural\n            Access
