The project would empower\n            farmer and herder households in project areas to better\n            manage their grassland resources and improve the forage and\n            feed production on arable lands. More efficient and quality\n            focused livestock production would increase the farmers and\n            herders incomes and generate marketable surplus to improve\n            living standards. Developing efficient livestock marketing\n            systems in the project counties would also increase the\n            efficiency of the whole livestock production system and\n            contribute raising the living standards of farmers and\n            herders. The global environmental objective of the project\n            is to maintain and nurture natural grassland ecosystems to\n            enhance global environmental benefits. More specifically,\n            the project aims to mitigate land degradation, conserve\n            globally important biodiversity, and enhance carbon\n            sequestration, through promotion of integrated ecosystem\n            management in the grassland, desert, and forest ecosystems\n            of the Qilian Shan, Tian Shan, and Altaishan mountain ranges\n            in Western China. The global environmental objective would\n            be achieved by implementing community based grassland\n            management in selected project areas with high global\n            biodiversity values; providing incremental investments for\n            implementing grassland management plans; and carrying out\n            monitoring of these grasslands' habitats.  The project\n            has five components: (1) Grassland Management and Forage\n            Improvement; (2) Livestock Production Improvement; (3)\n            Market Systems Development; (4) Applied Research, Training,\n            and Extension; and (5) Project Management, Monitoring, and\n            Evaluation. The project will finance works, equipment,\n            materials, Technical Assistance (TA) and training.\n            Communities will contribute their labor. This constitutes\n            the Baseline Scenario. The GEF Alternative builds on the\n            Baseline Scenario b y conserving key mountain grassland\n            eco-systems and their biodiversity and carbon storage\n            capacity in selected sites of global environmental\n            significance. Four of the five project components have\n            incremental GEF financed activities that will: (a) conserve\n            global grassland values and native livestock\n            agro-biodiversity; (b) support applied research, training\n            and extension for multiplication of indigenous grassland\n            species for rehabilitation of degraded grasslands and the\n            protection of native sheep and yak; and (c) establish\n            integrated grassland management monitoring processes at\n            provincial, county and townships

Feed processing operations are believed\n            to be on a small scale and mostly run by households and\n            herders. The major potential environmental impacts are dusts\n            and noise, which will be minimized especially in residential\n            areas by putting crushing machines indoors. Wool packing\n            will not involve use of chemicals and so no wastewater from\n            wool washing is anticipated. However the operation should be\n            standardized and managed according to the principle of\n            minimum impact to the environment. Dead animals should\n            either be sent to the local epidemic prevention station for\n            disposals or be disposed in a centralized way to prevent\n            cross infection and environmental pollution. Chemical used\n            in the laboratories should be stored properly by type and\n            according to the management regulations for toxic materials.\n            After use, the chemicals should be properly handled and sent\n            to the designated disposal sites. Feedlots produce\n            significant quantities of farmyard manure (organic waste)\n            rich in nitrogen and phosphorus, which could potentially\n            pollute groundwater and surface water. It is necessary to\n            keep manure in sedimentation ponds for a period of time\n            before applying to agricultural fields and artificial pastures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Xingiang
