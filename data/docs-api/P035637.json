Ratings for the\n            First, Second, Third Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery\n            Credit Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Fourth Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit Grant\n            Project were as follows:  outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            and the Bank and the Borrower performance were satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included:  overall, the ERR operations\n            were effective in providing critical budget support to\n            Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) during the initial\n            post-conflict years. The effectiveness was greater in\n            directly supporting the demobilization effort under the DDR\n            program, achieving the initial protective, social, and\n            economic security advances, and in accomplishing process\n            improvements, than in achieving better governance, improved\n            allocation of budget resources and development results in\n            the longer run. Early start of Bank interventions and\n            informed risk taking can help consolidate the peace process.\n            Delayed adoption of a country strategy and programmatic\n            budget support weakens ownership, creates funding\n            uncertainty, and hampers capacity building under the\n            circumstances. Stronger signaling of longer-term resource\n            availability for budget support and capacity-building\n            substitutes for the lack of formal programmatic framework.\n            While project or program designs were kept simple and\n            realistic, more could have been done to develop an\n            appropriate results framework calibrated to post-conflict\n            country circumstances. The Bank is (often) expected to\n            assume a leading role in mobilizing and coordinating\n            external donor assistance in post-conflict situations, and\n            is not always adequately resourced to do this. In\n            recognition of this, post-conflict Bank programs may benefit\n            from senior management support that would enable country\n            teams to more appropriately structure

comprehensive and integrated\n            fashion within the context of that strategy; c) there is\n            close complementarity between the government's economic\n            recovery program
