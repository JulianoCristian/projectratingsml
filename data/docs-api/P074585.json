These four operations were\n            undertaken within a period of less than four years. The\n            first two credits were independent operations which were\n            intended to prepare for a series of Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits (PRSCs), and the last two operations were\n            part of a projected series of three PRSC operations. The\n            overall rating of the ERSC is highly satisfactory in\n            Implementation Completion Report (ICR'S) rating; and\n            the overall outcome of the ESAC, PRSC I, and PRSC II is\n            rated satisfactory in ICR rating; and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for all four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory. The main lessons of the review as follows: (i)\n            budget support and other program assistance need to be\n            undertaken within a medium-term policy framework. This\n            lesson was learned from the first two operations prior to\n            the PRSC program; (ii) complementary investment or capacity\n            building projects may be critical to the effectiveness of\n            direct budget support through a PRSC; (iii) successful\n            programmatic budget support through PRSCs requires careful\n            preparation. Prior analytical work and policy dialogue are\n            needed to prevent misunderstandings and inconsistent\n            expectations; and (iv) direct budget support is high-risk.\n            It is vulnerable to sudden loss of political support from\n            bilateral donors and is no less subject to sudden\n            termination than policy-based lending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia

- Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project is rated as follows: Outcome\n            is satisfactory but project sustainability is unlikely,\n            institutional development impact is modest, and the\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            satisfactory. Systemic lessons learned included:  Technical\n            assistance should accompany adjustment reforms in a country\n            with relatively weak institutions. Maintaining a recent\n            stock of good analytical work is essential in a country\n            where the Bank provides development policy lending. In a\n            Post-conflict situation, early understanding is needed\n            amongst all partners of the appropriate balance between\n            financing urgent needs and policy reforms.  The choice of\n            adjustment lending instrument for a low income country, and\n            the design of Bank policy conditionality should be based on\n            the Country Assistance Strategy. This should take into\n            account the maturity of the reform program put forth in the\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) , likely progress\n            with critical reforms, and the need to finance the PRSP. The\n            Bank needs to actively manage and supervise policy-based\n            lending in uncertain policy environments. Other lessons\n            specific to Ethiopia focused on the need to allow time to\n            test the Government's commitment to private sector\n            development ad the public expenditures management reform\n            agenda. Specifically, the tradition of mistrust between the\n            private sector and the Government will require closer and\n            more frequent dialogue, and should be addressed by mapping\n            out and adhering to a transparent medium-term reform\n            strategy with a sound legal framework, and clarity on the\n            role of government. Support for this will require a strong\n            and flexible partnership from the Bank based upon a good\n            stock of analytical work, continued in-depth dialogue\n            through policy-based lending building upon existing studies\n            and lending experience, and continued strong monitoring and\n            supervision of the reform agenda. As Ethiopia develops\n            accountable decentralized government, and as the\n            international community moves towards harmonized direct\n            budget support to assist them, the need for a transparent\n            dialogue around improved and more timely budgeting has\n            increased. Government needs to adhere to the financial\n            calendar before regions can budget with accuracy, and before\n            donors can align around it and receive timely information on\n            the budget that they are supporting. In addition the link\n            between policies and resource allocation in the budget needs\n            more attention through developing the public expenditure\n            management program.. The Bank should conduct public\n            expenditure reviews with a view to developing key budget\n            processes, and should seek a more open dialogue with the\n            Government.   More attention is needed to developing the\n            public expenditure management agenda. More time is needed to\n            test commitment to reforms aimed at private sector\n            development. But even where there is clear political\n            commitment to moving forward on a reform path, the\n            technocratic support to give the reforms impact takes longer\n            to develop."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Structural Adjustment\n            Credit Project  : Ethiopia - Structural

the investment climate for the private sector,\n            in support of the Government's pro-poor growth\n            strategy; deepening civil service reforms and strengthening\n            public expenditure management to improve the quality of\n            public services delivery. Within a context of peace and\n            macroeconomic stability, the Credit will help to sustain the\n            recovery of investment and growth and reduce poverty. The\n            reforms supported by the Credit wil lower transaction costs\n            for private investors and exporters, and improve the overall\n            business environment. Public sector management and\n            expenditure will increase public accountability and the\n            effectiveness with which essential services are delivered.\n            Future operations will emphasize the deepening of these\n            reforms, in the areas of further private sector growth,\n            decentralization and empowerment, capacity building, and\n            infrastructure and human development. The ESAC is a one\n            tranche, transition operation. It is expected to be followed\n            by Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) in later years\n            to accompany the full Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (PRSP) which is
