The project achieved its primary\n            objective of supporting economic growth through development\n            of an important indigenous resource. Bank performance\n            overall was satisfactory. The key lessons to be learned from\n            this project are: 1) In a project such as Yantan, which\n            relies heavily on local capabilities, it is important to\n            guard against over-optimism with respect to these\n            capabilities in areas where traditional Chinese\n            hydroelectric implementation has not provided exposure to\n            modem techniques and technology. In the context of\n            China's rapid economic growth, it is also important to\n            assess the manufacturing capacity and workload of local\n            suppliers and thus their capability to deliver on time; 2)\n            In the area of resettlement, the key lesson learned is that\n            for a large resettlement project such as Yantan, it is\n            important that project preparation in relation to\n            resettlement be at least as detailed as that of the\n            construction component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Yantan Hydroelectric
