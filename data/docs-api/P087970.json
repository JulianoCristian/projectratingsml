The specific development objectives of the\n            project were to achieve financial sustainability of\n            irrigation infrastructure in the West Delta and to promote\n            greater efficiency in the use of water resources established\n            through a public-private partnership and farmer's\n            participation. The project was approved by the Board on June\n            21 2007, but the loan agreement was not signed by the\n            Government until September 1, 2008 and the project was\n            declared effective on July 8, 2009. The loan became\n            effective only in October 2009. The implementation schedule\n            devised at appraisal (four years duration) turned out to be\n            highly unrealistic. Prequalification of bidders: based on\n            the Bank prequalification guidelines, a lengthy\n            prequalification process was completed by the end of 2007.\n            As a result of this process, five consortia were\n            prequalified. International (French, Spanish, Italian and\n            Chinese) and national contractors were amongst those\n            prequalified. Despite the fact that two pre-bid conferences\n            took place in March and May 2008, the first bidding exercise\n            of August 2008 was not successful as none of the\n            prequalified consortia submitted a bid. This was principally\n            due to: (i) the payment risks were considered too high; (ii)\n            the guarantees by the Government were not sufficient for the\n            private sector in the demand risk was not sufficiently\n            advanced to be satisfactory to the private sector. This was\n            linked to the fact that Public Private Partnership (PPP) in\n            construction and operation of large scale irrigation\n            projects is uncommon worldwide, and the willingness of the\n            private sector to assume the expected risks was limited.\n            After the project was approved by the Government and\n            declared effective in July 2009, the consortia expressed\n            their continued interest in the project but indicated that\n            they still considered that the payment / demand risk was too\n            great. The risk was perceived as both political (political\n            decisions might interfere with the companies' ability\n            to collect water charges from the farmers), as well as a\n            real credit risk (that farmers might default on their\n            promised to pay the irrigation tariff due to unforeseen\n            developments in the sector)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - West

 recommendations of the Environmental and Social Management\n            Plan (ESMP). The objective of the ESIA is to examine the\n            environmental, social, economic, physical, and biological\n            impacts in the areas which may be affected by the project,\n            and propose mitigation measures, monitoring plans, and\n            institutional and budgetary requirements to undertake these\n            as part of the environmental and social management plan\n            ESMP, both during the construction and operational phases of\n            the project. Some of the negative impacts and corresponding\n            mitigation measures are: decrease in available water with\n            extraction from Nile, mitigated by monitoring and\n            fulfillment of monthly water supply; change in hydrology of\n            Rosetta Branch of the Nile, mitigated by ex-ante assessment\n            of and the design and timing of specific mitigation measures\n            to guard against any potential erosion and sedimentation;\n            and change in water quality of the West Delta region,\n            mitigated by sewage treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main Report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt -
