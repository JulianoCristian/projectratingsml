Some lessons learned included:\n            for countries at an early stage in the decentralization\n            process, a learning-by-doing approach can be effective using\n            iterative adaptation, where the focus is on solving locally\n            nominated and defined problems, encouraging experimentation\n            and experiential learning, and engaging a broad set of\n            agents so that development efforts are viable, legitimate,\n            relevant, and supportable. A well-designed monitoring and\n            evaluation (M and E) framework can help to inform the work\n            of planning and finance units, and to inform revisions in\n            operational programs and training manuals. In political\n            settings without democratically elected subnational\n            authorities, a process of controlled or limited\n            participation within a de-concentrated framework can be\n            politically feasible, and help to ensure accountability and\n            efficient use of resources. While managing small scale,\n            public infrastructure investments is useful for building\n            subnational administrative capacity, managing lines of\n            credit for private investments that are vulnerable to\n            manipulation, and not well monitored or regulated, can\n            weaken legitimacy and the good will built up through\n            participatory

Some lessons\n            learned included: intensive supervision of the project by\n            the Bank helped in identifying and addressing issues quickly\n            and therefore to keep the implementation on track and\n            focused on its broad goals. The Bank team continuously\n            followed the impact of various approaches to training and\n            found that institutionalizing training courses in the\n            national training institutions was the most effective and\n            sustainable approach. Unfortunately, the lack of a training\n            plan for development of province and district level staff\n            left many without the necessary knowledge and skills to\n            consistently apply Bank procedures, such as the environment\n            and social safeguards. Preparation before the start of the\n            project of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system,\n            including baseline and target values, enabled project\n            implementers to start tracking project performance soon\n            after effectiveness. Consistent reporting on progress with\n            the indicators helped in ensuring that project was\n            successfully completed with only a slight delay. Including\n            an indicator on application of the environmental and social\n            management framework will help ensure that project\n            implementers and their supervisors pay

        capacity of District Administrations, and to plan and manage\n            small infrastructure investments in response to community\n            demand. Continued commitment by Government to fiscal and\n            administrative decentralization, particularly from\n            Ministries of State Administration and Planning and Finance;\n            as well as continued Government commitment to community\n            participation and empowerment. Sustained political and\n            budgetary commitment to the provision of basic\n            infrastructure and social services, and to the progress of\n            the public sector reform program. The project has the\n            following five components: Component 1) The Participatory\n            District Planning will develop a District-level\n            participatory planning system based on civil society\n            consultation, and participation. It will deepen and expand\n            the experience of a decentralized planning, and finance\n            pilot in Nampula province. Component 2) provides Financing\n            for small rural infrastructure in the annual plans that will\n            be made available to eligible districts as local investment\n            grants, up to a certain threshold and according to a set of\n            qualification criteria. Component 3) capacity building will\n            strengthen the training system to increase the capacity of\n            local administration officials to undertake key local\n            government functions more effectively. Component 4) Policy\n            Reform will consist of technical assistance to the\n            Government of Mozambique (GOM) to improve decision-making\n            through policy analysis and for the further development of\n            the institutional and policy framework for decentralization.\n            Component 5) will consist of a small core team of project\n            coordination staff at central and provincial level who will\n            fulfill some World Bank-specific fiduciary functions and\n            provide technical assistance to the government officials\n            responsible for project implementation and GOM fiduciary functions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Decentralized Planning and\n            Financing

in the design of the\n            participation and downward accountability system of the\n            District Planning and Financing Program that the World Bank\n            and the Government of Mozambique are negotiating for\n            implementation in four provinces of the center region of the\n            country. Specific objectives of the study are: 1) to review\n            the current rules, regulations and institutional\n            arrangements for community participation and accountability\n            in Mozambique; 2) to propose institutional arrangements and\n            mechanisms that will improve people's participation in\n            decision making during the district planning process and\n            during the implementation of the resulting district plans\n            and projects; 3) to review and propose ways (e.g.\n            communication strategy, flow of information) in which the\n            district administration or others handling public resources\n            could report faithfully to beneficiaries on the intended and\n            actual use of resources at the local level; 4) to assess and\n            propose institutional mechanisms through which local\n            communities can regulate the behavior of district officials\n            involved in the management of public resources and the\n            provision of public services; and 5) to propose capacity\n            building needs and institutional arrangements to improve\n            participation, transparency and accountability at community\n            and district levels. The report is organized in six\n            sections: section two, defines a framework of the key\n            dimensions that affect the quality of a participatory and\n            accountable district planning process; section three\n            analyzes the institutional context that exists in Mozambique\n            for rural local governance; section four describes the main\n            features of the Nampula Project and analyzes its main\n            strengths and limitations in terms of participation and\n            downward accountability; section five presents options and\n            mechanisms for addressing the limitations of the Nampula\n            Project; and section six summarizes the main conclusions and recommendations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Participation,
