Some lessons\n            learned included: the country's administrative culture\n            is an important determinant of success in institutional\n            development. The project had an ambitious and broad\n            institutional development program. This was undoubtedly\n            influenced by the awareness and technical competence of the\n            key managers in the sector during preparation. However, the\n            development program tottered and eventually was implemented\n            only in part. This result came about because the\n            institutional development program depended on many entities\n            other than the road administration. These other entities may\n            not have understood the planned program, nor had other\n            objectives, and this had an effect on the final process and\n            outcome. Therefore, it is important that all involved actors\n            are on the same page, or that the program goes forward\n            slowly so that experiential understanding has time to\n            develop among all affected interests. Local consultants are\n            preferred and can be more effective and better accepted than\n            foreign consultants for technical assistance. This\n            preference for local consultants derives from the awareness\n            that technical assistance is not purely technical but also\n            depends on understanding the local administrative culture,\n            important actors, and informal connections. A corollary is\n            that use of local consultants should become more widespread\n            but this would require that the Bank increases its\n            supervision work as supervision teams must train and\n            supervise the local consultant. The cost of this type of\n            supervision should be considered, and also the possibility\n            that the cost of all supervision could be paid by the\n            Borrower and made explicit in the loan agreement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Road Transport Sector\n            Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan - Road Transport\n

subsectors in Kazakhstan. There are five main components.\n            The first rehabilitates priority sections of national roads\n            by funding civil works to repair road sections; to\n            reconstruct, relocate, or replace bridges; and to build a\n            road bypass. The second component strengthens routine road\n            maintenance by building the maintenance capability of the\n            state road enterprise and road maintenance companies; and\n            finances maintenance equipment and spare parts. The third\n            component strengthens the roads department of a key road\n            maintenance and construction organization by establishing\n            procedures in planning, budgeting, and monitoring as well as\n            in supervising roadworks; training contractors in bid\n            preparation, contract administration, cost control,\n            management, and quality control; and strengthening the road\n            department's training capability. The fourth component\n            improves the enforcement of road transport policies and\n            regulations, improves systems to collect and process data,\n            and develops a more competitive market for inter-city and\n            rural passenger transport services.
