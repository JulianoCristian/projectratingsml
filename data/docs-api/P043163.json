The\n            project, designed to finance a time slice (1998 to 2002) of\n            the FRMP, consists of: (1) civil works to increase the\n            capacity and traffic safety of the federal network,\n            including providing additional lanes on some road sections,\n            building climbing lanes on others, improving horizontal and\n            vertical alignments, providing adequate road shoulders and\n            curbs and removing hazardous spots; (2) institutional\n            strengthening directed at the Secretariat for Communications\n            and Transport (SCT) and selected state highway organizations\n            for improving management systems and procedures, training\n            staff and reviewing the role and needs of the SCT centers in\n
