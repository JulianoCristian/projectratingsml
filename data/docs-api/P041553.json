Among the\n            lessons learned, it is highlighted that potential\n            macroeconomic reforms, and privatization require an\n            established technical capacity to achieve such reforms,\n            based on an essential political commitment. This is\n            exemplified by the experience of the joint implementation of\n            this project, and the Third Structural Adjustment Credit\n            Project, which showed that the combination of an adjustment\n            operation, and of a capacity building operation, does\n            provide satisfactory outcomes, while underscoring the\n            importance of harmonized activities, to achieve micro, and\n            macroeconomic reforms in parallel. Another lesson spells out\n            the need to implement public awareness campaigns,\n            irrespective of possible prolonged dialogues, which by\n            themselves may not necessarily lead to measurable\n            indicators, or outputs. Though understandably there is the\n            temptation to move ahead with numerical targets for\n            enterprises to be privatized (or liquidated), it is also\n            true that the government's refusal to render public\n            awareness, may in the end limit the overall scope of the\n            program. Specifically, due to budget constraints on the\n            Bank's side, both a follow-up in the judicial\n            component, and public awareness were neglected; indeed, a\n            regulatory seminar would have raised awareness to forward\n            the utilities privatization, while the judiciary system\n            remains a major cause for the vulnerability of the banking\n            sector, particularly deterring private investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -

The project will provide additional financing to\n            complete the public enterprise privatization work in the\n            agriculture and financial sectors and enlarge the scope of\n            privatization.

Finally, the\n            project will prepare the groundwork for the next adjustment\n            sector operation (The Enterprise Reform and Divestiture\n            Credit) scheduled for FY97. More specifically, the project\n            objectives are to: 1) put in place an adequate and\n            transparent institutional framework for\n            privatization/liquidation and implement a broad\n            privatization program; 2) improve the regulatory and\n            business environment in a limited number of well targeted\n            areas complementary to the privatization program; 3)\n            reorganize the loan recovery agency and support the\n            restructuring of two banks; and 4) provide preliminary\n            support to the judiciary to initiate a program of reforms\n            over the next few years. To achieve these objectives, the\n            project will consist of the four following complementary\n            components: 1) privatization and liquidation, which will\n            provide consultant services and basic equipment; 2)\n            restructuring of two banks and the loan recovery agency; 3)\n            preliminary support to improve the private sector\n
