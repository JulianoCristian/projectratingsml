This project restructuring covers a second extension of\n            the grant's closing date of an additional seven and\n            half (7.5) months, from November 13, 2014 to June 30, 2015,\n            to (i) finalize ongoing studies under component one and two\n            on climate mitigation and adaptation, (ii) prepare a basic\n            Biennial Update Report (BUR) of the Argentine Republic to\n            the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n            (UNFCCC), and (iii) conduct related dissemination work and\n            provincial level workshops on related capacity building. The\n            restructuring includes reallocation of funds between\n            disbursement categories and the components, as well as a\n            revision of the results framework.

This project restructuring covers a second extension of\n            the grant's closing date of an additional seven and\n            half (7.5) months, from November 13, 2014 to June 30, 2015,\n            to (i) finalize ongoing studies under component one and two\n            on climate mitigation and adaptation, (ii) prepare a basic\n            Biennial Update Report (BUR) of the Argentine Republic to\n            the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n            (UNFCCC), and (iii) conduct related dissemination work and\n            provincial level workshops on related capacity building. The\n            restructuring includes reallocation of funds between\n            disbursement categories and the components, as well as a\n            revision of the results framework. Said revision reduces the\n            number of targeted adaptation studies and excludes the final\n            studies on mitigation and adaptation policies and measures\n            (P&M). Further, it improves measuring of intermediate\n            results. The reductions reflect that the project will not be\n            able to complete key contributions to P&M and\n            integration of climate change priorities into the\n            Recipient\u0092s development strategies and relevant sector\n            programs. However, the project will undertake all efforts to\n            produce a final report on the project results that could be\n            presented to the UNFCCC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Third National Communication to\n            the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n            Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Third National\n            Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on\n            Climate Change Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2014/12/24050765/argentina-third-national-communication-united-nations-framework-convention-climate-change-project-restructuring","count":"Argentina","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptation, adaptation component, adaptation\n            options, adaptation policies, adaptation studies,\n            administrative procedures, biomass, capacity building,\n            carbon, carbon capture, CLIMATE, Climate change impact,\n            climate change mitigation, climate change scenarios, Climate\n            Change Strategy, climate mitigation, climate modeling,\n            climate models, climate variability, cost-benefit, emission,\n            energy efficiency, Environmental, extreme weather, extreme\n            weather events, financial instruments, forestry, FRAMEWORK\n            CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE, fuels, GHG, global climate,\n            GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY, Greenhouse, Greenhouse gas,\n            Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, labor\n            force, land use, mitigation policies, mitigation potential,\n            National Adaptation, National Climate, National Climate\n            Change, Natural Resources, ongoing adaptation, renewable\n            energy, resilience to climate change, Sugar cane,\n            Sustainable Development, transport sector"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Proyecto Relativo a la\n            Tercera Comunicacion Nacional a la Convencion Marco de\n            Naciones Unidas Sobre Cambio Climatico"}},"topic":"Climate Change Impacts m1326159 1773,Climate Change Law m1327365 959,Climate Change m1326829 567,Climate Change Mitigation m1327079 579,Climate Change Adaptation Impacts m1327768 1750","projn":"AR-Third National Communication Unfccc -- P116974","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Science of Climate Change,Climate Change Mitigation and Green House Gases,Environmental Economics & Policies,Adaptation to Climate Change,Climate Change Economics","teratopic":"Science and Technology Development,Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20150225125229"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Public administration- Agriculture, fishing\n            and forestry,Public administration- Water, sanitation and\n            flood protection,Public administration- Transportation,Public administration- Energy and mining","theme":"Climate change","historic_topic":"Science and Technology Development,Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"Global Environment Project","topicv3":"Climate Change Impacts m1326159 1773,Climate Change Law m1327365 959,Climate Change m1326829 567,Climate Change Mitigation m1327079 579,Climate Change Adaptation Impacts m1327768 1750","owner":"Envir & Nat.
