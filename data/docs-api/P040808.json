Ratings for the Biodiversity\n            Conservation Project (ABC) for Argentina were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: The Bank should encourage natural resource project\n            managers to take advantage of rapidly changing advances in\n            biodiversity conservation methods and tools to complement\n            traditional on-the-ground monitoring of indicator species\n            surveys. These include satellite imagery and aerial\n            photographs of habitat vegetation cover, or real-time remote\n            monitoring devices and camera traps when conservation of\n            specific species is the objective. Blending different\n            lending instruments, such as International Bank of\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans with Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) grants, to achieve different\n            natural resource management objectives can be an effective\n            way to engage clients in addressing the full range of sector\n            challenges they face. For example, the decision to use an\n            IBRD loan to help Argentina increase park system revenues\n            under the NFPA Project while preserving ecoregions of global\n            significance under the ABC Project justified the use of a\n            GEF grant. When experimenting with new techniques or\n            approaches to land-use practices or natural resource\n            management, it is best to approach experimental\n            interventions in a measured way assuming that unexpected\n            difficulties, costs, and delays will inevitably arise. The\n            NFPA Project conducted applied research projects on\n            compatible land-use practices in productive landscapes while\n            the ABC Project introduced alternative, less destructive\n            productive activities in park buffer zones."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Native Forests and Protected\n            Areas Project; Argentina - Biodiversity Conservation

performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            tourism can be a positive force and successful investment in\n            flagship protected areas may generate benefits for the\n            entire protected areas system The investments in the four\n            Patagonian parks under the project were highly successful in\n            their outcomes for the individual parks. In addition to the\n            conservation of biodiversity, they saw increases in their\n            fees collected, improved infrastructure and equipment for\n            their personnel, and enhanced visitor experiences. These\n            conditions create a favorable image for decision-makers as\n            sound investments for the national budget and interest is\n            generated at the national level tourism agencies and from\n            local governments in other regions that will like to benefit\n            from similar investments in parks within their localities.\n            Applied research projects are successful when attention is\n            given to stakeholders and producers needs, but weak local\n            capacities may hinder execution and sustainability. The\n            project provided for many research projects that were\n            developed to address real needs of producers facing\n            challenges in regard to degradation of natural resources,\n            sustainable production, and forest management. These\n            experiences are being widely disseminated both nationally\n            and internationally. However, those projects that were\n            located in poorer eco regions where the capacities of\n            beneficiaries, academic institutions, government agencies,\n            and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) was weaker, faced\n            more problems ranging from a lack of consensus regarding\n            thematic approaches, to the rate of disbursement and\n            implementation. Good environmental baseline information is\n            not available in these areas generally, making it more\n            difficult to target research approaches adequately, however\n
