The project will\n            establish about 82,000 ha of forest plantations, introduce\n            forest improvement measures on existing young plantations\n            and natural forests, construct and upgrade about 1,900 km of\n            forest roads and tracks, and expand equipment and vehicle\n            fleets. It will provide for the construction of about\n            l57,000 sq m of buildings and 1,100 km of utility lines and\n            the establishment of wood processing facilities.

state forest farms in Guangdong,\n            Heilongjiang and Sichuan Provinces. The project will\n            establish about 82,000 ha of forest plantations, introduce\n            forest improvement measures on existing young plantations\n            and natural forests, construct and upgrade about 1,900 km of\n            forest roads and tracks, and expand equipment and vehicle\n            fleets. It will provide for the construction of about\n            l57,000 sq m of buildings and 1,100 km of utility lines and\n            the establishment of wood processing facilities. The project\n            will strengthen forest research facilities in four provinces\n            and establish extension centers in ten provinces. A\n            technical assistance component will provide overseas\n            training opportunities (533 man-months) in logging, forest\n            road construction and forest production, research and\n            extension; and consulting services (34 man-months) in\n            forestry research and extension, and soil science. At full\n            development the project will produce annually about 546,000\n            cubic meters of roundwood, and 10,000 cubic meters of\n            plywood and other miscellaneous wood products to meet strong\n            internal demand."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Forestry Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Forestry Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/05/741804/china-forestry-development-project","projn":"CN-Forestry-268016 -- P003430","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970818101452"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,agricultural land,agricultural\n            output,Agriculture,animal\n            husbandry,Audits,bamboo,boxes,chemical fertilizers,demand\n            for timber,Economic\n            Analysis,Employment,eucalyptus,expenditures,Farms,felling,fiberboard,fisheries,Forest,Forest\n            Areas,forest cover,Forest Enterprise,forest\n            exploitation,forest fire protection,Forest\n            Improvement,forest industries,forest lands,Forest\n            Management,forest plantations,forest production,forest\n            products,forest reserves,forest resource,Forest\n            Resources,Forest Roads,forest soils,Forestry,forestry\n            activities,forestry department,Forestry Development,forestry\n            education,Forestry extension services,Forestry\n            Policy,forestry products,forestry research,Forestry\n            Sector,forestry\n            workers,forests,fuelwood,furniture,imports,Income,insurance,labor\n            force,labor productivity,logging,logs,natural\n            forests,packing,paperboard,particleboard,pines,plantation\n            forests,planting,plywood,poles,population\n            densities,production costs,pulp,pulpwood,Roundwood,rural\n            areas,saws,state forest,state forest\n            enterprises,timber,Timber Processing,Timber\n            Production,timber products,timbers,tree nurseries,Tree\n            Species,trees,veneer,Wood,Wood Processing,wood processing\n            plant,wood products,Wood residues,wood-based panels"},"1":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,agricultural land,agricultural\n            output,Agriculture,animal\n            husbandry,Audits,bamboo,boxes,chemical fertilizers,demand\n            for timber,Economic\n            Analysis,Employment,eucalyptus,expenditures,Farms,felling,fiberboard,fisheries,Forest,Forest\n            Areas,forest cover,Forest Enterprise,forest\n            exploitation,forest fire protection,Forest\n            Improvement,forest industries,forest lands,Forest\n            Management,forest plantations,forest production,forest\n            products,forest reserves,forest resource,Forest\n            Resources,Forest Roads,forest soils,Forestry,forestry\n            activities,forestry department,Forestry Development,forestry\n            education,Forestry extension services,Forestry\n            Policy,forestry products,forestry research,Forestry\n            Sector,forestry\n            workers,forests,fuelwood,furniture,imports,Income,insurance,labor\n            force,labor productivity,logging,logs,natural\n            forests,packing,paperboard,particleboard,pines,plantation\n            forests,planting,plywood,poles,population\n            densities,production costs,pulp,pulpwood,Roundwood,rural\n            areas,saws,state forest,state forest\n            enterprises,timber,Timber Processing,Timber\n            Production,timber products,timbers,tree nurseries,Tree\n            Species,trees,veneer,Wood,Wood Processing,wood processing\n            plant,wood products,Wood residues,wood-based panels"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia HQ Unit (EACCQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"5394"},"facets":{}}}
