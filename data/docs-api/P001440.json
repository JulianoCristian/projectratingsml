The Bank performance was fairly good during\n            the early stages of the project cycle including appraisal.\n            Project supervision by the International Development\n            Association (IDA) was good up to the suspension of\n            disbursements. Supervision teams were able to agree with the\n            Government of Liberia (GOL) on changes required to\n            facilitate the smooth implementation of the project. This\n            plan joins the long list of projects that encountered delays\n            in their implementation schedule, due to lack of adequate\n            counterpart funding. Since it is so difficult to anticipate\n            periods in the life of the project when financial\n            constraints might become so severe as to paralyze it, there\n            is wisdom in the Bank's policy of using the given\n            region's profile for determining the implementation\n            schedule. Uncertainty and confusion between the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) and high level officials at the\n            Ministry of Education (MOE) resulted from changes of\n
