The project has a\n            core component enhanced by two small supplementary\n            components: (1) Restructuring services, the main component,\n            comprises a direct credit line of the Ministry of Finance to\n            about 250-270 eligible private enterprises to improve their\n            operations and to obtain new market-based financing. (2) The\n            restructuring promotion component will reinforce the core\n            component by soliciting demand, improving the quality of\n            enterprise sub-projects, supporting a marketing program, and\n            developing targeted short workshops. (3) The market\n            information improvement component will finance the\n            development and dissemination of a database of domestic\n            consulting firms, which will reinforce the core component by\n            facilitating teaming arrangements between foreign and\n            domestic consulting firms and transfers of skills and\n            know-how to domestic firms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia - Enterprise Restructuring Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russia - Enterprise Restructuring\n            Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/05/694802/russia-enterprise-restructuring-services-project","projn":"RU-Ent Res Servs -- P046448","subtopic":"Small Scale Enterprise,Microfinance,Municipal Financial Management,Private Participation in Infrastructure,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Technical Annex","teratopic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970818102801"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-1","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            services,assets,auctions,Auditing,AUDITS,bank\n            failures,boards of directors,budget constraints,capital\n            markets,cities,company,company information,corporate\n            finance,corporate governance,CORPORATE\n            OWNERSHIP,corporations,crowding\n            out,debt,disclosure,economies in\n            transition,employment,ENTERPRISE FINANCE,enterprise\n            reform,Enterprise Restructuring,Enterprise Support,Financial\n            Institutions,financial management,financial\n            markets,Firms,FISCAL YEAR,Holding\n            Companies,inflation,insurance,interest rates,inventory,Joint\n            Stock Companies,large\n            enterprises,legislation,liquidity,local government,natural\n            resources,Present Value,private commercial banks,private\n            enterprises,Privatization,reorganization,shareholders,small\n            firms,social services,structural\n            adjustment,subsidiaries,suppliers,tax\n            concessions,taxation,Technical Assistance,transition\n            economies,wages,Working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            services,assets,auctions,Auditing,AUDITS,bank\n            failures,boards of directors,budget constraints,capital\n            markets,cities,company,company information,corporate\n            finance,corporate governance,CORPORATE\n            OWNERSHIP,corporations,crowding\n            out,debt,disclosure,economies in\n            transition,employment,ENTERPRISE FINANCE,enterprise\n            reform,Enterprise Restructuring,Enterprise Support,Financial\n            Institutions,financial management,financial\n            markets,Firms,FISCAL YEAR,Holding\n            Companies,inflation,insurance,interest rates,inventory,Joint\n            Stock Companies,large\n            enterprises,legislation,liquidity,local government,natural\n            resources,Present Value,private commercial banks,private\n            enterprises,Privatization,reorganization,shareholders,small\n            firms,social services,structural\n            adjustment,subsidiaries,suppliers,tax\n            concessions,taxation,Technical Assistance,transition\n            economies,wages,Working capital"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF035837-RUSSIA - ENTERPRISE\n            RESTRUCTURING SERVICES,TF034972-RUSSIA - ENTERPRISE\n            RESTRUCTURING SERVICES PROJECT,TF034882-RUSSIA - ENTERPRISE\n            RESTRUCTURING PILOT PROJECT,TF034389-RUSSIA - ENTERPRISE\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJECT,TF034028-RUSSIA - ENTERPRISE SUPPORTII","repnb":"T7070"},"facets":{}}}
