As for the Irrigation Improvement Project\n            (IIP), ratings differ from the ICR's, in that project\n            outcome, sustainability, and institutional development\n            impacts are downgraded to moderately satisfactory, likely,\n            and modest respectively, but concurs on satisfactory\n            performances by the Bank and Borrower. Experience confirms a\n            number of the Operations Evaluation Department - OED -\n            lessons: It is essential to understand sector institutions,\n            their governance, incentive structures, and\n            interrelationships before finalizing an investment\n            operation. A first step is to ensure that all stakeholders\n            are identified, and participate in project design. Failure\n            to do so risks that some objectives will not be fully owned,\n            and that lack of cooperation among key organizations, will\n            jeopardize achievements. Whatever water infrastructure is\n            provided or improved, a fundamental requirement for\n            sustainability is building adequate technical, and\n            beneficiary capacity to allow an integrated operation and\n            maintenance, as well as a dispute resolution mechanism. This\n            is particularly important when management is devolved\n            hierarchically, and separated between a public service\n            provider, and private users groups. Many countries have\n            excellent human and technical resources, particularly in the\n            private sector, and good project design needs to carefully\n            balance the type, scale, and use of external and internal\n            consultants. Too much foreign technical assistance\n            undermines local ownership, and causes resentment - too\n            little, risks inadequate capacity-building. Water\n            conservation is difficult to achieve if the water fee\n            structure is not linked to volumes of water used. In turn\n            this requires investment in water measurement, monitoring\n            and recording equipment, and a willingness to abandon the\n            crop and area basis for charging, as it provides no\n            incentive to farmers to conserve water."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Tehran Drainage and Irrigation\n            Improvement Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iran - Tehran Drainage and\n            Irrigation Improvement Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/11/5505996/iran-tehran-drainage-irrigation-improvement-projects","projn":"IR-Irrigation Improvement -- P005212,IR-Tehran Drainage -- P005216","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20041216093519"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage,Agricultural extension and research,Flood protection","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development, agricultural\n            extension, agricultural extension services, agricultural\n            production, Agricultural Research, agricultural subsidies,\n            Agriculture, barley, basin, bidding, broad range, canals,\n            channels, clean-up, climatic conditions, conservation,\n            construction, cost savings, Crop production, Crop yields,\n            crops, cultivation, debris, decentralization, discharge,\n            diversion, DRAINAGE, drainage system, drainage systems,\n            drainage tunnels, drains, drought, economic analysis,\n            economic impact, ecosystem, environmental benefits,\n            environmental impacts, environmental management, equipment,\n            farmers, farming, farms, feed, financial management, Fish,\n            fisheries, flooding, gravel, groundwater, imports, income,\n            incomes, IRRIGATION, irrigation canals, irrigation\n            development, irrigation systems, land use, lateral drains,\n            local capacity, Marshes, natural resource management,\n            natural resources, Natural Resources Management, on-farm\n            water management, orchards, overhead costs, pesticides,\n            pests, pilot farms, pollution, private sector, procurement,\n            productivity, programs, project management, river, salinity,\n            sciences, sediment, soils, surface water, sustainable\n            environment, sustainable use, technical assistance,\n            transparency, urban water, waste management, water\n            application, Water Authorities, water control structures,\n            water fees, water logging, water management, water quality,\n            water resource, water resource management, water resources,\n            water resources management, water savings, Water shortages,\n            water supply, water treatment, water use, water use\n            efficiency, water user groups, watershed, watershed management"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF),Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF021251-PHRD-JAPANESE CTF (USD ACCOUNT),TF037102-YEMEN - SANA'S WS.,\n            NAT'L COM.

The main lessons follow. It is\n            suggested that the broad project objectives, and the vast\n            geographical spread in different subproject areas, were\n            overly ambitious, of particular importance since over a long\n            period, the Bank had suspended lending to Iran. Rather, the\n            project design should have been conservative, given this\n            extended lending inactivity, while the agencies'\n            implementing capacity was also overestimated, whose failures\n            were reflected in its weak staff capacity, all factors that\n            influenced negatively in the implementation process. Another\n            reason for the implementing inability, was the fact that the\n            financial resources foreseen for the Department of\n            Environment (DOE), were allocated to the Ministry of\n            Agriculture budget, and this lack of counterpart funds\n            resulted in the under allocation of budget to DOE, which\n            included project management inefficiency, and procurement\n            problems. Additionally, beneficiary participation would have\n            allowed faster irrigation implementation works, as\n            demonstrated by their involvement at a later stage, creating\n            the ownership, instrumental to achieve sustainable water\n            management. Similarly, operation and maintenance should have\n            been prepared early on, to ensure investments sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Irrigation Improvement
