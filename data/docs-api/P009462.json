Credit\n            effectiveness was unsuccessfully extended three times to\n            enable the Government to meet the conditions of\n            effectiveness. Managerial and technical weaknesses of the\n            Borrower emerged as the main reason for the non\n            implementation of the project. The key lessons learned from\n            the project are the following. (A) One major lesson learned\n            from the failure of this project to be implemented is the\n            strong inter dependencies among sequential investments. (B)\n            Protracted procurement actions under the Second Gas\n            Development Project (SGDP) seriously impacted the\n            implementation of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Project.\n            (C) The financial power of the Operating Companies (OCs)\n            should be raised adequately so that they have the authority\n            to independently process procurement of goods and services\n            without going for the approval of Petrobangla or the\n            Government of Bangladesh (GOB)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
