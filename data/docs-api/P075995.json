Reduce nutrient leaching to groundwater quality by\n            introducing better manure storage and handling, and nutrient\n            management practices. Improve drinking water quality by\n            reducing nitrate and bacteria in groundwater through\n            collecting manure from individual farmer's homesteads\n            and storing in communal platforms. Monitor groundwater\n            quality to determine the effect of better nutrient\n            management practices. Monitor soil to establish the effect\n            of better farming systems on soil erosion and soil and water\n            quality. Monitor the increase of flora and fauna resulting\n            from the decrease of chemical and fecal material.
