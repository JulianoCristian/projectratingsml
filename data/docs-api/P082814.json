Ratings for the Social Sector Reform\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for Albania were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            high quality of the Bank's analytic work and technical\n            assistance is necessary but not sufficient for\n            effectiveness. Also important are the involvement and buy-in\n            of the government and other key stakeholders and the\n            strategic packaging of support with other Bank products and\n            services. One-tranche DPLs can be transformative and support\n            reform momentum if: (i) build on solid analytic work; (ii)\n            can effectively leverage critical policy change (for\n            example, legislation) that may not gain sufficient traction\n            through sector dialogue alone; and (iii) supported by\n            continuity in the sector policy dialogue and lending after\n            the DPL closes. Political economy is critical to factor into\n            reform design and risk management. Neglect of some aspects\n            of political economy is likely to have undermined prospects\n            for the full and successful implementation of health reforms\n            under the HSMP. The sequencing of reforms under the social\n            assistance DPL and its follow-on implementation support is\n            likely to have mitigated potential implementation setbacks\n            associated with political feasibility, capacity, and fiscal\n            constraints. The design and implementation of pilots to test\n            and fine-tune reforms and the establishment of\n            well-functioning management information system (MIS) and\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) systems are critical to\n            health and social assistance reform, as they can accommodate\n            learning, provide evidence of the feasibility and benefits\n            of such reform, and garner political support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Health System Modernization\n            Project and Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan

satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the Program was able to\n            achieve success because reforms spanned key areas of the\n            health care system starting with the stewardship functions\n            of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in health policy development\n            and the Health Insurance Institute (HII) in health financing\n            and provider payment reforms. The capacity of the Government\n            to absorb technical assistance and implement complex\n            institutional changes should be carefully evaluated to\n            ensure knowledge transfer and a sustainable impact of the\n            activities started under the Project. Close coordination and\n            collaboration with United States Agency for International\n            Development (USAID), World Health Organization (WHO), and\n            Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) in supporting\n            implementation aspects of the program helped keep key\n            activities on track and ensured complementarities of\n            interventions. Since both the PIU and the Bank have no\n            built-in capacity for the review of technical specifications\n            and bid evaluation reports of medical equipment, the launch\n            of procurement for medical equipment should allow more time\n            in the procurement plan for the review of bidding documents\n            and bid evaluation reports. Moreover, the bid validity\n            period should also be for a longer period to avoid extension\n            of bid validity period. The development and integration of\n            health information systems in the health sector is complex.\n            If a sector needs intervention in the implementation of a\n            new information system, it is important that there is a\n            specific team working on it right from the beginning of the\n            Project, and adequate time, resources, and attention should\n            be given on a priority basis. It will be important for the\n            Bank to find a way to keep supporting the follow-up actions\n            of the reforms introduced under the Project. Without a\n            follow-on project, the Bank will not have leverage with the\n            government regarding the reforms introduced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Health System Modernization
