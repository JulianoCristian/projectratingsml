Some lessons learned included: (i) the design\n            of a project and in particular of a pilot program should be\n            kept simple and within the capacity of the staff and\n            agencies responsible for its implementation. In this case\n            the project and the pilot were both too complex; (ii) the\n            implementation must be flexible to adapt to changes in the\n            environment - in this case the design of the Municipal Grant\n            Fund (MGF) was frequently adjusted to reflect lessons\n            learned which resulted in successfully testing a transfer\n            system that enabled local staff to design and implement\n            small projects within a 12 month cycle; (iii) the initial\n            mechanism to transfer of funds was complex because of an\n            unreliable treasury system at the time of the project's\n            design. However, since the current treasury system is well\n            established, future transfers to the municipalities should\n            be via the intergovernmental transfer system and not using\n            the mechanism tested in the pilot; (iv) the MGF pilot\n            developed in the third cycle a mechanism which included a\n            provision that contracts could only be signed when all\n            required funding was in place. This modification addressed\n            the counterpart funding problem and reduced the time to\n            completion dramatically; (v) increased involvement of the\n            staff in the implementing agencies in management of the\n            project would have helped to increase the local capacity\n            more than by utilizing outside implementing units for the\n            central and municipal governments; and (vi) the MGF had a\n            complex implementation framework involving too many decision\n            makers and which minimized the importance of local\n            ownership. If decentralized systems are to be successful,\n            they must have the active support and involvement of the\n            elected officials and staff from the local governments;\n            (vii) the lessons from the MDP and other projects show that\n            political leadership and commitment from the\n            mayors/presidents is a pre-condition for a successful\n            project design and management since the mayor has much\n            greater ownership and direct responsibility and\n            accountability; (viii) the involvement of WBI in the\n            implementation of component 2 was the major reason for the\n            improvement in that component and for the eventual impact of\n            the training program; (ix) The outcome of the MDP shows that\n            better coordinated efforts from GOM and partners for\n            capacity development is important and necessary; and (x) it\n            is essential for the team leaders for the government and\n            Bank project teams to develop a strong working relationship\n            built on effective communication to ensure the efforts of\n            both organizations are working toward the same objective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -

Although the overall\n            development objective remains realistic and achievable,\n            there are however a number of steps the Government needs to\n            take, to restructure the project, and ensure these\n            objectives are attained. This proposed amendment would: a)\n            increase the number of cities named in the project\n            development objective, and included in Component 3 -\n            Municipal Grants - from five to eight for the remainder of\n            the project; and b) specifically include provisions under\n            Component 4 - Project Management and Technical Assistance -\n            for consultancies to evaluate the pilot, and provide\n            recommendations to the Government for a future program that\n            would include all 33 municipalities. The proposed amendment\n            would incur no additional cost, yet it would enable a more\n            thorough evaluation of the pilot, that would be important to\n            scale-up the learning and benefits from the project as a\n            whole in the future. The increased number of municipalities\n            would scale-up immediate project impact for the design of a\n            future set of mechanisms for the Government, thus support\n            municipal development which depends crucially on careful\n            analysis of the pilot and lessons learned. The proposed\n            credit amendment complies with the Articles of Agreement of\n            the Association, and it is recommended for approval."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Municipal Development Project -\n            amendment to Credit Agreement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique -

The training will support\n            municipal government systems, and public administration,\n            emphasizing technical skills in municipal finance, and\n            infrastructure delivery

During the first phase of the\n            civil works program, the five municipalities (Beira,\n            Quelimane, Nampula, Pemba, and Maputo) will be limiting\n            their works to surface water drainage, sewerage and\n            sanitation, markets, waste disposal, and rehabilitation of\n            pavements and footpaths. 1) During construction, storage or\n            cement mixing sites will be located so that they do not\n            contaminate local water resources. Awareness campaigns\n            involving local communities will be promoted to keep\n            drainage channels clean and free of debris. 2) Measures will\n            be taken to ensure sanitary conditions are maintained at the\n            new markets. 3) Contractual obligations of the contractors\n            must include clauses regarding environmental protection,\n            especially regarding post-construction site-cleaning.\n            Latrines should not be constructed close to ground and\n            surface water sources to avoid contamination. 4) Local\n            population will be discouraged from using footpaths as\n            latrines, and adequate drainage will be provided to preclude\n            possible flooding and erosion. 5) Skips equipped with\n
