Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, the design of area\n            development projects needs to distinguish between\n            areas/activities where the market mechanism could bring\n            about an efficient allocation of resources and where it\n            cannot do so because of market failures or externalities.\n            Second, integration between different departments/agencies\n            is difficult but necessary and would be facilitated by the\n            close involvement of local communities in planning and\n            implementation. Third, appropriate technical packages must\n            be available before the start of a project. Fourth, a more\n            sustainable approach to rural development needs to be\n            developed. Fifth, the T & V system of extension needs to\n            be modified to local circumstances. Lastly, road design in\n            geologically fragile areas should incorporate features and\n            mechanical structures which minimize environmental damage\n            and reduce maintenance costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Integrated Hill Farming\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Integrated Hill\n            Farming
