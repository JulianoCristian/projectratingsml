sector in Bolivia, consisting of a supervised credit\n            program, survey of small mines and technical assistance to\n            participating institutions. Its overall cost is estimated at\n            US$18.2 million equivalent.

It is the third Bank Group financing\n            for the mining sector but the first one for small mining. Of\n            the total loan amount, US$9.0 million would be relent to the\n            Banco Minero de Bolivia (BAMIN) for financing mining\n            subprojects; US$1.9 million would be used for equipment and\n            technical assistance to the Bolivian Geological Service\n            (GEOBOL) to continue the survey of small mines, including\n            pre-investment studies, and provide technical assistance to\n            small miners; and US$1.1 million would be used for technical\n            assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Metallurgy (MMM) in\n            policy planning and cadastral survey and to BAMIN in project\n            evaluation and supervision.
