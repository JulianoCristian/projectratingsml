Some lessons learned included:\n            payment system projects are complex, and building\n            understanding, capacity and necessary consensus can not be\n            underestimated in terms of the time needed nor in terms of\n            financial resources especially in an eight country\n            sub-region. Before undertaking a technically and\n            managerially complex project, the Bank needs to place a\n            special emphasis on assuring that adequate institutional and\n            procurement capacity is in place. Finally, with the\n            Bank's current emphasis on access to finance, a payment\n            systems project today may be structured differently: such a\n            project will probably not only focus on improvements in\n            wholesale markets, i.e. systemically important, but also on\n            all segments of retail markets where emphasis may be less on\n            competition and more on cooperation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Western Africa - BCEAO Regional Payment\n            Systems Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Western Africa - BCEAO Regional\n

A secondary objective is that the new\n            payments systems satisfy internationally accepted standards\n            and core principles and thus ensure a high level of user\n            confidence in the WAEMU financial systems. The project has\n            five components: The project support component includes\n            project management and monitoring, training, and\n            procurement. The RTGS component establishes a real time\n            gross settlement system at the regional level, which\n            includes transaction monitoring, management of settlement\n            accounts, management of transactions queues, exchange of\n            information with participants, and intra-day liquidity\n            management. The low value clearing component upgrades\n            existing systems at the national and regional levels. The\n            inter-bank card system develops a common bank card product,\n            enabling use in any ATM or participating merchant's\n            facility in the sub-region. The project includes a\n            feasibility study on the use of e-money systems for small\n            payments. For all three payments systems in this project,\n            the BCEAO's telecommunications satellite network would\n            be used to effect transactions with a degree of security and\n            at low cost."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Western Africa -
