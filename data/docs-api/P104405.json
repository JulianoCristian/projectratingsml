Pre-paid Health Scheme Pilot in\n            Nigeria Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Pre-paid Health Scheme Pilot in\n            Nigeria Project received a moderately unsatisfactory outcome\n            performance with substantial risk to development outcome.\n            The Bank and the Borrower both received moderately\n            unsatisfactory performance ratings. The amounts allocated to\n            the project components were revised in June 2013 as follows:\n            a reallocation of funds from Category 1a (Insurance Premium\n            Subsidies) to a new Category 6 (medical services) and a\n            reallocation of funds for the implementation of the exit\n            strategy and for management cost from Category 1a (Insurance\n            Premium Subsidies) to Category 1b (Marketing Subsidies),\n            Category 2 (HIF Project Management), Category 3 (Monitoring\n            and Evaluation), and Category 4 (Audit). The project closing\n            date was also extended by nine months. The following seven\n            lessons were also learned from this project: (1) Integrating\n            impact evaluation in the design of an innovative pilot\n            project is critical for documenting lessons learned. If an\n            impact evaluation had been carried out, it would have helped\n            in understanding the counterfactual (i.e. what would have\n            happened in the absence of the project) (2) Coordination\n            with multi-levels of Government in the design and\n            implementation of community-based health insurance scheme is\n            key to ownership and financial sustainability. (3) In-depth\n            target group analysis during project preparation is\n            necessary to inform the project design, including\n            establishing the co-premium, selecting the appropriate\n            target group, and minimizing adverse selection, moral hazard\n            and other insurance risks. (4) Reviewing the acceptability\n            of premium rates and benefit packages for enrollment by\n            low-income employees (and their family members) at design\n            and during implementation is critical to increasing\n            enrollment and renewal rates. (5) Rating service providers\n            in the health insurance scheme network and monitoring\n            progress against quality improvement plans, contributes to\n            enhanced compliance with the service quality standards. (6)\n            Engaging expensive private hospitals for community based\n            health insurance scheme can lead to excess payments by the\n            health care management organization or lead to providers\n            prematurely dropping out of the scheme. (7) Developing a low\n            cost behavior change campaign and marketing strategy\n            stimulates enrollment and re-enrollment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Pre-paid Health Scheme Pilot

by implementing a health insurance scheme in\n            Nigeria. There are eight components to the project, the\n            first component being technical assistance for focus group\n            study. This study will document the characteristics of the\n            project's target group including: household\n            composition, employee wages, household income levels,\n            willingness and ability to pay, and potential uptake. The\n            second component is the subsidy. The subsidy component will\n            provide funding for the following output based components:\n            1) insurance premiums; 2) marketing; and 3) upgrading of two\n            service providers. The third component is the Health\n            Insurance Fund (HIF) project management. HIF will establish\n            an implementation, monitoring and evaluation agreement with\n            PharmAccess Foundation (PAF) govern the relationship for the\n            Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) project. The\n            fourth component is the monitoring and evaluation.\n            Monitoring and evaluation of the insurance program by PAF\n            consists of two activities: financial and medical reporting,\n            and quality assurance. The fifth component is the research.\n            The bio-medical research program is an optional component of\n            the scheme and has been included in this proposal at the\n            recommendation of GPOBA.  It consists of medical research on\n            the disease burden of the target population by the Center\n            for Poverty Related Communicable Diseases (CPCD). The sixth\n            component is the audits. Each party involved in the project\n            will be annually audited by an independent auditor to ensure\n            contractual compliance.  The seventh component is the World\n            Bank and GPOBA supervision.
