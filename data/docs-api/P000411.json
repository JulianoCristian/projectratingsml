The project\n            failed to achieve most of its objectives. The project's\n            scope was well beyond the Government's implementation\n            capacity. It was a highly risky endeavor in view of the\n            circumstances prevailing in Cameroon during the\n            implementation. The economic crisis of the late 1980s and\n            early 1990s severely undermined the social fabric in\n            Cameroon. The capacity of the construction industry was also\n            devastated, and therefore architectural firms and\n            contractors were unable to deliver their products. Some\n            basic lessons were drawn: 1) It is important to be realistic\n            concerning expectations and systems must be in place for\n            measuring performance. 2) Project design should be simple,\n            especially in sectors without prior experience in\n            Bank-financed projects. 3) No institutional assessments had\n            been carried out on ministries that are entrusted with\n            implementation. 4) Project implementation arrangements\n            should be in place prior to project approval. 5) All\n            stakeholders must be consulted. 6) Close Bank supervision\n            should be carried out with Bank managers involved in the process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
