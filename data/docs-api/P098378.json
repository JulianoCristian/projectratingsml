The\n            sustained success of the CBRD program as a whole reflects\n            its efforts to support the government's evolving vision\n            on decentralization. Achieving effective decentralization\n            requires sustained and holistic support to champions within\n            government and in civil society. Capacity building is more\n            effective when it focuses on sustainable institutions and\n            occurs through learning by doing. Involvement of the whole\n            community, especially the poor and marginalized, is\n            essential to ensure that ownership and commitment to local\n            development efforts are maintained. Communication and\n            collaboration are critical for ensuring community ownership\n            of project activities and social cohesion. Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M and E) information flows can become\n            overwhelming as a project's scale increases, its\n            activities evolve, and new lessons continually emerge. A\n            programmatic approach, with adequate flexibility to\n            incorporate innovations and sufficient technical assistance\n            for piloting and testing at each stage, is a key success\n            factor for building the confidence of staff and communities,\n            helping to fine-tune the model, and enhancing the prospects\n            for achieving development
