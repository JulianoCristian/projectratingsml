Urban population in the country grew\n            considerably during the 1960s to about forty (40) percent of\n            the total population. As a result the education system was\n            well developed and relatively advanced; however, its output\n            lacked specialists and technicians. This education project\n            will reduce the urban workforce shortage in important\n            economic sectors like transportation and manufacturing and\n            improve the quality of primary and secondary education. The\n            country\u0092s interregional transport center accounts for about\n            fifty (50) percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and\n            manufacturing services account for about fifteen (15)\n            percent of the GDP. The government of the Republic of Congo\n            is concerned about skilled personnel to secure proper\n            operation of existing infrastructure, as well as assure the\n            implementation of planned investments in the future. This\n            education project does not involve the sixty (60) percent of\n            the population that subsides on agriculture, working in\n            forestry, a sector that provides tax incentive to the government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Partial Transcript of meeting of the\n            Executive Directors of the IBRD and IDA, held on Tuesday,\n            March 16, 1971 : Republic of Congo - Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Partial Transcript of meeting of\n            the Executive Directors of the IBRD and IDA, held on\n            Tuesday, March 16, 1971 : Republic of Congo - Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1971/03/17878996/partial-transcript-meeting-executive-directors-ibrd-ida-held-tuesday-march-16-1971-republic-congo-education-project","projn":"CG-Education-266441 -- P000539","subtopic":"Sustainable Land and Crop Management,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Debt Markets","docty":"Transcript","teratopic":"Rural Development,Transport,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Congo, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20130618122517"},"subsc":"Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Board transcript","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Transport,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural education, agriculture,\n            concession, developing country, economic development,\n            expenditure, expenditures, financial difficulties, foreign\n            exchange, forestry, government account, INTERNATIONAL BANK,\n            INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, marketing, negotiations, public\n            investments, public savings, railroad, railway, railway\n            system, roads, small farmers, tax, tax revenues, transit,\n            transit services, transit system, transport, transportation, wood"}},"owner":"WB Off: Yaounde-Central Africa 1 (AFCC1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"78523"},"15580032":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1971/03/15580032/congo-education-project-congo-projet-educatif","available_in":"English,French","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"English","entityid":"000178830_98101903205287","node_id":"15580032"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1971/03/15580032/congo-education-project-congo-projet-educatif","new_url":"1971/03/15580032/congo-education-project-congo-projet-educatif","disclosure_date":"2011-12-26T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-08-27T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-08-27T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b0828ba572","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0828ba572","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/08/27/090224b0828ba572/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/Congo000Projet00ducatif.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/08/27/090224b0828ba572/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Congo000Projet00ducatif.pdf","docdt":"1971-03-03T14:41:00Z","datestored":"2011-12-26T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Congo - Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Education Project for Congo consists\n            of: (a) the construction, furnishing, and equipping of: (i)\n            an Elementary Vocational Training Center; (ii) a Technician\n            Training Institute; (iii) 10 laboratories as additions to\n            two Senior Secondary General Schools; and (iv) an Elementary\n            Teacher Training College.
