Three lessons were cited: 1) Decentralization\n            requires an enabling institutional environment including: a\n            long term commitment, a demand-driven approach including\n            beneficiary contributions, clear institutional roles and\n            guidance for all stakeholders, and a common implementation\n            modality for all actors. 2) A major drive to build\n            implementation capacity is essential including: major\n            training for local governments, communities and private\n            sector support services, emphasis on up-front capacity\n            building before investment in infrastructure, strong central\n            coordination including monitoring and evaluation, and\n            integration of hygiene education alongside the investment\n            program; and 3)  Sustainability needs to be a central focus\n            including: priority on raising revenues for operations and\n            maintenance, institutional adjustments to improve revenue\n            collection, self-sustaining support services from the\n            private sector, and follow-on training for the local\n            governments and community organizations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

Village Infrastructure Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings convey a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, with high institutional\n            development impacts, and, satisfactory performances by the\n            Bank and Borrower. The following are some lessons of\n            experience: 1) The project utilized a large number of\n            indicators, which were not always easy to measure, and did\n            not promote efficiency in the management of the project.\n            This reflects the trend that projects formulated more\n            recently have a) fewer and b) easier-to-measure indicators.\n            2) For community-driven development (CDD) projects,\n            micro-project implementation depends on demand from\n            communities. It is therefore difficult, and sometimes\n            self-defeating, to predict the quantity of micro-projects\n            that communities will request. The targets predicted are\n            difficult to attain, or alternatively, can be substantially\n            exceeded; this is mitigated by reviewing the indicators as\n            projects progress, or, at Mid-term Review (MTR). On the\n            other hand, the indicators chosen can be just qualitative in\n            nature. 3) A large amount of capacity building and training\n            is essential, even in an infrastructure project, to ensure\n            optimal use of the infrastructure provided. Without\n            institutional strengthening and capacity building, a project\n            can fail in its original objectives (e.g. a dam built for\n            irrigation can be used for drinking water only, making\n            sub-optimal use of a large investment). This demonstrates\n            that infrastructure development alone cannot lead to\n            sustainability. The project demonstrated that approximately\n            half of recipients are able to carry out their own planning,\n            and subprojects as a result of the training provided by the\n            project. However, the remaining half requires additional\n            training, and, institutional strengthening and capacity\n            building also led to communities taking control of their\n            development. Other lessons address, and/or reinforce the\n            importance of project ownership, of maintenance planning,\n            and, of an integrated water, sanitation, and hygiene education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

(2) Rural Transport Infrastructure - selectively\n            rehabilitating and improving degraded feeder roads;\n            developing village trails and tracks linking farms to\n            villages to permit the use of simple wheeled vehicles to\n            reduce the need for women and children to head carry\n            weights; and a pilot program to develop intermediate means\n            for the rural poor to convey goods to market. (3) Rural\n            Post-Harvest Infrastructure - developing on-farm and\n            village-level drying facilities to reduce post-harvest\n            losses; on-farm and community storage and other\n            village-level market infrastructure for more efficient\n            marketing; appropriate facilities for processing crops,\n            livestock and fisheries products to increase their quality\n            shelflife and market value; and income-generating activities\n            targeted at the poorest. (4) Institutional Strengthening -\n            capacity building within district assemblies to strengthen\n            their planning and financial management of rural\n            infrastructure; strengthening NGOs and other community-based\n            organizations to provide more effective implementation\n            support to communities and groups in developing sustainable\n            rural infrastructure; and empowering beneficiary\n            associations and groups to take direct responsibility for\n            the sustainable operations and maintenance of rural

This environmental\n            assessment identifies potential environmental concerns and\n            provides appropriate environmental guidelines for mitigation\n            measures. In the water project subcomponents, contamination\n            of surface and ground waters can be mitigated by conducting\n            regular quality analyses.  Lined canals or pipes can be used\n            to prevent disease vectors and seepage.  Ground water\n            depletion can be reduced by ensuring that abstraction rates\n            are consistent with natural aquifer recharge.  Reducing\n            farming activities upstream can reduce sedimentation and\n            discourage aquatic weed growth.  Salinisation may be\n            controlled by leaching of salts through periodic flushing or\n            soils.  In terms of rural transport infrastructure, road\n            surface should be sealed with bitumen to avoid erosion.\n            Frequent watering can reduce dust impacts.  Appropriate\n            culverts and drifts can be used to eliminate flooding.  Axle\n            loads of trucks should be regulated to avoid depressions and\n            ponding.  As for the rural post-harvest infrastructure, some\n            of the solid waste generated by processing equipment could\n            be recycled.  Liquid waste should be analyzed to determined\n            possible uses. The use of mud silos provides protection to\n            dry crops and prevents bush fires."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Village Infrastructure Project :\n            environmental
