The lessons\n            learned include:  (1) The choice of implementing agency and\n            of project coordinator is key to the successful\n            implementation of a complex project involving several\n            countries and partner; (2) Obtaining government commitment\n            during project preparation to specific arrangements for\n            institutional and financial sustainability, and continuing\n            to focus on the issue during implementation, helps to ensure\n            that project investments will be sustained after the project\n            closes; (3) Building effective partnerships with relevant\n            organizations, industry, and governments of non-beneficiary\n            countries can help significantly improve project design and\n            implementation; (4) Being clear early during project\n            preparation on the scope and nature of partners'\n            participation can help prevent conflicts later; and (5)\n            Pairing weaker countries with stronger ones in a regional\n            project can help to quickly build the capacity of the weaker ones."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa -

The first of five\n            components assists the four countries in upgrading their\n            national legislative framework to accede to the relevant\n            covenants and protocols by sponsoring a regional workshop on\n            convention ratification and implementation; and providing\n            expert consultants.

The third component evaluates\n            local handling facilities, anticipates an accident scenario,\n            appraises local and climatic conditions, creates a response\n            strategy, identifies equipment, and provides training. The\n            fourth component builds national capacity by designing and\n            holding expert-led workshops and an expert-developed and\n            tested response manual, providing training, and funding\n            government participation in international seminars.
