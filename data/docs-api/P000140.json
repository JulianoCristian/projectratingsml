In general the bank's\n            performance was good. However, on the procurement issue the\n            Bank became involved in considerable discussion with the\n            consultants on details of design which delayed the project\n            by some months and caused some increase of costs.\n            Financially the results have been better than expected and\n            are likely to continue so. The Government is now in a\n            position to divert new industries to the Francistown area\n            thus relieving the pressure on the water resources of the\n            Gaborone area. If there is a lesson to be learned from this\n            project, it is that where an efficient and experienced\n            agency initiates and designs a project with the aid of\n            reputable consultants having the benefit of local knowledge\n            and experience, the Bank should hesitate to initiate changes\n            unless there are manifestly good reasons for doing so. In\n            this case the estimated marginal financial benefits\n            resulting from the changes initiated by the Bank have to be\n            weighed against the unquantifiable costs of delay in\n            completing the project. Moreover, if the agency and their\n            consultants' judgment were sound in choosing the\n            original design, even the estimated marginal financial\n            benefits may prove to be ephemeral."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana -

The\n            Project would meet Francistown's water requirements\n            until 1988/89, and would raise water quality to\n            international standards. The Project faces no technical\n            risks, but WUC would have to raise tariffs substantially\n            from existing levels to recover project costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana - Second Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Botswana -
