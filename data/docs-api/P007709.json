place funds required for\n            credit enhancement, in connection with the Debt Reduction\n            Plan. The external financing requirement of the Government\n            would be covered through the Plan for 1989-94, thus helping\n            support the Government's adjustment program, further\n            structural reforms and the resumption of sustained economic\n            growth. The proposed loan would help achieve a debt relief\n            of 24 percent after the interest recapture allowance. This\n            is achieved by reducing both amortization and interest\n            payments. Reduced net transfers abroad would enable the\n            Government to recover sustainable growth, while concluding\n            the stabilization and adjustment programs.
