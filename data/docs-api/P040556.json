The performances of\n            both the Bank and the Borrower are rated satisfactory. The\n            design and implementation of the project offers the\n            following considerations that might be useful in shaping\n            future projects of this nature: Legal covenants should be\n            carefully worded to allow adequate flexibility in their\n            achievement. An efficient road sector requires the\n            acceptance and adoption of key principles that may be put in\n            place through different mechanisms and under different types\n            of administrations. Among these principles are the need to\n            maintain the quality and serviceability of infrastructure\n            assets through adequate funding, up to date technical\n            capabilities and efficient use of scarce resources and, for\n            the use of public monies, transparency and accountability.\n            The design and implementation of projects in the road sector\n            should give equal or more weight to the issue of quality of\n            expenditures rather than to the issue of quantity of\n            expenditures. Considering that quality issues involve\n            substantial changes in the institutional culture which\n            seldom originate within the road agency, weaknesses in those\n            areas should be brought to the attention of major\n            stakeholders who might have an interest in securing that the\n            increased amount of funding proposed under a project is used\n            wisely. Sector Policy Notes or some other form of sector\n            work, could be an ideal instrument to engage the new\n            government in a meaningful dialogue on sector issues and the\n            role of a project (and future projects) in addressing them.\n            It would provide a strategic blue print or road map for the\n            sector that would help avoid costly mistakes and\n            backtracking, and bring forward those areas that are\n            becoming serious bottlenecks in institutional development\n            (e.g. inadequate university programs, lack of career\n            development incentives, etc). Engaging different\n            stakeholders in a long term vision for the sector would also\n            serve as a cost-effective way to raise awareness of the work\n            ahead and contribute to generate well focused demand driven\n            technical assistances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia -

comprises\n            urgent periodic road repair, rehabilitation, and\n            reconstruction. The proposed project rating is in\n            Environmental Category B. Such rehabilitation and\n            maintenance projects as this, offer more efficient vehicle\n            operation and a corresponding reduction in pollutant\n            emissions, noise and vibrations from traffic, and the\n            opportunity to offer mitigation of anticipated adverse\n            impacts. Direct negative impacts in this project will arise\n            from 1) producing and applying bituminous products; 2)\n            quarrying stone and gravel 3) causing noise, dust, and\n            traffic disruptions because of construction; and 4)\n            designing and placing drains, which leads to surface\n            erosion. These concerns will be addressed thus:\n            Environmental guidelines will be issued to asphalt plants,\n            which must meet certification requirements to receive\n            project contracts. Similarly, all quarry and crushing sites\n            must obtain certification and all contractors will be\n            required to use materials taken only from licensed sites.\n            All contractors will attend training in construction\n            management and road maintenance as a prerequisite to bidding\n            eligibility. Contract documents will specify that the\n            contractors undertake work site mitigation actions detailed\n            in the bidding documents. Drainage improvements will be\n            considered in project design.

The proposed project rating is in\n            Environmental Category B. Such rehabilitation and\n            maintenance projects as this, offer more efficient vehicle\n            operation and a corresponding reduction in pollutant\n            emissions, noise and vibrations from traffic, and the\n            opportunity to offer mitigation of anticipated adverse\n            impacts. Direct negative impacts in this project will arise\n            from 1) producing and applying bituminous products; 2)\n            quarrying stone and gravel 3) causing noise, dust, and\n            traffic disruptions because of construction; and 4)\n            designing and placing drains, which leads to surface\n            erosion. These concerns will be addressed thus:\n            Environmental guidelines will be issued to asphalt plants,\n            which must meet certification requirements to receive\n            project contracts. Similarly, all quarry and crushing sites\n            must obtain certification and all contractors will be\n            required to use materials taken only from licensed sites.\n            All contractors will attend training in construction\n            management and road maintenance as a prerequisite to bidding\n            eligibility. Contract documents will specify that the\n            contractors undertake work site mitigation actions detailed\n            in the bidding documents.
