Some lessons learned included: flexibility of\n            project design, particularly in emergency operations\n            facilitates implementation and provides a greater\n            opportunity for achieving project objectives. Training,\n            continuous social mobilization, and effective strategic\n            communications are critical for the success of projects and\n            consolidation of gains. Development of operational manuals\n            and their official notification by the government and\n            implementing agency clarifies the roles and responsibilities\n            of multiple players and partners involved in the program and\n            facilitate smooth implementation. Effective planning in the\n            areas of logistics and material supply play a vital role in\n            the success of emergency response and reconstruction\n            projects. Third-party technical audits, independent\n            financial audits, and eligibility surveys in addition to\n            existing government mechanisms are good tools for reducing\n            the risks associated with governance issues and increase the\n            transparency and credibility of program. The home owner\n            driven approach with necessary technical assistance allows\n            affected communities to develop ownership of the program and\n            yields results. In the case of emergency operations, the\n            effects of the disaster on government and implementing\n            agencies with respect to their capacities should not be\n            underestimated and project targets and implementation period\n            should be planned and designed accordingly. Joint strategic\n            planning and coordination amongst different donors,\n            especially after disasters, allows for a more effective\n            response through avoiding overlaps and addressing priority\n            areas to the benefit of the country and its affected\n            population. Effective grievance redressal mechanisms and\n            documentation are essential for addressing the concerns and\n            issues of beneficiaries and allowing for smooth\n            implementation of the program. An effective reporting,\n            monitoring and evaluation system is essential for enabling\n            informed decision making at both policy and operational levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri

Restore basic\n            services to the affected population; and (iii) Start the\n            recovery and reconstruction process. IDA carried out a\n            portfolio restructuring to release up to US$50 million and\n            provisionally set aside US$25 million to provide immediate\n            financing for urgent tsunami-related reconstruction efforts.\n            This proposed follow-up operation for the Tsunami Emergency\n            Recovery Operation, Phase II will continue the financing\n            initiated under the Phase I restructuring. It is anticipated\n            that other donors would be identified in the near future to\n            support some of these priority needs. If other donors were\n            to provide grant funds to finance any activity earmarked for\n            support by IDA credits, IDA resources will not be used."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Tsunami Emergency Recovery\n            Program - Second Phase"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Tsunami Emergency\n            Recovery Program - Second Phase"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5606491/sri-lanka-tsunami-emergency-recovery-program-second-phase","projn":"LK-Sri Lanka Tsunami Erl -- P094205","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Urban Services to the Poor,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050216110825"},"subsc":"General education sector,Housing construction,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Industry and trade,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, Accounting, Accounting\n            Standards, asbestos, auditing, communities, councils,\n            disasters, disease surveillance, education outcomes,\n            Electricity, Epidemiology, ethnic groups, families,\n            feasibility studies, Financial Accountability, Financial\n            Management, Financial Regulations, Gross Domestic Product,\n            Hazards, health care, health facilities, health needs,\n            Health Sector, health services, hospitals, Housing,\n            implementation strategies, Indigenous Peoples, information\n            dissemination, institutional capacity, land management, land\n            use, local authorities, local governments, management\n            information systems, managers, Needs Assessment, ports,\n            Procurement, project implementation, public health, public\n            sector, public works, quality control, rabies, Refugees,\n            rehabilitation, Roads, Safety, sanitation, savings, schools,\n            Screening, service delivery, single parents, social issues,\n            social networks, social welfare, Technical Assistance,\n            telecommunications, tertiary education, transparency,\n            unemployment, unemployment rate, victims, wages, water\n            supply, widows, workers"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"T7650"},"facets":{}}}
