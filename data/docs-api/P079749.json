Some lessons learned included: the\n            difficulties experienced in the implementation of certain\n            project activities are primarily those of a regional nature.\n            The implementation of an activity involving a number of\n            countries requires a special approach and a lot longer\n            because dependent on the political will; the project\n            promoted dialogue between different stakeholders involved in\n            the project, which is the basis for the improvement of\n            social and functional relationships between them. For\n            example customs and freight forwarders, carriers and truck\n            drivers recognized that the project was an opportunity for\n            rapprochement between them; the humps, which were introduced\n            as part of the project to ensure road safety in the\n            Ouaga-Sakoins\u00e9 section, have reduced the number of deaths on\n            the stretch; and the improvement of customs procedures and\n            documentary processing at the Tema port and border crossing\n            ports through training and equipment supply has improved\n            customs and port operations to some extent with regards to\n            reduced delays. This has facilitated intra-regional trade\n            and contributed towards increased Trade within the\n            sub-region as benefits of increased trading are already\n            being gained.

(Additional information to complete the\n            request was submitted electronically on January 31, 2013.)\n            The reallocation of credit proceeds is necessary for the\n            following reasons: First, to prevent the continued\n            substantial delays in the release of counterpart funds from\n            GoG by increasing the financing parameters from 92.5 percent\n            to 100 percent for the civil works components (categories\n            one, three, and five of the financing agreement); and\n            secondly, to re-allocate the credit proceeds from categories\n            eight and two to categories one, four, five and six to fund\n            additional costs for the civil works activities of the Ghana\n            component of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - West Africa Road Transport\n            and Transit Facilitation Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa Region - West Africa Road\n            Transport and Transit Facilitation Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/04/18805982/africa-region-west-africa-road-transport-transit-facilitation-project-restructuring","projn":"3A-West Africa Regional Transport And\n            Transit Facilitation Project -- P079749","subtopic":"Rural Roads & Transport,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Airports and Air Services,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business","docty":"Project Paper","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20140116104410"},"theme":"Regional integration,Trade facilitation and market access","subsc":"Central government administration,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways,Other social services,Health,General transportation sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plan, capacity building, cargo, civil\n            works, civil works component, construction, corridor,\n            Corridor transport, Customs, Financing Plan, Highway,\n            Highway Authority, ICT, ID, Implementing Agency, Information\n            Communication, Information Communication Technology,\n            Infrastructures, IP, Project management, REGIONAL TRANSPORT,\n            Road, Road Infrastructure, road safety, road safety action,\n            road sector, road works, Satellite, Technical Assistance,\n            Technology Implementation, tracking system, traffic,\n            TRANSIT, transport authorities, Transport Sector"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF053319-PHRD-WEST AFRICA: WEST AFRICA\n            ROAD TRANSPORT","majtheme":"Trade and integration","repnb":"74378"},"facets":{}}}
