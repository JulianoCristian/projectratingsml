Bank performance and borrower performance are\n            unsatisfactory. Among the lessons cited were: (a) In such\n            difficult sector circumstances, the lack of an adequate risk\n            analysis with careful assessment of the borrower's\n            implementation capacity and commitment to reform was\n            particularly costly. (b) The Project should not have been\n            started when the judiciary's governance structure may\n            have been undergoing a substantial change. Neither should\n            the Bank have persisted in pushing a project when there was\n            lack of commitment from the authorities responsible for its\n            execution. (c) In the light of the two aforementioned\n            points, the key prerequisites for future Bank-supported\n            judicial activity in Argentina should include (1) a clear\n            project concept and design; (2) a strong understanding by\n            the judicial authorities of the project's concept and\n            objectives; (3) the assurance of adequate independence for\n            the judiciary for the task; (4) assurance of adequate\n            \"ownership\" of the proposed design and work plan;\n            (5) provisions for building project execution capabilities\n            in the courts; (6) a realistic time frame; and (7) selection\n            of a good lending instrument. (d) The design and supervision\n            of computerized systems intended for integrated management\n            improvements need to be closely monitored."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Model Court Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina -

The project's\n            components are three. The first, Court Management, reviews\n            the organization and court and case management of the\n            seventeen model courts. It has two subcomponents. The first\n            develops administration policies and strategies between the\n            different levels of the judiciary; finalizes the court\n            management plan and prepares studies; and designs case\n            management procedures incorporating operational standards\n            and statistics which verify and control changes being\n            implemented. The second subcomponent develops a permanent\n            solution to reduce the number of pending cases within the\n            selected courts. The second component improves the skill\n            levels within the court system for both judges and court\n            personnel in court administration and case management by\n            developing an education policy and training judges and court\n            personnel. The third component comprises outreach activities\n            and a number of reviews to evaluate the results of the model\n            courts by creating judicial information centers, conducting\n            user opinion surveys, disseminating information to the\n            public, and evaluating the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
