The principal\n            objective of these programs is to promote a vigorous\n            recovery of the economy through renewed export-led growth,\n            with particular emphasis on expanding exports to third\n            markets outside the Central American Common Market (CACM).\n            The main areas covered by the first phase of the\n            Government's medium-term program include: (a) initial\n            changes in the trade regime as part of a process to reduce\n            effective protection and provide increased incentives to\n            exports; and (b) steps to curtail further growth of the\n            public sector and improve the efficiency of public sector\n            institutions and programs. Subsequent phases of the\n            Structural Adjustment Program would concentrate on further\n            reducing effective protection, improving the efficiency of\n            the banking system, and strengthening the policy and\n            incentive framework in agriculture. The loan would finance\n            all imports, with the exception of luxury items and military goods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Structural Adjustment Loan
