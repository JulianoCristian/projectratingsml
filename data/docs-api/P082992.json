Some lessons learned\n            included: capacity building with a\n            perception-and-behavior-change approach at the both national\n            and provincial levels guarantees project sustainability.\n            This was a pioneering project trying to achieve change in a\n            complex institutional environment with little practical\n            example to follow. Capacity building in policy and\n            regulatory framework establishment and enforcement,\n            effective organization of public awareness raising\n            activities, accurate and practical Integrated Pest\n            Management (IPM) technical knowledge education, and\n            institutional management with improved IT technologies are\n            crucial for making changes for this type of project. The\n            provincial Project Implementation Units (PIUs) played a key\n            role in coordinating with local government agencies and\n            following up on project activities, which was a key factor\n            for ultimate project success. Undertaking in-depth needs\n            assessment is required to ensure project is accurately\n            designed to directly respond to local needs. Based on past\n            ten-year termite threats in the selected provinces, the\n            project was initially designed to procure 900,000 bait\n            systems, of which 500,000 are above-ground and 400,000\n            in-ground. It was found during installation that the\n            proportion of the two types was inappropriate, leaving a\n            huge gap between real and designed demands. Miscalculation\n            in project design leads to frequent component adjustment,\n            significantly impeding implementation and lengthening\n            project development period for one year. In addition, given\n            that procured above-ground systems largely exceeded local\n            demands for termite control, termite control stations in\n            demonstration areas intentionally neglected instructions\n            when installing these systems at an early stage so that they\n            can finish their tasks on time. Impact analysis and the\n            integration in project design of mechanisms for generating\n            new solutions are needed when confronted with higher\n            operational costs derived from the application of new technologies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Demonstration of Alternatives to\n            Chlordane and Mirex in Termite Control
