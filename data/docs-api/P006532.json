The performances of the\n            Borrower and the Bank are rated satisfactory. Despite lots\n            of efforts both on the federal Government and Bank sides, no\n            immediate solution could be found to resolve fiscal\n            difficulties and weak political coordination. While during\n            project preparation, risks associated with these two issues\n            should have been evaluated more in depth, and specific\n            mitigation measures proposed, it also appears that there is\n            a limit to how such issues can effectively be handled in the\n            framework of a Bank operation. The question should be asked\n            as to whether, in a difficult political context, Bank\n            operations should be focusing on narrower, but still\n            well-justified objectives, for which there is a broad\n            political consensus, and a clear path to achieve them. The\n            question is also whether a traditional investment approach\n            can still be considered as adequate, when supporting a\n            Borrower working with fully-funded budgets with high-levels\n            of earmarking, and facing cash flow management difficulties.\n            Instead, the use of innovative approaches (such as a\n            sector-wide approach with, when feasible, use of country\n            systems) seems to be more promising, based on early results\n            to date at the federal level. Finally, the relevance of a\n            program-based approach could also be questioned. Second, the\n            weaker the political coordination, the higher the need to\n            build, thin project design, incentives to foster\n            Government-wide interest in a successful project\n            implementation. Third, the execution of the project\n            confirmed the efficiency of result-based contracts for road\n            maintenance and rehabilitation contracts, even in a\n            fiscally-constrained environment, with respect to the\n            following: (a) rehabilitation works followed by maintenance\n            services within the same contract, partially addresses the\n            chronic lack of network maintenance, and improves the\n            contractor's accountability with respect to\n            rehabilitation works; (b) contract flexibility accommodates\n            large variations in the client's payment capacity; (c)\n            result-based contracts allow for simpler but more efficient\n            supervision of contract execution; (d) longer term contracts\n            and transfer of responsibility of final design to the\n            contractor are perceived to lower the contractor's\n            risks; and (e) contracts covering longer extension of road\n            sections, for longer periods of time significantly reduce\n            the number of procurement processes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

Specific objectives are to: 1) rehabilitate\n            federal highways; 2) decentralize highway responsibilities\n            to state governments; 3) increase the participation of the\n            private sector in the management and financing of highways\n            through concessions and maintenance management contracts;\n            and 4) strengthen the capabilities of the National Roads\n            Department and the State Road Departments to prepare,\n            contract and monitor efficient network rehabilitation and\n            maintenance programs and highway concession projects. The\n            project will consist of three main components: (a) highway\n            decentralization, including: (i) technical assistance and\n            training services; and (ii) state
