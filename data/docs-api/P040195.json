Due to the fact that strong\n            institutional development is a key benefit for implementing\n            competitive-funding mechanisms in higher education, the Bank\n            and future borrowers should endeavor to develop indicators\n            that better monitor qualitative aspects of organizational\n            behaviors, that can help identify the loci of institutional\n            change, and that better measure factors such as\n            institutional autonomy, transparency, accountability, and efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
