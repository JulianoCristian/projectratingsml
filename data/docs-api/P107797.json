Some lessons learned included: a)\n            where there is a reasonable likelihood of policy continuity,\n            it is important for the Bank to seize opportunities to help\n            governments accelerate reform implementation. While country\n            circumstances will vary and, inevitably, each country will\n            exhibit highly specific characteristics, the reality is that\n            opportunities for advancing reform are often fleeting; b)\n            the Bank's operational flexibility enabled it to meet a\n            number of objectives. Macro stability was bolstered with the\n            provision of budget support. This had a larger importance,\n            given the efforts to return the country to democracy through\n            holding a credible election. Sector reform has been helped\n            as well, though specific areas supported by the Development\n            Policy Credit (DPC) show different levels of achievement,\n            the overall direction of reform is being maintained; and c)\n            it is critical, when doing one-off Development Policy\n            Lending's (DPLs), that reform areas to be supported are\n            areas of general interest and involvement going forward,\n            ideally with a direct link to Bank operations, whether\n            through investment lending or technical assistance. The\n            engagement that the Bank team had on these issues was\n            critical in the build-up to the power DPC, and has been\n            critical in the results that have been achieved to date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Power Sector Development Policy\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Power Sector\n            Development Policy
