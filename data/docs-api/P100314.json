Some lessons learned included: a basket-fund\n            approach helps to harmonize donor assistance and combine the\n            different funding resources into a single package. This\n            simplifies the coordination process; makes project\n            implementation more efficient and maximize the development\n            impact. The prerequisite for such an approach to work is\n            that there are multiple development partners and they share\n            a common goal, regardless of the sector or country where an\n            operation is carried out. The downside is that it could\n            increase the inflexibility of the project in the event\n            structural changes are needed. In order to achieve the best\n            results in a sector or subsector, an operation needs to\n            target both the operational side as well as the policy side.\n            In the TMP project, the main target was Tanzania Revenue\n            Authority (TRA), but tax policies were actually set by the\n            Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs (MoFEA). There are\n            also other stakeholders involved in implementing the tax\n            system reforms, such as the Bank of Tanzania and the\n            Tanzania Planning Commission. A holistic approach will help\n            better achieve both the operational and policy objectives.\n            If an operation substantially involves Information and\n            Communications Technology (ICT) infrastructure, it is\n            important to have an overall system strategy and demand\n            forecasting before implementation. This will help to ensure\n            seamless integration among different parts of the system,\n            thereby maximizing efficiency gains and avoiding rapid\n            depletion of system capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Tax Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Tax Modernization
