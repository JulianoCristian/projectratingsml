Some lessons learned included: The project\n            approach and the implementation procedures of the local\n            investment fund (LIF) were very critical to give more\n            responsibility to the different actors, those of government\n            institutions, but particularly at the community level. This\n            allowed a better ownership of local investments and will\n            therefore increase awareness for appropriate maintenance and\n            sustainability. The approach has proven that if local\n            communities have been given the opportunity, they are\n            capable to manage their own development and be at the center\n            of the decision-making process. In addition, the active\n            involvement of the government institutions in the project\n            implementation contributed widely to their capacity\n            development and will ensure the sustainability of the\n            results achieved. The execution of community based programs\n            necessitates a good knowledge of local conditions and the\n            adoption of simple management procedures. Without a minimum\n            of flexibility regarding for example the direct transfer of\n            funds to communities and the confidence on self control\n            mechanisms on funds disbursement, it will not be possible to\n            execute a large number of micro-projects in a short term period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Community-Based Rural\n

Burkina Faso is\n            essentially a semi-arid, but also an agricultural country,\n            thus its fragile natural resource base, and extensive\n            farming practices are accelerating its degradation. It is\n            imperative that the assessment be implemented at the\n            earliest stages of subproject implementation, and that\n            beneficiaries be trained, introducing at the same time\n            improved sanitation practices at the village level. An\n            awareness campaign should limit shallow pollution, and\n            inappropriate waste disposal. It is expected that\n            construction of rural, and feeder roads through forest, and\n            pastoral zones, in addition to small-scale dams, and piped\n            water systems for large villages, will adversely impact the\n            environment. Mitigating measures follow. Project\n            construction call for the elimination of lateral ditches\n            along the road, instead, new water channels would enhance\n            water accessibility to local populations. Construction\n            material will be humidified to prevent dust pollution, and\n            re-vegetation will prevent soil erosion. Improved drainage\n            infrastructure should restore water transfers, regulating\n            the wetlands, and, the downstream portion of road drainage\n            should prevent accelerated formation of gullies, and erosion\n            alongside. Although the engineering design will limit\n            deforestation, and vegetative losses, ecosystems and wetland\n            management will ensure tree planting and re-vegetation as needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -
