A more realistic rating of the\n            project outcome would be \"more than satisfactory\"\n            considering the Highly Satisfactory rating as the top of the\n            scale. This is so because all project development objectives\n            were met as shown in Section 4, the outcomes are likely to\n            be sustainable, and in particular, the institutional impact\n            of the project was high. However, conservatively it is rated\n            as Satisfactory. Key lessons are hereby summarized.\n            Concerning Subproject selection and design, and in order to\n            maximize the benefits and returns to irrigation and drainage\n            (I&D) rehabilitation investments: a) highest priority\n            should be given to areas with the more favorable\n            agro-climatic conditions for increasing crop productivity;\n            b) the lower cost in I&D system rehabilitation works,\n            covering a large area and a large number of beneficiaries,\n            should be selected; and, the nature of a rehabilitation\n            project is such, that the condition of an I&D system may\n            change during the time period, from the date of preliminary\n            project selection up to the actual start of construction.\n            Consequently, the designs, construction contracts, and\n            budget allocations need to be flexible enough to accommodate\n            the inevitable changes required. As per the development of\n            Water Users' Associations (WUAs), it is stipulated that\n            adequate resources, consulting services, and time for\n            technical assistance have to be provided under the Project\n            to establish the WUAs, as well as to provide them with\n            support after I&D rehabilitation to initiate the\n            agricultural production activities, and achieve the\n            system's adequate operation and maintenance (O&M).\n            Consequently for this type of investment, this would mean an\n            implementation period longer than the usual five years. And,\n            in looking at the implementation/organizational\n            arrangements, it is mentioned that incorporating the\n            Committee of Water Resources (CWR) into the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MOA) and transferring I&D responsibility\n            back to CWR, corrected a long standing institutional anomaly\n            in the management of the water sector in the country, and,\n            CWR is, therefore, in a strong position to manage\n            investments for I&D system improvements. Finally,\n            lessons regarding cost recovery indicate that a rational\n            approach should be used for defining the on-farm and\n            off-farm works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -
