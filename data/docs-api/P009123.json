Lessons convey\n            that: 1) technical assistance (TA) projects, particularly in\n            countries of recent Bank experience, require ample time for\n            implementation, in order to allow for an effective transfer\n            of skills; 2) retaining implementation of the Family Budget\n            Survey (FBS) (not until the project's second extension\n            did the FBS take place) proved wrong, not only causing\n            funding, and implementation delays, but had it not been\n            carried out, substantial data to establish a meaningful\n            profile of the Uzbekistan economy, would have been\n            unavailable; 3) in retrospect, the impact of the project was\n            diminished, or barely visible, because it was not linked to\n            a policy operation, and therefore, achieved little leverage\n            in the reform program; 4) operations with significant\n            equipment financing, should particularly consider - at the\n            design stage - the sustainability of project activities\n            beyond the life of the project, for measures to enhance\n            sustainability of equipment supply, and maintenance were not\n            incorporated, neither is there any strategic approach to\n            lessen the dependency on further procurement support; and,\n            5) the legal TA component would have been more effective,\n            had local professionals been extensively consulted,\n            consequently certain legal results proved unsatisfactory to\n            the
