Some lessons learned included:\n            ensuring the sustainability of the community-based\n            Integrated Ecosystem Management (IEM) approach requires\n            sustained technical, financial, and administrative support\n            that cannot easily be provided through a single project.\n            Many actors are involved, and funding must be provided for\n            many different activities, such as sensitizing the\n            population on environmental linkages, formulating\n            subprojects, managing the subproject approval process,\n            contracting service providers, constructing facilities,\n            transferring funds, and properly maintaining facilities once\n            investments have been completed. This level of support is\n            particularly challenging in poor or isolated rural areas,\n            where public services and institutions are often limited or\n            nonexistent. CB EMP has shown that environmental investments\n            can deliver considerable benefits in the long term, but\n            funds are required not only for local investments but for\n            establishing and sustaining the public administrative\n            structures that provide technical and administrative\n            support. Encouraging vulnerable groups, such as women and\n            youth (as well as other underrepresented groups, like\n            herders in the case of Chad), to participate actively in CB\n            IEM subprojects can effectively empower these groups,\n            improve their livelihoods, and enhance their status in\n            society. The project actively promoted participation by\n            women and youth, which enabled both groups to improve their\n            living conditions and status. Training in CB EMP almost\n            always included women, and the involvement of vulnerable\n            groups was a condition for subproject approval."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Community-Based

Ecosystem Management Project is to restore some of the most\n            fragile ecosystems, by enabling local communities to better\n            fight desertification, rehabilitate degraded lands, and\n            protect biodiversity. It will be fully integrated into the\n            design, and implementation of the first phase of the Local\n            Development Program Support Project - PROADEL, whose\n            development objective is to reduce poverty, promote\n            sustainable rural development, and establish a\n            participatory, decentralized financing mechanism for\n            community-driven development initiatives. The first\n            component - financial support for community-based ecosystem\n            management subprojects - will co-finance subprojects to\n            support community-based ecosystem preservation, and natural\n            resources management activities within the Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) Priority Zones. Eligibility will\n            be restricted to activities requested by communities, within\n            their Local Development Plans, and the ecosystem management\n            schemes (under Component 2). Some of the activities likely\n            to be eligible include, inter alia, the reforestation and\n            rehabilitation of gallery forests, the development of\n            grazing corridors, community co-management of protected\n            areas, the introduction of agro-forestry techniques, the\n            development of local drought management plans, bushfire\n            awareness and control programs, and, pilots to demonstrate\n            or disseminate more sustainable, alternative energy\n            technologies and practices. The capacity building for\n            integrated ecosystem management component, will pursue\n            integrated ecosystem management priorities at larger scales,\n            and prepare sustainable, long-term ecosystem management\n            schemes in GEF priority zones, through the provision of\n            technical and organizational assistance. This will include\n            binding charters or conventions between riparian communities\n            that codify their intent to cooperate, and co-manage fragile\n            ecosystems in partnership with local government, traditional\n            local authorities, and decentralized agents of the Ministry\n            of Environment and Water (MEW), and, identifying subprojects\n            that could be implemented at the community level. In\n            addition, the component will support training activities to\n            benefit communities, and technical service agencies on\n            ecosystem management. The third component, - Support for an\n            enabling environment for community-based ecosystem\n            management - consists of analytical support to establish a\n            sound legal and regulatory framework for community\n            participation in environmental management, and joint\n            management of protected areas. Subcomponents include\n            institutional support, and sustainable financing to support\n            the promotion of partnerships between communities, and\n            external sources of financing outside of the GEF to sustain\n            ecosystem management schemes. Finally, the Management and\n            monitoring support component will support project\n            management, monitoring and evaluation activities, and the\n            monitoring of ecosystem management at the national level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Community-Based Ecosystem Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad - Community-Based Ecosystem\n            Management
