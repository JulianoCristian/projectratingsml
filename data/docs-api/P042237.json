Some lessons learned included:\n            within a broader national and international context of\n            buoyant economic growth, new and upgraded infrastructure can\n            help integrate poorer remote areas of a country and\n            contribute to reduce their poverty. This project's\n            improved road infrastructure gave the beneficiary provinces\n            better access, allowing them to keep pace with South-East\n            Asia's rapid economic growth, contributing poverty\n            reduction. Infrastructure that foments economic growth can\n            also trigger unexpected demands for the infrastructure\n            itself. This requires continuous monitoring to identify\n            problems and inform appropriate responses. In the case of\n            this project, the success of economic integration means that\n            the roads are carrying much heavier trucks than they were\n            designed for. More intense maintenance, strengthening the\n            pavement or restricting vehicle weights are among possible\n            responses. The chosen response has to be within local\n            financial and management capacity constraints. On-the-job\n            training prepares local officials and professional cadres to\n            carry on the work of development assistance after a project\n            has closed. It could be eligible for project funding. Formal\n            training programs and courses have roles to play, too, but\n            project design and implementation should ensure that the\n            learning from them is relevant to achieving an\n            operation's intended outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao, People's Democratic Republic of -\n            Provincial and Rural Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lao, People's Democratic\n            Republic of -

Some lessons learned included: the\n            multi-sectoral approach and the implementation delegated at\n            the provincial level proved to be efficient. The project\n            adopted a multi-sectoral implementation approach for road\n            transport, urban water supply, rural water supply and\n            capacity development, through sector based provincial units.\n            The organizational arrangements and coordination among\n            components were challenging at times, for they required\n            changes in the working methods to constant and open\n            communication among the various units.
