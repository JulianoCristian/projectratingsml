Bank's performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was highly satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) government's\n            commitment alone does not guarantee the allocation of\n            adequate funds for a project; (ii) the decision to address\n            maintenance requirements at a time when most projects\n            focused on new construction and rehabilitation yielded high\n            returns; (iii) parallel reforms, such as to develop and\n            maintain the capacity of the construction industry, must\n            move in consort with changes in how roads are maintained;\n            and (iv) the usual time
