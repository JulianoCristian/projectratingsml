The factor leading to the\n            cancellation of the loan was that prospects for obtaining\n            timely congressional approval of the loan appeared to be\n            remote and the Bank declined a Government proposal to extend\n            the deadline for effectiveness by an additional six months\n            beyond end-2006. Further discussions with the Government did\n            not succeed in remedying the problem, and in March 2007, the\n            Bank management decided to cancel the Loan Agreement.
