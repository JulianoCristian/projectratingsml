Support\n            Project for Vietnam aims to improve health services in the\n            Mekong region and to enhance access to and coverage of these\n            services, especially for the poor through: (i) strengthening\n            the health financing policy framework and increasing the\n            financial accessibility of health services for the poor and\n            near-poor; (ii) improving the availability and quality of\n            curative care, including responsiveness to changing disease\n            patterns; (iii) increasing the capacity of preventive health\n            activities; and (iv) building the capacity of the health\n            workforce. The recent Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review\n            of the project in July 2010 pointed out that the project\n            development objective (PDO) and intermediate result\n            indicators were not adequately formulated to measure the\n            achievement of the project with reasonable validity and\n            accuracy. The initial set of indicators was considered as\n            lacking focus on outcomes, not specific on quality dimension\n            to be measured, and vaguely formulated on patient\n            satisfaction. Following the QAG review, the project team\n            conducted a review mission to revisit the PDO and\n            indicators. It was agreed with the government counterparts\n            to revise the project results Indicators so as to better\n            measure project achievements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data

Support\n            Project for Vietnam aims to improve health services in the\n            Mekong region and to enhance access to and coverage of these\n            services, especially for the poor through: (i) strengthening\n            the health financing policy framework and increasing the\n            financial accessibility of health services for the poor and\n            near-poor; (ii) improving the availability and quality of\n            curative care, including responsiveness to changing disease\n            patterns; (iii) increasing the capacity of preventive health\n            activities; and (iv) building the capacity of the health\n            workforce. The recent Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review\n            of the project in July 2010 pointed out that the project\n            development objective (PDO) and intermediate result\n            indicators were not adequately formulated to measure the\n            achievement of the project with reasonable validity and\n            accuracy. The initial set of indicators was considered as\n            lacking focus on outcomes, not specific on quality dimension\n            to be measured, and vaguely formulated on patient\n            satisfaction. Following the QAG review, the project team\n            conducted a review mission to revisit the PDO and\n            indicators. It was agreed with the government counterparts\n            to revise the project results Indicators so as to better\n            measure project achievements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam -
