Despite the relatively\n            small project, lessons suggest that BOTAS could have\n            financed the study itself, but the Bank assistance was\n            requested in order to enhance the credibility of the study.\n            This strongly suggests that for the Bank, the operation\n            proved an expensive project per dollar loaned.
