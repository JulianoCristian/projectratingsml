Although the project\n            implementation was slow, it achieved its main objectives.\n            The effectiveness of extension services has improved through\n            fortnightly training of extension staff accompanied by\n            regular visits with contact groups by both extension and\n            research staff. Net farm incomes using improved practices\n            increased by almost US$400 per ha. Monitoring protocols and\n            indicators were established to periodically measure the\n            field impact of project activities. Through demonstration of\n            simple, low-cost technologies on mini-plots, more and more\n            farmers are becoming convinced of the validity of the\n            recommendations presented and showing increased interest in\n            the program.
