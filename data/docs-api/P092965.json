This allowed for the successful and timely\n            completion of the rural access component. The client ensured\n            that it consulted widely with private sector in order to\n            gauge both their interest and design a practical approach to\n            providing access in rural areas. The project proved that\n            there is significant untapped demand for mobile services in\n            rural areas. Beneficiary agencies and target services should\n            be identified prior to project inception. If e-Government\n            public private partnerships (PPPs) are to be prioritized,\n            either: (a) adapted standard bidding documents should be\n            produced, or (b) the bidding approach should be identified\n            during project design and work on the contractual aspects of\n            the bidding documents should begin at project inception.\n            Until the political environment in Mongolia matures, it will\n            be preferable to avoid scheduling system procurements which\n            span more than one election cycle. Despite change in\n            government and leadership at the implementation agencies,\n            the project implementation unit (PIU) was a constant that\n            helped keep the project on

of relevant ICT services among the rural population\n            through an incentive program designed to encourage the\n            participation of private operators in the rural segment of\n            the ICT market; and (b) increase private sector\n            participation in the delivery of e-Government services,\n            thereby improving public sector utilization of ICT. The\n            closing date for grants is proposed to be extended by one\n            year from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2013 in order to\n            allow for the implementation of the two e-Government\n            applications (Public Key Infrastructure and Certification\n            Authority, or PKI & CA and Portal System) to be\n            completed within the proposed extended closing date in line\n            with the actions agreed with the Government of Mongolia.\n            This extension will have no effect on the achievement of the\n            original project results other than the time delay. This\n            will be the first extension of the project. The extension\n            meets the criteria of OP 13.30, i.e., (a) the project\n            objectives continue to be achievable; (b) the performance of\n            the borrower and project implementing agencies is\n            satisfactory; and (c) the borrower has agreed a specific\n            action plan with the World Bank to complete the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia -
