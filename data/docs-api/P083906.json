is to: (i)\n            provide the recipient with emergency assistance in the\n            establishment of a more efficient customs and transit\n            regime; (ii) assist the recipient's efforts to\n            increase, in the short term, through the reduction of\n            customs irregularities and inefficiencies the collecting\n            capacity of the Afghanistan Customs Department (ACD) and\n            other collection agencies; (iii) assist the recipient's\n            efforts to decrease, in the medium to long term, trade\n            transaction costs through improvements in key customs and\n            related transit infrastructure and communications and\n            improvements in customs and transit administration; and (iv)\n            assist the recipient in laying the basis for a functioning\n            customs service and taking appropriate measures to\n            facilitate its international trade. The additional financing\n            will help finance a funding gap for selected core project\n            activities included in the original project scope. The\n            project has also helped in strengthening the institution\n            through policy changes, streamlining and harmonization of\n            various administrative and customs procedures including\n            development of more than 30 different procedures and\n            regulations, as well as 20 forms and reporting formats,\n            assistance in tariff classification, valuation and transit,\n            and technical advice on trade and transit agreements. The\n            project also helped in establishing the customs training\n            unit. More than 1000 staff has participated in 59 courses on\n            various subjects, organized by the training unit. In\n            addition, to help provide a professional environment for\n            ACD, more than 56 facilities have been rehabilitated,\n            constructed or functionally

Facilitation\n            Project for Afghanistan is to provide the Transitional\n            Government (TISA) with emergency assistance to start\n            establishing a more efficient customs and transit regime.\n            The project will achieve this through financing improvements\n            in: (a) key customs and related transit infrastructure and\n            communications; and (b) the capacity for customs and transit\n            administration. This will lay the basis for a functioning\n            customs service and facilitation of  Afghanistan's\n            international trade. The project will also finance some key\n            emergency assistance for implementing the accompanying\n            overall tax administration business plan.  The project will\n            help provide the financial basis for a functioning Afghan\n            state, by ensuring sustainable government revenue.\n            Facilitating the introduction of modem trade facilitation\n            will remove some of the impediments to enterprise and help\n            create the enabling environment for increased economic\n            activity and inward investment-- increasing the overall\n            revenue base for customs' collections, and yielding\n            annual savings of nearly US$29.6 million to the economy. The\n            project supports the TISA and its objective of developing a\n            unitary state with (a) substantial power and responsibility\n            vested in a central government, and (b) substantial\n            domestically generated resources available to fund the basic\n            functions of  the state. The project will be implemented\n            through a wide range of activities undertaken at locations\n            around the borders of Afghanistan. The project must be\n            considered as high risk in terms of both the present\n            security problems within Afghanistan and the potential\n            resistance to the basic aims and objectives of  the\n            projects. As the project affects a structural change within\n            Government and Afghanistan's external trade system,\n            there is the risk that the implementation of  the project\n            will be resisted by some or all of  the interest groups who\n            may be negatively affected. The potential risks are\n            recognized and mitigated, and implementation will involve\n            the private sector and other interest groups to influence a\n            gradual change from informality to formality and to minimize\n            the economic and social effects when the new regulations and\n            systems are implemented. The credit is expected to be fully\n            disbursed within a 42 month period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Emergency Customs\n            Modernization and Trade Facilitation
