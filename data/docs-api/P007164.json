Some lessons learned included: considering\n            project breadth, complexity, and simultaneity, inclusion of\n            change management technical assistance and monitoring will\n            have been highly recommendable. Full and partial\n            infrastructure privatization schemes, wholesale reform of\n            human resources and financial management, and institutional\n            restructuring each required political, strategic, and\n            organizational adroitness, much more so implementation of\n            the whole reform process. As could have been expected,\n            reform implementers met with opposition not only from\n            contending political forces, but also from sources internal\n            to the government and to the political party in power.\n            Components should be located within agencies that consider\n            them to be a strategic priority, otherwise progress will be\n            compromised. The Human Resources Management (HRM) component\n            was implemented by the Ministry of Finance during the\n            initial phase of implementation. However, the\n            component's objective that involved human resources\n            development did not fully match the Ministry of\n            Finance's take on it, which focused on payroll\n            management. Consequently, there was a major shift in\n            perspective for this component, which came to be understood\n            as control of expenditures, with resistance by other public\n            agencies and employee associations, undermining the\n            component's capacity to produce the expected results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Public Sector Modernization\n
