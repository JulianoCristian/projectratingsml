Some lessons learned included: local\n            participation and involvement, suitably incentivized, is\n            crucial to promoting distributed power generation\n            activities. Involving the private sector effectively in a\n            decentralized developmental effort requires flexibility in\n            implementation arrangements and space for adapting to market\n            conditions. An appropriate feed-in-tariffs policy and its\n            consistent and transparent application are crucial to spur\n            growth of small scale and non-conventional renewable energy\n            generation. Investments in off-grid electrification can be\n            underutilized or even abandoned in the event of a faster\n            than expected arrival of the electricity grid. To mitigate\n            this, the expansion of the grid should be coordinated with\n            off-grid investments, and, where warranted, the off-grid\n            facilities should be made

The changes are intended to\n            revise the end-of-project target for the 'off-grid\n            renewable' component from 161,000 households, small and\n            medium enterprises and public institutions being connected\n            to 113,500 as recommended by the ministry of power and\n            energy. The reduced target is appropriate in light of faster\n            than anticipated grid-based rural electrification which\n            reduces demand for off-grid renewable solutions. The\n            original target was 100,000 households and 1,000 small and\n            medium enterprises and public institutions to be connected\n            under the project through off-grid systems such as solar\n            photovoltaic investments as well community-based village\n            hydro and bio-mass schemes. The additional financing set an\n            additional target of 60,000 households (including 500 small\n            and medium enterprises) to be connected through off-grid systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Renewable Energy for\n            Rural Economic Development Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/10/12892827/sri-lanka-renewable-energy-rural-economic-development-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"LK-Renewable Energy For Rural Economic\n            Development -- P076702","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Energy Production and Transportation,Housing & Human Habitats,Power & Energy Conversion,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20101022003730"},"subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power,Renewable energy","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity, access to energy,\n            biomass, carbon, carbon emissions, communities, e-finance,\n            ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, electricity, Emissions reductions,\n            energy sources, Greenhouse, Greenhouse Gas, Greenhouse Gas\n            Emissions, grid, grid expansion, grid renewable energy, grid\n            solutions, grid systems, households, income, medium\n            enterprises, Power, power generation, power generation\n            capacity, private sector, RENEWABLE ENERGY, renewable energy\n            technologies, renewable power, result, RESULTS, rural\n            electrification, Supervision, targets"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF020484-BNPP-ENERGY : THE NETHERLANDS\n            ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY, ASIA ALTERNATI","repnb":"57450"},"facets":{}}}
