Delays associated with the performance of other\n            aid agencies in providing information and in implementation\n            of their components is a significant feature of this project\n            and indicates that the International Development Association\n            (IDA) could have been more fully involved in all aspects of\n            project preparation and implementation. The two main lesson\n            from this project is that longer lead times for procurement\n            and other vital actions should be allowed for than is\n            customary in the sector. The two main problems identified in\n            project formulation were: The inclusion of a main highway\n            link at the last moment, without sufficient preparation, and\n            analysis, and entrusting implementation to an ill-prepared\n            Department of Roads (DOR). The lack of direct IDA control\n            over the mechanics training component and technical\n            assistance for maintenance activities led to delays and less\n            than satisfactory performance. Although completion of most\n            components of the Project and disbursements of the credit\n            were delayed by about two years, the project's overall\n            objectives as
