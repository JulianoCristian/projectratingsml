Some\n            lessons learned include: strong political commitment and\n            ownership are critical for successfully steering a centrally\n            sponsored scheme. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) provided\n            development partners (DPs) with a viable platform to provide\n            consistent and concordant support to the program under a\n            common results framework, jointly designed with the\n            Government. A realistic assessment of the capacity is\n            important to inform the design and sequencing of the reform\n            programs for optimal impact. Regular diagnostic assessments\n            for tracking student achievement are good initial steps\n            towards improving student learning outcomes.

Despite\n            unprecedented economic growth, India faces a big challenge\n            in fighting poverty. Educational opportunities and access\n            were uneven at best and marked by wide regional disparities.\n            In 2000, around 39 million children under the age group of 6\n            to 14 were not being schooled. In 2002, the International\n            Development Association financed Elementary Education\n            Project named Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), to enroll all 6\n            to 14-year-olds in school by 2010. Since 2001, the SSA has\n            supported government efforts to bring 20 million\n            out-of-school children into elementary education. It\n            includes learners from long -deprived communities and\n            minority communities, and children with special needs.\n            Universal access was almost achieved, with more than 98\n            percent of children having a primary school within one\n            kilometer of home and many states almost approaching\n            universal primary enrollment. A paradigm shift in teaching\n            methods was pioneered in Tamil Nadu. In just two years, the\n            activity-based learning method was scaled up across the\n            schools. Several states were adapting the innovations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Making elementary education universal"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Making elementary\n            education universal"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2009/09/25480071/india-making-elementary-education-universal","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"primary schools, learners, employment,\n            educational facilities, dropout rates, economic growth,\n            school facilities, its, out-of- school children, elementary\n            education, schools, enrollment, learning outcomes, school\n            enrollment, special needs, groups, universal access, school\n            graduates, educational quality, alternative education,\n            primary school facilities, school children, teaching\n            materials, educational projects, development goals,\n            elementary school, teacher, children with special needs,\n            primary school graduates, knowledge, education programs,\n            children, education departments, quality education, teacher\n            recruitment, education, gender gap, statistics, training,\n            primary enrollment, enrollment of children, secondary\n            schools, teacher effectiveness, educational opportunities,\n            facilities, teaching methods, girls, public school, access\n            to primary education, direct grants, primary education,\n            school buildings, learning, graduates, research, goals,\n            primary school, classrooms, universal primary enrollment,\n            school, teaching, school levels, grants, out-of-school children"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"IN-India:  Elementary Education (Sarva\n            Shiksha Abhiyan II) -- P102547,IN-Elementary Education Project -- P055459","topic":"Education for All m1327049 1467,Economics of Education m1327511 1540,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,Education m1327048 470,Levels of Education m1326138 478","subtopic":"Gender and Education,Education For All,Primary Education,Effective Schools and Teachers,Tertiary Education","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Gender,Education","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0831ee4d0_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","theme":"Decentralization,Gender,Participation and civic engagement,Education for all","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Gender,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Education for All m1327049 1467,Economics of Education m1327511 1540,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,Education m1327048 470,Levels of Education m1326138 478","owner":"EDU GP SAR (GED06)","trustfund":"TF026950-NATIONAL FORESTRY DEVELOP.\n            & CONSERV.,TF026362-PHRD-STATE/DISTRICT ELEMENTARY\n            EDUCATION PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"94587"},"facets":{}}}
