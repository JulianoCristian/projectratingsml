The project achieved all its\n            objectives, within time end cost and its institutional\n            development success is noteworthy. The effective and\n            successful implementation of the environmental action plan\n            will have positive impacts on the physical and social\n            environment and the living conditions for residents in the\n            Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) area. In addition,\n            the project funded the Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC)\n            development planning and tariff study which provided the\n            necessary information for improving the management,\n            operation and financial performance of LEC. The main lessons\n            drawn from the implementation of the Lesotho Highlands Water\n            Engineering Project are: Careful monitoring, close\n            coordination in the implementation of various components,\n            and adherence to the implementation schedule at the early\n            stage are crucial for the timely completion of the project.\n            Attracting staff to the project implementing agency, care\n            should be taken not to cause a drain of skilled local staff\n            from other government agencies; early focus, open\n            information sharing, and debate are essential for ensuring\n            the agreement by all parties on a comprehensive\n            environmental action plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -
