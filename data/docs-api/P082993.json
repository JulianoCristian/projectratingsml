Some\n            lessons learned include: at the project design stage, in\n            situations where baseline data such as the number of sites\n            contaminated, the extent of site specific contamination, and\n            the level of clean-up required, is either difficult to\n            determine or simply not known, outcome indicators developed\n            should err towards the conservative, to avoid setting overly\n            ambitious targets that may require downgrading through\n            time-consuming restructuring in future. It is key to begin\n            work early on a clear plan for immediate next steps involved\n            in the application of a national PCB replication program,\n            endorsed by relevant government and private sector partners,\n            and ensure the ongoing use of high-value project inputs,\n            such as the thermal desorption unit (TDU). Effective PCB\n            management in accordance with Stockholm convention\n            guidelines involves treatment and disposal using technology\n            that meets best available techniques and best environmental\n            practices. When investing in such technology, thorough and\n            comprehensive prior assessment must be undertaken on the\n            proposed alternatives. Retrofitting one national service\n            provider to a level that meets international standards while\n            national standards remain less stringent does not\n            incentivize use of the upgraded facility. In projects where\n            legal dispensation is required to carry out work (licensing\n            or permitting), it is vital that the relevant legal\n            requirements be clearly understood and the centers of\n            authorization engaged from the outset of a project. Bank\n            supervision teams must ensure that local project partners\n            possess the knowledge and capacity required to manage\n            complex procurement actions effectively. Projects that\n            require extensive technical management must include specific\n            training to build such capacity so that smooth and efficient\n            processing ensues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - PCB Management and Disposal\n            Demonstration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - PCB Management and\n            Disposal Demonstration
