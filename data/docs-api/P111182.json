Ratings for the Second Phase of\n            the 135 Programs Supports Credit Project was as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the One-Two Public\n            Investment Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: excessive flexibility regarding the policy\n            content of a programmatic series weakens the program.\n            Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy\n            lending, there is room for striking a better balance between\n            flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially met triggers\n            as prior actions should be considered with particular\n            caution. Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and\n            other external partners to withdraw their support for weakly\n            implemented reform programs and unproductive policy dialogue\n            can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations.\n            The delays in the second operations of P135 and PIR, and\n            PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns with program\n            quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in\n            the case of P135. Arguments for budget predictability under\n            the Paris Declaration are less relevant in Vietnam due to\n            relatively small share of budget support in public\n            expenditures. A strong knowledge base is of critical\n            importance for upstream design of reforms and parallel\n            technical assistance to support their implementation.\n            Selectivity

Vietnam were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the breadth of\n            the reform undertaking and linkages among policy actions\n            across sectors called for a comprehensive approach to\n            dialogue and support by development partners. The strong\n            track record of government commitment and adoption by\n            partners of the PRSC series to match government priorities\n            and processes made this approach work. Analytical work gives\n            insight on inter-linkages across individual policy areas, as\n            well as cross-cutting issues, and helps ensure they are\n            appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported\n            under the operation. Dedicated and adequate resources for\n            analytical work and short-term technical assistance enables\n            the government and development partners to assess the\n            potential impacts of related policy actions and help refine\n            the proposals. Donor coordination can strengthen the policy\n            dialogue and deliver benefits to the client. The PRSC series\n            served as an effective framework for policy dialogue and\n            interactions between the government and donors. Government\n            line ministries voiced concern that financial flows from the\n            PRSCs went directly into the state budget, and their\n            participation in the often time-intensive policy dialogue\n            did not result in direct budgetary increases. Multi-sectoral\n            Development Policy Lending\u0092s (DPLs) may be best suited to\n            ministries that have clear and strong policy linkages, and\n            where improved policy coordination is a primary objective.\n            There is a need to complement consideration of outcome\n            indicators by looking at qualitative assessments of\n            achievements and also at complementary objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - A Series of Five Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - A Series of

         Credit (PRSC) Program is the fourth in a five-year cycle\n            aimed at supporting the implementation of the Socio-Economic\n            Development Plan (SEDP). PRSC are well-suited to address the\n            challenges Vietnam currently faces. This operation aims to\n            maintain the momentum for the reforms needed to transform\n            Vietnam from a transition to a middle-income country.\n            Emerging from massive poverty at the launching of Doi Moi in\n            1986, Vietnam is now on the verge of becoming a\n            middle-income country. There was a noticeable acceleration,\n            starting around 2001, in the government's drive towards\n            relying on market mechanisms, building a multi-stakeholder\n            economy and further integrating with the region and the\n            world. Over these years, comprehensive economic reforms have\n            led to rapid economic growth and remarkable progress on\n            poverty reduction and other development outcomes. The share\n            of the population living below the poverty line fell by\n            nearly half; from 28.9 percent in 2002 to only 14.5 percent\n            by 2008. Many of the remaining poor are from disadvantaged\n            groups (e.g. ethnic minorities) or live in more isolated\n            regions. Attaining middle-income status is seen as more than\n            a threshold level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per\n            capita, but as a way to emphasize the need for a set of\n            modern institutions. It entails further financial deepening\n            to support capital mobilization, the regulation of access to\n            and pricing of infrastructure services, the gradual\n            development of modern social insurance, more effective tools\n            for environmental protection, legal and judiciary reforms,\n            and the effective governance, among others. The SEDP\n            2006-2010 approved in June 2006 articulates this vision. As\n            this PRSC cycle draws close to the end, the Government of\n            Vietnam and development partners have approached the World\n            Bank to discuss possible successor operations to PRSC. The\n            form of such operations is still under discussion, but one\n            possibility is an overarching instrument, which is focused\n            on macroeconomic and a few cross-cutting issues, accompanied\n            with more in-depth sectoral development policy operations,\n            which would drill down to second generation reforms. A\n            preparatory study is currently underway for this purpose.\n            The World Bank is committed to providing assistance in a\n            broad spectrum of areas, including social sectors, even as\n            the country joins the ranks of middle-income countries.\n            Studies of other countries' experiences and in-depth\n            analysis of debt management and sustainability are currently\n            conducted jointly with the government so as to find the best\n            partnership strategy for the country for the coming years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Ninth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Ninth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit
