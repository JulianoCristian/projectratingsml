The Ethiopian Roads Authority\n            (ERA) was ultimately responsible for the supervision of the\n            road project. In general, all projects in the Adaptable\n            Program Lending II (APL2) were characterized by cost\n            overruns, costly design changes, schedule delays and issues\n            with quality of work and engagement with consultants and\n            contractors. The experience demonstrates that there is still\n            scope for ERA to improve in areas of project and design\n            management, construction risk management, value engineering\n            and asset management. Lessons learned from the\n            implementation of the APL2 include: (A) The ERA should\n            set-up a Technical Panel to focus on risk management and\n            value engineering of projects during preparation. (B)\n            Strategically driven and holistic capacity building, and\n            competitive remuneration is needed to attract and retain the\n            best staff. (C) Focus on improving cost effectiveness by\n            better analysis of the reasons for high costs, understanding\n            the reasons for cost variation and working collaboratively\n            with contractors to reduce costs across the entire project\n            portfolio. Overall, the project was instrumental in\n            successfully demonstrating the impacts achieved by combining\n            road provision with non-transport projects to improve access\n            and mobility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Second Road Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Second Road Sector\n            Development
