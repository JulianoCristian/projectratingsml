Some lessons learned included:\n            the CMHPP story should not go forgotten. There have been\n            very significant and unprecedented achievements in terms of:\n            (i) in situ biodiversity conservation; (ii) sustainable ex\n            situ Medicinal and Herbal (M/H) plants' experiences;\n            and (iii) dual effect on poverty alleviation and livelihoods\n            improvements, and concrete private sector business\n            opportunities. When a project has an important\n            'institutional building' value and objective a\n            community of partners for its continuity, in the case of\n            CMHPP it is outmost important that its design is also\n            consistent and that approaches and mechanisms are embedded\n            that can operationally ensure the result. In addition, such\n            investments would largely benefit by involving international\n            stakeholders who form part of a broader constituency and can\n            act as champions and independent brokers. For CMHPP, an exit\n            strategy from the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the\n            handing over of direct implementation and coordination\n            responsibilities to the National Center for Agricultural\n            Research and Extension, Royal Society for the Conservation\n            of Nature (NCARE, RSCN) and others should have been planned\n            at least during the last year of project operations. An\n            investment that is geared at creating a long term thrust out\n            of an unprecedented pilot should minimize in its design all\n            complexities and avoid over-abundance of objectives while\n            privileging only the fewer key components and activities\n            that can guarantee realistic and concrete impact. The\n            'income generating' component of the project\n            should have been more practically positioned in a follow up\n            investment. Conversely, a knowledge management activity will\n            have been more in tune and would have allowed higher\n            cohesiveness and integration among project stakeholders. A\n            well designed and implemented monitoring and evaluation\n            system is key for any project. This is even more important\n            in the case of a project with a 'global'\n            conservation/protection and natural resources sustainable\n            use thrust. Design and investment allocation need to be\n            consistent. In the case of CMHPP this is a lost opportunity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Conservation of Medicinal and\n            Herbal Plants Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan -

models to\n            improve the conservation of medicinal and herbal plants and\n            the livelihood of rural communities. This would be done\n            through the management and sustainable use of medicinal and\n            herbal plants (M/H) plants for human and livestock needs in\n            the Mujib Nature Reserve and the Central Upper Slopes of the\n            Rift Valley in Jordan, while ensuring effective in-situ\n            protection of threatened habitats and ecosystems in these\n            areas. There are four main components. Component 1,\n            institutional strengthening, is composed of 6\n            sub-components: establishing a project management unit;\n            developing links between government agencies, the growers of\n            medicinal/herbal plants, the pharmaceutical industry, other\n            producers of M/H plant products, nongovernmental\n            organizations, and consumers; designing an intellectual\n            property rights framework; establishing health and safety\n            standards; establishing a national M/H plants database and\n            gene pool; and designing and implementing a training\n            program. Component 2, the pilot-sites conservation\n            component, has two sub-components, namely the in-situ\n            protection and management of M/H plants and the ex-situ\n            production of rare, endangered and popular M/H plants to\n            relieve in-situ pressure. Component 3 consists of\n            environmental education and public awareness. Component 4\n            focuses on income generating activities, among them, organic\n            farming certification, standards for M/H plants for\n            harvested products, processing standards for M/H plant\n            manufactured products, quality control of M/H plant\n            products, product development, market identification, and\n            facilitating access to

Medicinal and Herbal Plants\n            Project, to conserve, and manage best practices for\n            medicinal, and herbal (M/H) plants, there might be an\n            eventual increase in grazing, and browsing plants due to the\n            project's potential success in reversing rangeland\n            degradation, obviously with a possibility of overgrazing\n            such areas by increasing animal numbers, and, as the\n            promotion of organic farming is one of the aims of the\n            project, integrated pest management will be part of the\n            project activities, with farmers using certain herbicides,\n            pesticides, and chemical fertilizers when growing M/H\n            plants. Mitigation stipulates the following: capacity\n            building, and training will be provided to manage\n            environmental protection, increase biodiversity, and improve\n            land-use management, and water management; protection of\n            wild M/H plants, limited grazing, as well as protection of\n            erosion prone areas, and improved rangelands through\n            increased uses of perennials; biodiversity will be\n            monitored, through agreed plans with beneficiaries to\n            promote, protect, and improve stocking of wild M/H plants;\n            reserves will be monitored to establish the effect of better\n            farming systems on soil, and water quality; management plans\n            will be developed to improve rangeland management, and\n            demonstrate best pastoral practices; community participation\n            will be encouraged to identify wild M/H plant areas, while\n            demonstration methods for growing, harvesting, and\n            processing M/H plants, and products will be enhanced; the\n            establishment of an organic certification will control the\n            use of pesticide, and herbicides, thus providing increased\n            market opportunities for \"organic\" M/H plants, and\n            products; and, the effects on biodiversity, water quality,\n            and carbon sequestration will be measured, and monitored."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Conservation of Medicinal and\n            Herbal Plants Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Conservation of\n            Medicinal and Herbal Plants Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/02/2079738/jordan-conservation-medicinal-herbal-plants-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"JO-Conservation Of Medicinal And Herbal\n            Plants Project -- P069847","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Drylands & Desertification,Water Conservation,Wetlands,Crops and Crop Management Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources,Environment,Agriculture","count":"Jordan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02121104124638"},"theme":"Other environment and natural resources management,Gender,Biodiversity","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Environment,Agriculture","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animals,biodiversity,capacity\n            building,chemical fertilizers,climate,climatic\n            zones,Conservation,cultivation,degradation,diseases,drought,ecosystems,endangered\n            species,environmental protection,equipment,erosion,erosion\n            control,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,feed,fertilizers,flora,Forestry,gardens,grazing,habitat,habitats,harvesting,herbicides,high\n            water,Income,income generation,integrated pest\n            management,land\n            use,livestock,mitigation,mulch,NGOs,nitrogen,organic\n            farming,organic matter,perennials,pest\n            management,pesticide,pesticides,plant production,Plant\n            Products,Plant Protection,Plant\n            species,planting,precipitation,preservation,private\n            sector,Programs,property rights,public awareness,quality\n            control,quality control\n            measures,rainfall,rangeland,rangeland\n            management,Sea,shrubs,soil,soil fertility,Soil\n            moisture,trees,Universities,vegetation,water\n            conservation,water management,water monitoring,water\n            quality,watershed,watershed management"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animals,biodiversity,capacity\n            building,chemical fertilizers,climate,climatic\n            zones,Conservation,cultivation,degradation,diseases,drought,ecosystems,endangered\n            species,environmental protection,equipment,erosion,erosion\n            control,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,feed,fertilizers,flora,Forestry,gardens,grazing,habitat,habitats,harvesting,herbicides,high\n            water,Income,income generation,integrated pest\n            management,land\n            use,livestock,mitigation,mulch,NGOs,nitrogen,organic\n            farming,organic matter,perennials,pest\n            management,pesticide,pesticides,plant production,Plant\n            Products,Plant Protection,Plant\n            species,planting,precipitation,preservation,private\n            sector,Programs,property rights,public awareness,quality\n            control,quality control\n            measures,rainfall,rangeland,rangeland\n            management,Sea,shrubs,soil,soil fertility,Soil\n            moisture,trees,Universities,vegetation,water\n            conservation,water management,water monitoring,water\n            quality,watershed,watershed management"}},"owner":"Envir & Nat.
