Some lessons learned included:\n            program design needs to be realistic, taking into account\n            the political economy, the context of fragility, technical\n            and other relevant challenges and risks. Specifically the\n            technical challenges of implementing specific reforms ought\n            to be taken into account in operation design. The reform\n            aimed at introducing a payroll system in two ministries on\n            pilot basis was not implemented as intended. This was\n            evidently not due to inadequate ownership on the\n            government's side, but rather because of the technical\n            challenge of implementing the reform within a given\n            timeframe turned insurmountable. Future operations should\n            assess not only the readiness to implement particular\n            reforms, but also the technical feasibility, when proposed\n            reforms have to undergo an implementation process that may\n            be technically challenging. Single tranche operations can\n            and should be designed with a medium-term agenda in mind\n            whenever possible. While it will probably not be appropriate\n            to design a programmatic DPG, given the high level of\n            uncertainty in West Bank and Gaza, this operation was\n            designed with some medium term objectives in mind and has\n            been successfully used as a platform to support the dialogue\n            with the authorities on the medium term program, even when\n            the implementation of some of its actions had to be\n            postponed. Finally, the medium term outlook has been a\n            useful tool in the preparation of a follow up operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Fourth Support\n            Palestinian National Development Plan Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza -

After a successful episode of implementing the\n            Palestinian Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP 2008-2010),\n            the caretaker government put forward the new National\n            Development Plan (NDP 2011-2013). Under the earlier PRDP\n            2008-2010, the caretaker government set out towards\n            restoring the basic operating systems of the PA while\n            reforming and creating stronger public institutions that\n            will form the basis of a future Palestinian state. The\n            current NDP 2011-2013 aims to move the PA fiscal and\n            institutional performance beyond recovery and towards\n            sustainability, by gradually reducing dependence on foreign\n            assistance while continuing to improve the welfare of\n            citizens. In February 2011 the PA cabinet resigned with the\n            expectation of formation of a new cabinet within five weeks.\n            This did not happen and the existing cabinet has continued\n            in an acting capacity. On May 4, 2011, the PA in the West\n            Bank signed a reconciliation agreement with the leadership\n            in Gaza, calling for the formation of an interim unity\n            government and announcing a plan to hold national elections\n            by 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Fourth Support\n            Palestinian National Development Plan
