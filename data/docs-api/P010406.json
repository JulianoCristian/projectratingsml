The project\n            achieved its main physical objectives, institutional\n            development has been partially achieved, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, for important infrastructure projects like\n            SMHP, the arrangements for procurement and a management plan\n            of ICB contracts should be agreed upon and finalized before\n            credit effectiveness. Second, organizational arrangements\n            for the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure\n            installed under the project must be finalized and in place\n            prior to the commencement of commissioning and take over.\n            Third, limiting turnover of key project personnel is\n            critical when dealing with ICB contracts to avoid disputes,\n            penalties, and delinquencies in contractual obligations.\n            Fourth, the success of operation and sustainability of\n            infrastructure projects depends on the physical soundness of\n            structures, as well as the project's social and\n            organizational responsiveness to the concerns of all\n            stakeholders. Finally, O&M arrangements should be in\n            place and tested for at least one year before the closure of\n            the credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Sunsari Morang Headworks Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal -
