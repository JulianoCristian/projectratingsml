Some lessons learned includes: a well\n            formulated sector policy and strategy are essential if gains\n            are to be sustained. The likely passage of the roads law and\n            approval of the rural roads policy are important, but do not\n            fulfill the need for a well formulated policy and strategy\n            to guide the development of the sector, and thereafter\n            ensure its sustainability. The role and importance of a road\n            network's 'missing middle' needs to be\n            documented and understood. There is a general understanding,\n            supported by extensive literature on rural roads, which all-\n            weather good quality roads at the subnational level\n            contribute to the improved health and welfare of those\n            served. Contextual constraints need to be identified and\n            accommodated. The project sought to strengthen the capacity\n            of small to medium-sized contractors and thereby begin the\n            process of moving from force account to the contracting out\n            of maintenance works. For Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) frameworks to be useful, they have to employ\n            indicators that are relevant and useful to decision-makers.\n            Lasting improvements in governance cannot be served by\n            establishment of parallel systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -
