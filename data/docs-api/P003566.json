Despite\n            China\u2019s impressive progress in raising health standards in\n            the 1960s and 1970s, a health divide emerged in the 1980s\n            between poor rural areas and rich urban regions. Infant\n            mortality rates were three times higher in rural areas and\n            maternal mortality rates were twice as high. The problems in\n            rural healthcare resulted from a decline in government\n            support for public health programs, a top-down approach to\n            health planning, and a lack of coordination between various\n            health system levels. In the late 1990s, China, with support\n            from the World Bank and other development partners,\n            undertook to improve basic health services and increase\n            healthcare accessibility for an estimated 47 million people\n            living in poor rural areas through the Eighth Basic Health\n            Project. The Project was set out to help China strengthen\n            its rural health sector by upgrading rural health\n            facilities, improving the quality and effectiveness of\n            health service programs, and increasing the affordability of\n            essential health care for the poor. With improved prenatal\n            care and increased hospital delivery, maternal and infant\n            mortality rates were nearly halved in project areas and\n            health service utilization increased considerably among the\n            rural poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Investing in health care for China\u2019s rural poor"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Investing in health care for\n            China\u2019s rural poor"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/25171012/investing-health-care-china\u2019s-rural-poor","count":"China","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"project, health information, equity, health\n            centers, health planning, health service utilization, infant\n            mortality, basic health services, health reforms, health\n            sector, poverty, risk sharing, rural areas, national health\n            policy, public health services, cooperation, all,\n            information system, health systems, national health, health\n            facilities, health sector reform, hepatitis b, health\n            programs, health system, patients, tuberculosis, maternal\n            health, community, prenatal care, cost control, community\n            health, health project, expenditures, immunization, infant\n            mortality rates, health information system, debt, social\n            development, care, vaccination, income, maternal and child\n            health, treatment, capital investments, gender, basic\n            health, essential health care, health promotion, training,\n            health policy, health interventions, health services,\n            tuberculosis control, financing, health financing, equality,\n            workers, health care, public health, medical expenses,\n            costs, cataract, health resources, hospitalization, health\n            service, medical equipment, implementation, bronchitis, fee\n            for service, health, public health programs, medicine, child\n            health, services, urban areas, families, hepatitis, health\n            expenditures, tb, interventions, medical staff, service,\n            mortality, primary care, risk, facilities, strategy, gender issues"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Rural development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Invertir en atenci\u00f3n de salud para los\n            pobres de zonas rurales en China"}},"topic":"Health Management and Administration\n            m1326358 1383,Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Health Technologies m1327278 1331,Public Health m1327519 635,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625,Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621","projn":"CN-Basic Health (Hlth8) -- P003566","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Disease Control & Prevention","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08315901b_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia and Pacific!$!119225"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia and Pacific!$!119225"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia and Pacific!$!119225"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Health,Central government administration,Compulsory health finance,Non-compulsory health finance,Sub-national government administration","theme":"Rural services and infrastructure,Child health,Health system performance","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Management and Administration\n            m1326358 1383,Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Health Technologies m1327278 1331,Public Health m1327519 635,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625,Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population - GP (GHNDR)","trustfund":"TF027029-PHRD-BASIC HEALTH SERVICES\n            PROJ.

Some\n            lessons learned included: Strong ownership and commitment at\n            the highest levels of government, together with a group of\n            empowered, reform-minded professionals charged with the task\n            of implementing major reform projects and who understand the\n            major risks and strategies to overcome them is critical to\n            ultimate success of a reform project. An ability to change\n            project details in response to a dynamic and positive\n            national policy environment is also important. Designed\n            appropriately, projects provide a very good platform for\n            sound policy dialogue and reform strategy design and\n            implementation. Project training can contribute to overall\n            capacity building, support implementation of changed\n            technical protocols and processes for service delivery, and\n            help institutionalize management systems when systematically\n            conducted. Community participation and stakeholder\n            consultations assist with both ownership and clarity of\n            objectives and implementation strategies. The internal\n            policy of Government of China (GOC) which requires\n            under-resourced counties to repay Bank credits creates\n            serious problems for counties (and provinces) and ultimately\n            impacts on the fees charged or the viability of hospitals\n            and service providers to the extent they become liable for\n            the repayment. It also creates, inappropriately, a\n            reluctance to spend on quality enhancing training, technical\n            assistance, and other intangible items of expenditure. On\n            the other hand it probably increases ownership of local\n            governments to expenditures undertaken because they have to\n            repay the loans. Ultimately it is important to get the\n            incentives right and this probably argues for rapidly\n            increasing current national government revenues allocated to\n            local government programs including health."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Basic Health Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Basic Health Services
