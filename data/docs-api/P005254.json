The project is aimed at producing 1.2 million\n            tons per year of potash drawn from the Dead Sea via solar\n            evaporation. The project might also produce potash\n            derivatives such as compacted potash and potassium sulphate\n            if the marketing study to be completed by March, 1979\n            confirms their financial viability. The major components of\n            the project include: (i) a solar evaporation and brine\n            transfer system to concentrate the Dead Sea brine and\n            transfer it between carnallite pans; (ii) a harvesting\n            system for dredging and transporting the solids precipitated\n            in the pans; (iii) a refinery to produce fertilizer grade\n            potash; (iv) utility facilities consisting of power,\n            telecommunications, and water supply and sewerage system;\n            and (v) an associated township."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Arab Potash Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Arab Potash Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/08/726903/jordan-arab-potash-project","projn":"JO-Potash Production -- P005254","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Chemical & Petrochemical Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Montreal Protocol","teratopic":"Environment","count":"Jordan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912382328"},"subsc":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,ammonia,bank\n            deposits,Bonds,bromine,Centrally planned\n            economies,ceramic,chemical\n            engineers,chemicals,chemists,Chloride,Co,consumers,debt,developed\n            countries,Ecology,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic\n            Development,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Electricity,employment,evaporation,excess\n            supply,exclusive\n            rights,exports,extraction,fertilizers,GDP,growth\n            rate,income,limestone,magnesium,MARKET\n            ECONOMIES,minerals,mines,Mining Company,mining\n            products,natural\n            resources,nitrate,nitrogen,nutrients,OPEC,ores,Petroleum,phosphate,phosphoric\n            acid,phosphorus,Potash,POTASH INDUSTRY,Potassium,potassium\n            carbonate,potassium salts,PP,producers,resource\n            base,salt,small- scale,soap,Sulphate,sulphur,sulphuric\n            acid,value added"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,ammonia,bank\n            deposits,Bonds,bromine,Centrally planned\n            economies,ceramic,chemical\n            engineers,chemicals,chemists,Chloride,Co,consumers,debt,developed\n            countries,Ecology,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic\n            Development,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Electricity,employment,evaporation,excess\n            supply,exclusive\n            rights,exports,extraction,fertilizers,GDP,growth\n            rate,income,limestone,magnesium,MARKET\n            ECONOMIES,minerals,mines,Mining Company,mining\n            products,natural\n            resources,nitrate,nitrogen,nutrients,OPEC,ores,Petroleum,phosphate,phosphoric\n            acid,phosphorus,Potash,POTASH INDUSTRY,Potassium,potassium\n            carbonate,potassium salts,PP,producers,resource\n            base,salt,small- scale,soap,Sulphate,sulphur,sulphuric\n            acid,value added"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"1922"},"facets":{}}}
