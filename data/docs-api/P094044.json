The important\n            project lessons learned were: (1) Political economy plays a\n            critical and direct role in highly visible projects. (2) A\n            corridor and framework approach should be applied in\n            preparation and implementation of the same type of road\n            projects. In this way, a corridor approach will be followed\n            in subsequent projects - and thus, the same framework will\n            be applied throughout the entire road corridor. (3) The\n            Project should allocate sufficient time and budget for the\n            pre-construction activities, including preparation and\n            review of designs. (4) Both the client and the Bank need to\n            be very diligent in ensuring that reporting requirements\n            from both the contractor and the supervision consultant are\n            enforced in order to ensure that contract management be\n            exercised without putting the client in a weak position with\n            the contractor. (5) If establishment or operation of a road\n            safety inter-agency coordinating body is included in the\n            project's results framework, the project should also\n            include support to this body.
