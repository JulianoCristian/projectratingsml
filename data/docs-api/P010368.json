The project only\n            partially achieved its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was deficient.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            implementing poverty alleviation activities through NGOs\n            operating under an apex semi-government organization is an\n            extremely complex and demanding task. Second, the economic\n            rationale and technical feasibility of project components\n            needs to be analyzed and developed with care. Third, pilot\n            projects, as a basis for testing strategies and approaches,\n            can play a central role in facilitating overall project\n            success. Fourth, a high quality and effective MIS, including\n            regular beneficiary surveys, is essential to ensure\n            efficient project implementation and achievement of\n            objectives. Fifth, it is important to exploit synergy\n            effects. Sixth, it is important to provide training to NGOs\n            and POs in poverty alleviation activities. Finally, the\n            Government's broad strategy for poverty alleviation in\n            Sri Lanka underwent a major shift in emphasis mid-way\n            through the project's lifespan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Poverty Alleviation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Poverty Alleviation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/731687/sri-lanka-poverty-alleviation-project","projn":"LK-Poverty Alleviation -- P010368","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980804142602"},"subsc":"(Historic)Social assistance","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"analytical work,annual\n            rate,beneficiaries,Beneficiary Assessment,beneficiary\n            participation,capacity building,CAS,Child\n            Nutrition,climate,community development,complex\n            task,corruption,Currency Unit,economic growth,economic\n            problems,effective strategy,Employment,escape\n            poverty,evaluation activities,exchange rate,farm\n            activities,flexibility,food insecurity,governance\n            structure,human capital,ICR,impact indicators,IMPLEMENTATION\n            COMPLETION REPORT,implementing agency,improved access,income\n            households,inflation,Institutional Development,Labor\n            Force,Labor Force Survey,labor market,long term,low\n            income,malnutrition,Migration,monitoring\n            mechanisms,monitoring system,mothers,national\n            policies,NGO,nursing,Nutrition,nutrition\n            programs,participatory approach,participatory\n            approaches,participatory poverty,partnership,Performance\n            Indicators,PMU,policy research,political factors,poor\n            households,Poverty Alleviation,poverty alleviation\n            programs,Poverty Indicators,poverty line,Poverty\n            Monitoring,Poverty Policy,poverty reduction,poverty\n            strategy,productivity,program\n            implementation,programs,Project Objectives,public funds,real\n            wages,research findings,resource\n            allocation,Savings,schools,social capital,Social\n            Mobilization,social welfare,Structural\n            Adjustment,Targeting,technical assistance,technical\n            skills,transparency,unemployment,violence,wage income,wage rates,waste,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"analytical work,annual\n            rate,beneficiaries,Beneficiary Assessment,beneficiary\n            participation,capacity building,CAS,Child\n            Nutrition,climate,community development,complex\n            task,corruption,Currency Unit,economic growth,economic\n            problems,effective strategy,Employment,escape\n            poverty,evaluation activities,exchange rate,farm\n            activities,flexibility,food insecurity,governance\n            structure,human capital,ICR,impact indicators,IMPLEMENTATION\n            COMPLETION REPORT,implementing agency,improved access,income\n            households,inflation,Institutional Development,Labor\n            Force,Labor Force Survey,labor market,long term,low\n            income,malnutrition,Migration,monitoring\n            mechanisms,monitoring system,mothers,national\n            policies,NGO,nursing,Nutrition,nutrition\n            programs,participatory approach,participatory\n            approaches,participatory poverty,partnership,Performance\n            Indicators,PMU,policy research,political factors,poor\n            households,Poverty Alleviation,poverty alleviation\n            programs,Poverty Indicators,poverty line,Poverty\n            Monitoring,Poverty Policy,poverty reduction,poverty\n            strategy,productivity,program\n            implementation,programs,Project Objectives,public funds,real\n            wages,research findings,resource\n            allocation,Savings,schools,social capital,Social\n            Mobilization,social welfare,Structural\n            Adjustment,Targeting,technical assistance,technical\n            skills,transparency,unemployment,violence,wage income,wage rates,waste,workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
