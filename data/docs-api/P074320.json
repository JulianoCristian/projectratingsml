Some lessons\n            learned included: a thorough analysis of the capacity of\n            contractors to undertake the civil works prior to the\n            commencement of implementation should be done as part of the\n            procurement process. This will prevent the situation where\n            contracts are terminated before the contract is completed.\n            Every effort should be made to use appropriate criteria for\n            engaging local contractors to increase their participation\n            in project implementation, especially in the implementation\n            of civils works. Considering the situation in the country\n            after the civil war, the concept of using the SPs for\n            implementing the project was an appropriate and relevant\n            approach. As the service providers (SPs) were in a position\n            to access the war-affected areas, they were in a unique\n            position to execute the project activities. However, the\n            capacity of these SPs also needed to be continually assessed\n            even during implementation as there was significant staff\n            turnover. Trainers should undertake regular follow-up on\n            trainees after training and give feedback to the Ministry of\n            Education, Youth and Sports (MEYS). They should also\n            participate in the mentoring of the untrained and\n            unqualified teachers. A strategy to maintain project staff\n            after project closing especially in the Sierra Leone\n            environment where the capacity needed to be strengthened and\n            sustained is necessary during project preparatory stages.\n            Especially given that capacity strengthening can usually be\n            expected to go beyond the short term project implementation\n            period. Ambitious targets are always hard to measure and\n            more so indicators in a post-conflict and capacity\n            constrained environment. The Project delivered many key\n            inputs into the education system. Unfortunately the focus of\n            the indicators seemed to be on outcomes which are difficult\n            to meet during the relatively short implementation period.\n            It is important that projects implemented in a challenging\n            environment such as this also rely on input and output indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Rehabilitation of Basic\n

Specifically,\n            the project will: a) assist participating schools to achieve\n            basic operational level (BOL); and b) build up the capacity\n            of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST)\n            to plan and manage education services. The project was\n            prepared by IDA, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and UK\n            Department for International Development (DFID). The\n            components are: 1) support to education service providers to\n            bring primary schools and Junior Secondary Schools (JSS) to\n            BOL standards by a) introduce peace education into the\n            curriculum, b) support non-formal and emergency education\n            programs, c) HIV / AIDS education prevention, d) support the\n            expansion of the Grants Program; and 2) enhance the\n            institutional capacity of the MEST by a) establishing a\n            Project Coordination Union (PCU); b) strengthening the\n            MEST's planning and management capacity; and c) support\n            the training of 80 teacher trainers who will provide\n            in-service training for unqualified teachers. The\n            Bank's role in supporting a participatory approach in\n            disarmament, reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in\n            Sierra Leone positions this project to

The\n            environmental analysis concluded that there are no\n            significant environmental issues related to this project,\n            since project sites will not affect national parks, natural\n            reserves, nor cultural heritage sites, for these were\n            completely destroyed during the civil war. While the\n            findings of the EA show that the project was well conceived,\n            taking implicit consideration of environmental concerns.\n            Mitigation measures are as follows. Construction of\n            buildings will be in accordance with existing building\n            codes, i.e., adequate toilet facilities will be provided\n            with proper waste disposal systems. During construction,\n            open pits will be installed; waste disposal sites will be\n            selected; while landscaping, and vegetative propagation will\n            be undertaken following construction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Rehabilitation of Basic\n            Education Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone - Rehabilitation of\n            Basic Education Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/02/1792437/sierra-leone-rehabilitation-basic-education-project-environmental-assessment","count":"Sierra Leone","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"animals,annual rainfall,biological\n            diversity,construction,construction activities,construction\n            stage,drainage,drainage system,drinking water,environmental\n            degradation,Environmental impact Assessment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental management,Environmental\n            Protection,erosion\n            control,evaporation,farming,fishing,furniture,garbage,gardens,gravel,hygiene\n            education,infiltration,iron,land cover,land use,litter,local\n            authorities,local communities,mangrove,mangrove\n            swamps,mangroves,manure,mining,Physical\n            Characteristics,pipes,pit latrine,pit\n            latrines,pollution,programs,provision of services,provision\n            of water,provision of water supply,Public\n            Health,recycling,rivers,rubbish,runoff,sand,sanitary\n            conditions,Sanitation,Sanitation Facilities,scrap,scrap\n            metals,screening,sea,seasonal rainfall\n            pattern,sediments,sewage,sewage disposal,soil\n            erosion,soils,solar radiation,solid waste,solid waste\n            collection,solid wastes,stratification,surface\n            runoff,swamps,toilet facilities,town,tree\n            planting,trees,urban areas,waste,waste disposal,waste\n            disposal system,waste water,wastes,water contamination,water\n            management,water resources,Water storage,Water Supply,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"animals,annual rainfall,biological\n            diversity,construction,construction activities,construction\n            stage,drainage,drainage system,drinking water,environmental\n            degradation,Environmental impact Assessment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental management,Environmental\n            Protection,erosion\n            control,evaporation,farming,fishing,furniture,garbage,gardens,gravel,hygiene\n            education,infiltration,iron,land cover,land use,litter,local\n            authorities,local communities,mangrove,mangrove\n            swamps,mangroves,manure,mining,Physical\n            Characteristics,pipes,pit latrine,pit\n            latrines,pollution,programs,provision of services,provision\n            of water,provision of water supply,Public\n            Health,recycling,rivers,rubbish,runoff,sand,sanitary\n            conditions,Sanitation,Sanitation Facilities,scrap,scrap\n            metals,screening,sea,seasonal rainfall\n            pattern,sediments,sewage,sewage disposal,soil\n            erosion,soils,solar radiation,solid waste,solid waste\n            collection,solid wastes,stratification,surface\n            runoff,swamps,toilet facilities,town,tree\n            planting,trees,urban areas,waste,waste disposal,waste\n            disposal system,waste water,wastes,water contamination,water\n            management,water resources,Water storage,Water Supply,wells"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"SL-Rehabilitation Of Basic Education -- P074320","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water Conservation,Water and Industry,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation","authors":{"authr":"Johnson,Reynold Godfrey"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02052904093672"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Secondary education,Primary education","theme":"Education for all,Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"EDU GP AFR WEST & CENTRAL (GED07)","trustfund":"TF026796-PHRD-SIERRA LEONE:\n            REHABILITATION OF BASIC EDUCATION (BANK-EXECUTED),TF026885-PHRD-SIERRA LEONE:\n            REHABILITATION OF BASIC EDUCATION PROJ.
