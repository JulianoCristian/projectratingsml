The overall performance\n            of both the World Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned included the\n            following: Targeting: More attention should be devoted to\n            improve targeting even when poverty is pervasive. An\n            important is the application of transparent and objective\n            selection and allocation criteria. Several approaches can be\n            envisaged: When no poverty map is available, a standard\n            allocation formula for districts and communes can be\n            introduced as this would increase predictability for local\n            governments and communities. Finally, communes could be\n            classified into three to five categories of poverty to\n            allocate a little more to poorer ones. When poverty data is\n            available, targeting can be done on the basis of\n            \"objective\" needs. In Madagascar, information is\n            now available through recently completed data sources such\n            as the poverty map or the commune census on local\n            infrastructure endowments and economic potentials.\n            Monitoring and Evaluation: While the Social Development Fund\n            (FID) collected abundant information on project\n            implementation, the lack of counterfactual and baseline data\n            presents a number of challenges for analyzing the impact.\n            Good data collection should therefore be paired with good\n            methodology and a clearer evaluation strategy. Surveys on\n            the operation and maintenance of the completed sub-projects\n            should be preformed regularly and remedial actions should be\n            taken in a timely manner.  Sustainability:. Creating\n            maintenance committees is not sufficient to ensure\n            sustainability of community sub-projects. More permanent\n            efforts have to be devoted to ensure that these associations\n            continue to function after sub-project completion. In\n            addition, social funds should develop more binding\n            agreements and cooperative arrangements with line agencies\n            in order to ensure that commitments for the operation of\n            infrastructure are respected. Ultimately however, only\n            sector policy dialogue can solve this issue. The Supervision\n            budget of multi-sectoral projects should reflect the\n            multi-sectoral nature of these projects. Failing to do so\n            may limit the impact of some category of sub-projects.\n            Coordination with other sectoral Bank operations: The\n            framework for coordination of the FID with rural projects\n            was agreed upon and put in place but there was no follow-up.\n            There should be a permanent coordination mechanism to\n            maximize synergies between projects. This can take the form\n            of monthly meetings of Bank and project staff for social\n            sector and rural projects. However, in the long-run more\n            government involvement and a more coherent national strategy\n            for local development would be required to improve\n            coordination on a more permanent basis. Donor Coordination:\n            Efforts should be made during preparation to make social\n            funds programmatic - with the social fund becoming the\n            principal government vehicle for channeling various donor\n            resources into local development. Although some competition\n            may be good, utter fragmentation is not. Local-level\n            stakeholders complain that various community development\n            programs-including different Bank-funded programs-have\n            different requirements (e.g. for beneficiary contributions,\n            sub-project cycle etc..). Fragmented community-driven\n            development donor programs also have the tendency to drive\n            local development agendas rather than support them. Again,\n            more government involvement, and clearer policy guidance\n            would help resolve these problems on a more permanent basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Third Social
