The main lessons from these credits are: 1)\n            Small, focused, one-tranche policy projects with realistic\n            objectives, supported by technical assistance, may work well\n            in transition countries that are politically unstable and\n            have low market economy skills. A limited reform agenda is\n            easier to implement, especially if parliamentary approval is\n            needed for new laws when the political landscape is not\n            stable. Reform continuity can be maintained by similar\n            policy or investment follow-on projects. 2) The very quick\n            preparation and disbursement o f PESC was effective in\n            providing development assistance and coordinating\n            substantial humanitarian assistance. 3) Disbursement against\n            a negative list of imports expedited resource transfer,\n            which was appropriate in Albania's circumstances. 4)\n            Aid coordination--including the appropriate alignment o f\n            government agencies--is critical to ensure appropriate,\n            harmonized and effective assistance where many donors are\n            involved. 5) Some organizations established for special\n            purposes under IDA projects could be transformed into\n            private sector commercial entities when their mandate is\n            complete. This transition could be an integral part o f that\n            organization's strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit, Recovery\n            Program Technical Assistance

import credit with disbursements against a positive lists of\n            imports, which was more typically used in similar situations\n            in other countries. This quick disbursing budgetary support\n            credit was a very effective instrument during a crisis\n            situation as it allowed the rapid transfer resources. 2)\n            This project was an effective element in coordination\n            between development and humanitarian assistance. Although\n            the budgetary support did not directly finance humanitarian\n            assistance, it provided support for public services directed\n            to the Albanian population itself. 3) The quick timing and\n            high visibility of the credit was essential in strengthening\n            partnership in Albania and building credibility for IDA. 4)\n            To expand and further strengthen the limited policy program\n            supported by the Credit, additional support from subsequent\n            operations was essential.
