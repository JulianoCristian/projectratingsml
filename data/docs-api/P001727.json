The key lessons showed that: 1) project outcome\n            must not only be measured in terms of immediate health\n            indicators, but rather on the structural contribution\n            towards the long-term health sector reform benefits; hence,\n            the successful transition from a project, to an inclusive\n            program approach. Within a reform context, the success of a\n            project lies on its support to reform, reinforcing the\n            government's own involvement in all sectors. Therefore,\n            established legal and regulatory frameworks, are essential\n            in decentralizing health care services; 2) a national health\n            policy aimed at decentralization of communal health care\n            services, must ensure these communities to be trained and\n            able to manage their health centers. Human resources and\n            institutional capacity need to be evaluated early, with\n            measurable indicators; 3) local community participation\n            should be ensured; to this end, the creation of a transitory\n            entity succeeded, and set the basis for an initial support\n            in community health management; 4) decentralization requires\n            strong NGOs to support its process, and strengthen communal\n            solidarity and capacity; and, 5) effective donor\n            coordination lies on government ownership and leadership."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -

The population component will: (a) strengthen the\n            institutions in charge of disseminating/implementing the\n            national population policy and of planning, managing and\n            evaluating family planning (FP) programs; and (b) increase\n            the demand for, availablity and quality of FP services\n            nationwide. The rural water supply component will: (a)\n            increase the supply of safe drinking water for the rural\n            population in the project area; (b) support the\n            government's policy of community participation in the\n            financial and technical management of rural water supply;\n            and (c) implement an iodination program in areas where\n            iodine deficiency is prevalent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Second Health, Population and Rural\n            Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Second Health, Population\n            and Rural Water Supply Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/02/735736/mali-second-health-population-rural-water-supply-project","projn":"ML-Health/Population/Ru -- P001727","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Health Economics & Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Mali","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960929085943"},"subsc":"Health,Other social services,Water supply,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to safe water,affordable\n            health,Alcohol,Bilateral Aid,birth rate,Child\n            Health,Construction,death rate,distribution\n            system,employment,essential drugs,Family\n            Planning,goiter,health indicators,health needs,health\n            services,income,investment program,living conditions,local\n            communities,migration,morbidity,mortality,mortality\n            rates,natural resource base,partnership,population\n            growth,Primary Health Care,private sector,Public\n            Health,public sector,rural communities,Rural Water,Rural\n            Water Supply,safe drinking water,sectoral reforms,service\n            delivery,Sud,water points"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to safe water,affordable\n            health,Alcohol,Bilateral Aid,birth rate,Child\n            Health,Construction,death rate,distribution\n            system,employment,essential drugs,Family\n            Planning,goiter,health indicators,health needs,health\n            services,income,investment program,living conditions,local\n            communities,migration,morbidity,mortality,mortality\n            rates,natural resource base,partnership,population\n            growth,Primary Health Care,private sector,Public\n            Health,public sector,rural communities,Rural Water,Rural\n            Water Supply,safe drinking water,sectoral reforms,service\n            delivery,Sud,water points"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF022050-HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJ. - MALI","repnb":"P5439","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Deuxieme projet sante, population et\n            hydraulique rurale - Mali"}}},"736276":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/02/736276/mali-second-health-population-rural-water-supply-project","available_in":"French,English","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"French","entityid":"000356161_20100820034235","node_id":"736276"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/02/736276/mali-second-health-population-rural-water-supply-project","new_url":"1991/02/736276/mali-second-health-population-rural-water-supply-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/02/22/000009265_3960929085800/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/02/22/000009265_3960929085800/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"2217","docdt":"1991-02-22T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2001-04-27T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Mali - Second Health, Population and Rural\n            Water Supply Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project objectives are to improve\n            the health status and well-being of the Malian population,\n            notably women and children, implement its emerging\n            population policy, and broaden access of deprived rural\n            communities to health services and safe water.
