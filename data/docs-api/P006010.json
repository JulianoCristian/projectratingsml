Some\n            lessons learned includes: a pre-defined and well-prepared\n            portfolio of investments ready for implementation remains\n            prudent, and can mitigate the tendency for innovative\n            difficult projects to absorb much time in the early years in\n            'learning by doing' but not disbursing. Leveraging\n            maximum impact from resources allocated for subprojects\n            requires the identification of investment proposals in a\n            transparent, strategic and participatory manner, promoting\n            competition for support through targeting mechanisms which\n            ensure high quality, sustainable subproject proposals\n            consistent with project development objectives and sector\n            priorities. Capacity-building at the provincial level must\n            be tailored to the unique technical, institutional and\n            financial endowments of each province, avoid standardized\n            training and technical assistance of uneven relevance and\n            utility, and adopt both demand and supply-driven approaches.\n            Complex, difficult operations in the rural sector with long\n            lead times and a high degree of innovation require an\n            extended horizon, continuous support for progressive\n            capacity building and repeat financing to maximize impact,\n            learning and sustainability. Private sector actors in the\n            agro industrial sector and producers should not be assumed\n            capable of responding on their own to public Investments in\n            rural infrastructure and services. Project investments are\n            necessary to stimulate private investment but not sufficient\n            to guarantee further investment especially if financial\n            resources and lines of credit are unavailable or\n            inaccessible. Evaluation results from irrigation subprojects\n            in Mendoza province suggest that further, comprehensive\n            interventions are needed to increase provincial\n            competitiveness in open global markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Provincial Agricultural\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Provincial\n
