Some lessons learned included: 1) Regularly\n            reviewing the organizational effectiveness of implementing\n            agencies and quickly addressing weaknesses can help ensure\n            that agencies perform as effectively as possible; 2)\n            Introducing joint billing for water and wastewater can\n            increase public acceptance and minimize costs for\n            administration of the scheme; 3) Raising awareness of\n            industries of their responsibility for environmental\n            management and working with them to find a solution can be\n            more effective than a confrontational approach; 4) Laws\n            allowing losing bidders to put an injunction on\n            implementation can result in significant project delays; 5)\n            Public outreach and incentives are essential to encourage\n            people to pay for services that provides a public rather\n            than private good; 6) Encouraging development partners to\n            delegate the supervision of their project funds can help\n            reduce the transaction costs to government of dealing with\n            multiple partners; 7) Including from the beginning a\n            well-designed house connection program in the project to\n            accompany construction of treatment plants will help assure\n            that it achieves its environmental objectives and financial\n            sustainability; and 8) Thoroughly preparing a project\n            monitoring and evaluation system prior to the start of a\n            project will ensure that stakeholders can track progress\n            towards the project objectives as soon as implementation starts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius -

pollution. During project design, a buffer zone\n            will be created around the WWT plant site perimeter to help\n            reduce noise and offensive odors. If trees are planted in\n            the buffer zone, potential odors carried inland by sporadic\n            onshore breezes will also be further diminished. Noisy\n            equipment will be enclosed. During construction, contractors\n            will deploy silt curtains to minimize disturbance of\n            sediments on the sea floor; locate and place anchors to\n            avoid damage to the reef and massive corals; prevent and\n            control discharges from vessels; contain waste fuel oil and\n            retain garbage until properly disposed of onshore; provide\n            emergency spill containment facilities; light construction\n            vessels to ensure against collision with vessels in coastal\n            waters; plan work hours to minimize nuisances and\n            disturbance to the community; and plan trench digging to\n            coincide with slack tide--or conditions which minimize\n            deterioration in water quality. During operation, the plant\n            manager will ensure that effluent quality is monitored daily\n            and problems remedied as soon as possible; ensure that\n            sludge is dewatered and regularly removed to the landfill;\n            ensure rapid diagnosis and repair of industrial and\n            wastewater leaks, spills, and blockages, and alert\n
