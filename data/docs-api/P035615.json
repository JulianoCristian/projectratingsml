Lessons underline the\n            unique, and significant nature of this project,\n            demonstrating that, by and large, a community-based\n            nutrition project can produce impressive results. It has\n            shown that an emergency situation effectively dealt with,\n            can become the starting point of a larger-scale national\n            operation, whose key success was the involvement of an\n            experienced private sector management institution, of a\n            strong political commitment, and of an empowered community\n            participation. However, on project design, and preparation,\n            it would have been better had the roles, and\n            responsibilities of the coordinating been clearly defined,\n            to avoid unnecessary delays, or lack of human, and financial\n            resources. The ambitious performance criteria led to too\n            much focus on treating symptoms, than on prevention, whereas\n            a flexible approach could have adapted appropriately to\n            implementation needs. These implementation needs showed that\n            more information on cost-effectiveness, and the longer-term\n            impact of the approach was needed to evaluate results,\n            including the evaluation of contracting to different\n            providers. From the institutional point of view, it is\n            important to allow for competition among executing agencies\n            to promote capacity building, and stimulate\n            cost-effectiveness, by testing different approaches for\n            adequate delivery services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -

of the most\n            vulnerable groups (malnourished children under 3 years of\n            age and pregnant and nursing mothers) in targeted poor urban\n            neighborhoods; 2) provide potable water to unserviced\n            neighborhoods of the nutrition program; and 3) enhance\n            household food security in poor rural and urban areas during\n            critical periods of vulnerability. Its implementation\n            objectives are to demonstrate the feasibility of targeted,\n            efficient and cost-effective delivery of community nutrition\n            interventions and execute a poverty-oriented program through\n            a privately operated agency. The project consists of three\n            major components. The first encompasses a nutrition program\n            consisting of information, education and communication (IEC)\n            interlocutors supported by supplementary feeding for the\n            target population in urban areas and a small fund for\n            research and development. The second component funds a water\n            program in the targeted neighborhoods of the nutrition\n            program. The third component is a pilot rural household food\n            security program. As an integral part of these components,\n            there will be a package of managerial health and technical\n            assistance and training to build local capacity for\n            nutrition/health services delivery, and a management\n            information system for monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Community Nutrition
