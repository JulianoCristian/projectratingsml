Some lessons learned included: a realistic\n            assessment of the resources available, skills and commitment\n            of the Implementing Agency's (IAs) could have led to\n            better project implementation structure. The problems\n            experienced by the project underscores the need for an\n            Operations Manual (OM) that can serve as a guide in the\n            implementation of a complex project. The OM should clearly\n            specify the roles and responsibilities of the implementing\n            agencies. It can also ensure consistency in the application\n            of procedures, consolidation of required outputs, and\n            continuity in the event of management and personnel changes\n            during project implementation. The manual can also instruct\n            how to develop maintenance and budget plans and other\n            maintenance activities. Ideally spelled out in the OM, these\n            requirements should be clearly identified prior to project\n            start up. A seeming shortcoming in the entire project cycle\n            is the lack of formal participation of key stakeholders in\n            design and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -

to\n            assist the Government of the Philippines in enhancing the\n            economic productivity and quality of life of Metro Manila\n            residents by improving the operational efficiency and safety\n            of the transport system and access to public transport and\n            nonmotorized transport. The project has five components. The\n            first funds public transport improvement measures comprising\n            integration between modes, improvement of interchange\n            facilities, and measures for introducing public transport\n            priority; traffic management; measures for controlling\n            inappropriate frontage activity and measures for improving\n            road safety for pedestrians by providing sidewlaks and other\n            facilities; measures for bicycles and pedicabs; and safe\n            bicycle parking at stations. Landscaping and greening will\n            be included in all project components. The second component\n            improves access to the MARIPAS-Marikina Valley area\n            (Marikina, Rizal, and Pasig), specificallyrelieving the\n            Marcos Highway/Aurora Boulevard corridor and establishing an\n            at-grade traffic management scheme--which will act as an\n            efficient conduit for traffic to and from Metro Manila, and\n            extending a critical road section. The third component\n            comprises improvements to secondary roads such as pavement\n            rehabilitation and drainage and sidewalk improvements. The\n            fourth component supports non-motorized transport and the\n            fifth component builds capacity in traffic management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Metro Manila Urban\n

Marcos Avenue extension, as\n            well as issues related to the Marikina Bridge, and its\n            access road component. The ROW is a Government's\n            responsibility in regards to its alignment, and\n            compensation; local governments were included in discussions\n            on possible cost-sharing, and on the valuation of the ROW\n            costs. As of those discussions, the project area was cleared\n            for project implementation, though socioeconomic impacts did\n            occur as a result of demolitions, removal of trees, and,\n            adversity to farmland, and private residential land in the\n            Industrial Valley. However, land acquisition is no longer an\n            issue: properties along the ROW of the access road, and\n            Marikina Bridge are government owned, donated in January\n            1995, while private land should not be affected by the\n            project, based on an agreed new scheme. Affected\n            populations, mainly squatter families, were relocated to\n            different sites (government, or privately owned), of easy\n            access to job opportunities. Construction materials for\n            temporary shelters, transportation, and food assistance were\n            provided, and, displaced persons were encouraged to organize\n            as a community, with the provision of government assistance,\n            and training. Currently, monitoring concerns employment\n            problems, security measures at resettlement sites, and a\n            continuing technical assistance in the provision of infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Policy framework for land acquisition,\n            resettlment and rehabilitation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Metro Manila Urban\n            Transport Integrated Project : resettlement plan (Vol. 3) :\n            Policy framework for land acquisition, resettlment and rehabilitation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/05/1121166/philippines-metro-manila-urban-transport-integrated-project-resettlement-plan-vol-3-policy-framework-land-acquisition-resettlment-rehabilitation","projn":"PH-Metro Manila Urban Transport Integration\n            Project -- P057731","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Climate Change and Environment,Urban Housing,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement","docty":"Resettlement Plan","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Social Development,Environment","count":"Philippines","authors":{"authr":"Philippines"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01051005004082"},"subsc":"General transportation sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Social Development,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural land,Arable land,building\n            materials,common good,common\n            property,Communities,Compensation,compensation at\n            replacement,construction,cost analysis,displacement,economic\n            effects,entitlements,expropriation,Fair\n            compensation,farmers,habitat,housing,indigenous\n            peoples,Institutional Framework,inventory,Involuntary\n            Resettlement,LAND ACQUISITION,land value,laws,Legal\n            Framework,loss of income,loss of land,market prices,market\n            value,private assets,Private property,Project Affected\n            Persons,property owners,public\n            agencies,RAP,repair,resettlement,Resettlement Action\n            Plans,resettlement activities,Resettlement\n            Policy,Resettlement programs,resettlements,rural\n            areas,security of tenure,social analysis,social\n            impacts,Social Services,soil,Squatters,transaction\n            costs,Transport,urban areas,Vulnerable Groups,zoning"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural land,Arable land,building\n            materials,common good,common\n            property,Communities,Compensation,compensation at\n            replacement,construction,cost analysis,displacement,economic\n            effects,entitlements,expropriation,Fair\n            compensation,farmers,habitat,housing,indigenous\n            peoples,Institutional Framework,inventory,Involuntary\n            Resettlement,LAND ACQUISITION,land value,laws,Legal\n            Framework,loss of income,loss of land,market prices,market\n            value,private assets,Private property,Project Affected\n            Persons,property owners,public\n            agencies,RAP,repair,resettlement,Resettlement Action\n            Plans,resettlement activities,Resettlement\n            Policy,Resettlement programs,resettlements,rural\n            areas,security of tenure,social analysis,social\n            impacts,Social Services,soil,Squatters,transaction\n            costs,Transport,urban areas,Vulnerable Groups,zoning"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029614-PHRD-MANILA URBAN TRANSPORT MGMT.PROJ.","repnb":"RP47"},"facets":{}}}
