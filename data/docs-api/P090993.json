Some\n            lessons learned included: financing public health functions\n            instead of vertical programs (HIV/AIDS, immunization, etc.)\n            allows for the improvement of the delivery of vertical\n            programs while strengthening health systems overall. In\n            federal settings where provinces have a large degree of\n            autonomy, the signing of 5-year umbrella agreements between\n            federal and state levels outlining each party's\n            responsibilities protects against political risk. The\n            inclusion of an emergency contingency component in\n            investment operations is an effective approach to address\n            emergencies. Realistic risk assessment regarding\n            implementation capacity will ensure the needed support is\n            built into project design. Project evaluation methodologies\n            need to be defined during preparation to ensure the needed\n            information is available. The Governance and Accountability\n            Action Plan (GAAP) provides a common fiduciary tool to\n            address overall systemic accountability issues. Its joint\n            design with the Government will increase ownership and\n            effectiveness. In addition, agreed supervision plan and\n            regular close supervision by the Bank's fiduciary team\n            has substantially reduced implementation risk since its

objectives of the Essential Public\n            Health Functions and Programs Project (FESP) for Argentina\n            are to increase the coverage of ten prioritized Public\n            Health Programs; reduce population's exposure to\n            principal risk factors associated with collective illness;\n            and improve the stewardship role and appropriate regulatory\n            environment of the Nation's public health system. The\n            purposes of the restructuring are: (i) to modify three\n            project development indicators, (ii) to reallocate loan\n            proceeds; and (iii) to extend the project closing date by 12\n            months from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. The\n            Project FESP is financed by a US$220 million loan that was\n            approved by the Board of Executive Directors of the World\n            Bank on November 21, 2006 and has been effective since\n            September 6, 2007. To date the Project has disbursed\n            US$184.66 million, with a remaining undisbursed balance of\n            US$35.21 million. The targets of three out of six Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) indicators were fully achieved\n            in 2010. These include the following: (i) measles\n            eradication; (ii) congenital rubella eradication; and (iii)\n            reduction of tobacco prevalence among the population of 18\n            to 64 years old. Progress with these indicators reflects the\n            Borrower's intensive work on epidemiological\n            surveillance of vaccines and tobacco control, both of which\n            have been supported by the Project through a Public Health\n            Activities (PHA) output based mechanism. The Project has\n            made significant progress in Public Health Activities\n            implementation. In 2010, implementation of PHAs increased by\n            almost 100 percent as compared with the cumulative amount\n            PHAs executed in the last three years of the Project.\n            Progress made demonstrates that management by results is now\n            accepted by the provinces as an effective instrument for the\n            implementation of public policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Essential Public Health\n            Functions and Programs Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Essential Public\n

principal risk factors\n            associated with collective illness; and improve the\n            stewardship role and appropriate regulatory environment of\n            the nation's public health system. The project\n            components are: 1: The activities financed by this component\n            seek to improve capacity at the national and provincial\n            level to carry out the essential public health functions\n            that are at the core of health stewardship and necessary for\n            the success of key public health programs. This component is\n            divided into two subcomponents, one geared to strengthen\n            functions at the national level and the other at the\n            provincial level. 2: Activities financed by this component\n            seek to i) improve efficiency and equity of the provision of\n            medical supplies necessary for the success of priority\n            public health programs; and ii) contribute to a rapid and\n            organized response from the health sector in the case of a\n            health emergency. This component is divided into two\n            subcomponents: to strengthen inputs management and\n            performance monitoring for priority public health programs,\n            and to improve preparedness and response to a potential\n            Avian Influenza epidemic, and other health emergencies and\n            natural disasters. 3: Activities to be financed under this\n            component will aim to provide supervision and monitoring of\n            Project implementation, to ensure its transparency, and to\n            create positive externalities in the area of
