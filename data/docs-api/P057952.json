Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) The improved poverty targeting strategy\n            developed under the ASIF II Progress contributed\n            significantly to the project's ability to benefit the\n            poorest communities and to poverty reduction in Armenia. The\n            lesson that can drawn here is the importance of having a\n            clearly formulated poverty targeting and an allocation\n            mechanism based on objective criteria and poverty data\n            ensuring the flow of project benefits to the neediest\n            segments of the population; 2) Experience under the ASIF\n            program, as in other SIF programs, has underlined the\n            importance of delivering good quality community works\n            projects identified as priority projects by poor\n            communities; 3) The approach of the ASIF II project to\n            integrate multi-sector community-based projects with local\n            institution building and self-management has been effective\n            in ensuring the sustainability of its operations. The\n            success of this approach derives from the convergence of\n            several mutually reinforcing factors: (i) deliberate\n            responsiveness to local needs and priorities; (ii) local\n            institutional capacity building complementing the\n            Government's decentralization policy; (iii) innovations\n            in poverty targeting, promotion and outreach; and (iv)\n            systematic and continuous monitoring and evaluation; and 4)\n            During project design and in the course of project\n            implementation, discussions with the ASIF and with the\n            Government focused on the strengths of the ASIF, the\n            opportunities ahead, the challenges the ASIF is likely to\n            face in the medium and longer term, and the vision of its\n            future role. These discussions were important as they\n            contributed to the process of gradually mapping the future\n            direction of the ASIF."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Second Social Investment Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Second Social\n            Investment Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/04/7591528/armenia-second-social-investment-fund-project","projn":"AM-Social Investment Fund 2 Project (Sif\n            2)-313573 -- P057952","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Population Policies,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Community Development and Empowerment,Urban Services to the Poor,Municipal Financial Management","teratopic":"Social Development,Poverty Reduction,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Armenia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070509105704"},"subsc":"General education sector,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,Poverty Reduction,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, assets, audits, basic social\n            services, beneficiaries, beneficiary assessments, capacity\n            building, CAS, communities, community demand, community\n            development, Community Infrastructure, Community\n            Infrastructure Projects, community involvement, community\n            management, Community meetings, community members, community\n            outreach, community ownership, Community participation,\n            community Value, decentralization, Development Goals,\n            Development Objectives, earthquake, economic growth,\n            economic transition, effective outreach, employment\n            opportunities, equalization, good governance, government\n            capacity, Government commitment, Gross Domestic Product,\n            housing, Human Development, ICR, immigration, Implementation\n            Completion Report, Implementing Agencies, income, income\n            distribution, incremental development, information\n            dissemination, Information System, job training, labor\n            markets, legislation, Lessons Learned, livelihood, living\n            conditions, living standards, local communities, local\n            contractors, local development, Local Government, local\n            governments, macroeconomic stabilization, management\n            training, Modernization, municipal, natural disasters,\n            natural resources, nature of women, needs assessment,\n            participatory processes, per capita income, Performance\n            Indicators, poverty alleviation, poverty assessments,\n            poverty indicators, poverty reduction, procurement,\n            procurement procedures, programs, progress, Project\n            Appraisal, Project Implementation, Project Management,\n            Project Management Unit, Project objectives, project\n            preparation, public services, quality control, refugees,\n            regional equity, regional population, rural areas,\n            sanitation, school attendance, school children, secondary\n            school, secondary schools, service delivery, sewage, social\n            capital, social development, social funds, Social Sector,\n            social services, statistical analysis, supply systems,\n            Targeting, taxation, Technical Assistance, unemployment,\n            urban areas, urban services, utilities, village councils,\n            vulnerable groups, wages, water supply"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024403-ARMENIAN SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND\n            - II,TF026162-PHRD-SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND II\n            PROJECT (BANK-EXECUTED),TF036467-ARMENIA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND (PROTECTION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE),TF037582-ARMENIA - SOC.

The school, fully\n            reconstructed in the summer of 2005, was granted the\n            permission to teach 12 grades instead of 10 and will produce\n            its first high school graduates in two years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"In Armenia, community gets warm school it\n            asked for"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"In Armenia, community gets warm\n            school it asked for"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/23974617/armenia-community-gets-warm-school-asked","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"career, classroom, high school, high school\n            graduates, math teacher, School enrollment, school year,\n            seasonal workers, Secondary School, society, workers"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Urban development,Rural development,Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","topic":"Education Access and Equity m1327050 2127,Education Policy and Planning m1326781 1513,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,School Administration m1326117 1510,School Health m1326124 503","projn":"AM-Social Investment Fund Project\n            (Sif)-118343 -- P035768,AM-Social Investment Fund 2 Project (Sif\n            2)-313573 -- P057952","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Disability,Teaching and Learning,Educational Institutions & Facilities,Education For All,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Social Protections and Labor,Education","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150209135401"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General education sector,Sub-national government administration,Micro- and SME finance,General industry and trade sector,Central government administration,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","theme":"Improving labor markets,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Participation and civic engagement,Rural services and infrastructure,Urban services and housing for the poor,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Social Protections and Labor,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Education Access and Equity m1327050 2127,Education Policy and Planning m1326781 1513,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,School Administration m1326117 1510,School Health m1326124 503","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["F","C"],"trustfund":"TF024403-ARMENIAN SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND\n            - II,TF026162-PHRD-SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND II\n            PROJECT (BANK-EXECUTED),TF036467-ARMENIA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND (PROTECTION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE),TF037582-ARMENIA - SOC.

This component also funds school furniture\n            purchases, provides capacity building and technical\n            assistance to local contractors and implementing agencies;\n            and finances consulting services for micro-project design\n            and supervision.
