The key lessons learned\n            include: Alignment of project and government political, and\n            continuity in reform objectives are critical for project\n            success. Confidence and communication among agencies and the\n            Bank are critical. The administrative principle of unit\n            operation works better than the functional principle.\n            Adequate and consistent policy on selection, training, and\n            motivation of unit's staff is important for unit\n            efficiency. The involvement of the regional structures of\n            Bulgarian Medical Association, Regional Health Insurance\n            Fund, and Regional Health Center and in decision-making\n            relating to the selection of practices under primary health\n            care subject to repair and equipment contributed to the fair\n            and smooth process of allocating the offers. The investments\n            made in the emergency medical system influenced\n            significantly the mortality rate in emergency cases. The\n            restructuring of blood transfusion system is part of the\n            overall restructuring of the health sector and in-patient\n            care in particular. People's motivation to donate blood\n            is in direct relationship to the economic state of the\n            country and to the development of civil society.

status of the population, while at the same time\n            improving the efficiency of the health care delivery system.\n            The project comprises four main components: (i) policy\n            analysis and management which will primarily assist the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) in building up a capacity for\n            policy analysis and evaluation and will finance a limited\n            number of key studies such as a burden of disease analysis\n            and cost-effectiveness studies; (ii) primary health care\n            which will improve the quality and scope of primary health\n            care in selected municipalities; (iii) emergency medical\n            services which will support ongoing efforts by MOH to\n            restructure emergency medical services and improve the\n            effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery; and (iv)\n            blood transfusion which will assist current efforts to\n            improve the supply and quality of blood and blood products\n            by restructuring and rehabilitating the network of blood\n            transfusion centers by introducing safer and more up to date\n            technology and by actively promoting the recruitment of new donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Health Sector Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Health Sector\n
