Some lessons learned included: scope of\n            Project Development Objectives (PDO) in fragile states. PDOs\n            should be simpler, less ambitious and more realistic for\n            countries with limited implementation capacity and a fragile\n            political environment. The time estimated for project\n            implementation should also be more realistic.
