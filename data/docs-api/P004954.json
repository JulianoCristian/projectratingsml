Positive lessons reinforce the\n            importance of realistic project design in accordance with\n            Government priorities, as well as that of government\n            commitments, particularly from government officials directly\n            involved in project activities, with a preparatory framework\n            set prior to implementation, to significantly achieve\n            success, as demonstrated in this operation. Nonetheless,\n            negative lessons from this project point at the need to\n            establish distinct output, and outcome indicators, as well\n            as project impact indicators with a base value, and target\n            value, to help assess the degree of achievement of the\n            project's development objectives, and sustainability,\n            particularly on those objectives of intangible nature, such\n            as those relating to quality, and efficiency of the\n            education system. To this end, it is worth undertaking an\n            impact evaluation of the project, which should provide an\n            objective analysis of achievements, and identify unexpected\n            challenges. This could have benefited the project, given its\n            restricted supervision. In addition, greater attention\n            should have been paid to contractual enforcement, and\n            include an action plan for handling cases of non-compliance\n            with the loan agreement. Finally, as a general lesson,\n            education projects should emphasize reform policies, in\n            order to achieve significant impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Basic and Secondary Education\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Basic and Secondary\n            Education Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/09/1614894/algeria-basic-secondary-education-support-project","projn":"DZ-Basic & Secondary Education Support\n            Project -- P004954","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01102404051060"},"subsc":"Secondary education,Central government administration,Primary education,Tertiary education","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,addition,assessment\n            methodology,assessment techniques,basic\n            education,climate,counselors,curricula,curriculum,decentralization,education\n            level,education levels,education policy,Education\n            Reform,education sector,education system,educational\n            environment,educational indicators,educational\n            materials,educational\n            quality,educators,employment,enrollment,geography,Human\n            Development,in-service training courses,increasing school\n            enrollment,Institutional\n            development,instruction,instructional\n            materials,leadership,learning,learning achievements,learning\n            outcomes,let,local level,mathematics,mid-term\n            review,National Education,parents,pedagogy,performance\n            indicators,philosophy,Primary Education,primary\n            schools,private sector,psychology,public\n            expenditure,retirement,safety,schools,science\n            teachers,Secondary Education,secondary schools,significant\n            impact,student interest,teaching,teaching methods,technical\n            training,textbook content,textbook\n            production,textbooks,training abroad,training\n            courses,training programs"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,addition,assessment\n            methodology,assessment techniques,basic\n            education,climate,counselors,curricula,curriculum,decentralization,education\n            level,education levels,education policy,Education\n            Reform,education sector,education system,educational\n            environment,educational indicators,educational\n            materials,educational\n            quality,educators,employment,enrollment,geography,Human\n            Development,in-service training courses,increasing school\n            enrollment,Institutional\n            development,instruction,instructional\n            materials,leadership,learning,learning achievements,learning\n            outcomes,let,local level,mathematics,mid-term\n            review,National Education,parents,pedagogy,performance\n            indicators,philosophy,Primary Education,primary\n            schools,private sector,psychology,public\n            expenditure,retirement,safety,schools,science\n            teachers,Secondary Education,secondary schools,significant\n            impact,student interest,teaching,teaching methods,technical\n            training,textbook content,textbook\n            production,textbooks,training abroad,training\n            courses,training programs"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF033023-MENA REGION - EDUCATION\n            (MOROCCO & ALGERIA),TF031409-TUNISIA ;
