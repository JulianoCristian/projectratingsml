It is\n            arguable whether the introduction of structural reforms in\n            the power sector was appropriate, given the payment crisis\n            Ukraine was undergoing, followed by the obvious reduction in\n            income levels, and the significant decline in demand, which\n            lead to an excess energy capacity. The lessons identify that\n            there is little merit in pursuing comprehensive power sector\n            reform policies, in a country with major economic crisis,\n            thus project objectives should have been only targeted at\n            improving technical, institutional, and financial problems.\n            The Bank should apply strict policies on the financing of\n            working capital, and essentially confine such financing to\n            the prevailing circumstances. While the project intended to\n            benefit the power generation companies, providing working\n            capital, thus dependent on revenue collection, but with no\n            encouragement to improve such collection through legal\n            means, nor incentives to perform, the Bank could have had\n            influence over this critical segment of the sector, had the\n            project addressed distribution as well. When reviewers\n            opinions are critical of an operation, such as in this case,\n            in respect to long-term borrowing for financing fuel, and\n            for the creation of a competitive market given the\n            circumstances, more weight should be given to those opinions\n            in the project approval process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Electricity Market
