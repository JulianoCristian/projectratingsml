Nonetheless, lessons\n            reinforce the need for Government commitments at all levels,\n            to succeed in the implementation of sectoral reforms. In\n            this case, key aspects of educational reforms, should have\n            been framed in the broader context of a civil service\n            reform, to achieve the desired reforms in organization, and\n            management of the Ministry of Education. Furthermore, the\n            lack of coordination between the Ministries of Finance, and\n            of Education, prevented construction of a new building for\n            the education ministry, determined as key to achieving the\n            ministry's management strengthening. Despite initial\n            consultations with stakeholders, disappointment was\n            expressed on project design, and objectives, leading to\n            unfulfilled expectations on its final outcome. The project\n            thus failed to incorporate stakeholders' inputs;\n            therefore, improved dialogue with stakeholders during\n            implementation, would also strengthen ownership, and\n            overcome difficulties (such as teacher union position on\n            adjustment of teacher/student ratios). Moreover, project\n            design would have better succeed, had the design of\n            infrastructure works - assigned to a renowned architectural\n            firm, but proven not sufficient - been prepared at an early\n            stage, allowing time to adjust considerable aspects during\n            implementation, and reduce cost overruns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominica - Basic Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominica -

The\n            project is intended to: 1) strengthen the planning and\n            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth\n            Affairs and Sports (MOE) to guide and carry out the\n            long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to\n            initiate significant, urgent measures to address system-wide\n            qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary\n            level; and 2) serve as a catalyst for a major adjustment\n            process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of\n            primary and secondary teacher to student ratios, in line\n            with ratios of countries of comparable economic and social\n            development. The project comprises three major components:\n            1) a strengthening management and planning component; 2) a\n            qualitative improvement of basic education component, which\n            will enhance the quality of teaching and learning; and 3) an\n            expansion and conservation of school places component, which\n            will assist MOE to provide more secondary school places in\n            the most under-served districts to reduce long distance\n            travel and facilitate access to educational opportunities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominica - Basic Education
