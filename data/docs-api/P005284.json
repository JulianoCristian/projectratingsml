Several lessons are drawn from the project.\n            Although broad consensus supports the viability of a Road\n            Maintenance Fund (RMF) to stabilize funding sources for road\n            maintenance, it is suggested that the introduction of RMFs\n            can be politically sensitive, and that such measures are\n            more likely to succeed when undertaken in the context of an\n            improving economy. It is also arguable that road maintenance\n            should not be financed through Bank loans, but as indicated\n            above, in times of economic difficulties, lending for\n            periodic road maintenance, would prevent deterioration of\n            road assets, avoid significant increases in trade, and\n            business transaction costs, in the form of higher vehicle\n            operating/transport costs on bad roads, and maintain an\n            essential element for economic growth. Realistic, and\n            attainable objectives should form the basis of a\n            project's design, and, this design should be such, that\n            significant disbursement may occur during the first year of\n            implementation, i.e., for infrastructure projects, this\n            requires that major technical designs, and procurement\n            documents be completed by Board presentation, with actual\n            bidding commencing prior to effectiveness; thus deadline\n            pressures should be resisted, to avoid significant risks in\n            quality at entry,
