Some lessons\n            learned included: one key learning from the project was that\n            demand-side interventions (such as Janani Suraksha Yojana -\n            JSY) are important and possibly necessary, but not\n            sufficient conditions for quality enhancement. Going\n            forward, additional efforts are needed to strengthen the\n            quality of the RCH services, in addition to those already\n            underway (such as accreditation, third party review, quality\n            improvements at clinic level, team based training and\n            reviews, strengthened skill trainings such as SBA (Skilled\n            Birth Attendance) and IMNCI (Integrated Management of\n            Neonatal and Childhood Illness), etc). Despite the fact that\n            health is a state subject in decentralized India, the\n            financing model followed by RCH II and NRHM (National Rural\n            Health Mission), whereby federal budget allocations were\n            tied to specific reforms and strengthening state and\n            district-level capacities, greatly enabled wide-spread\n            policy reforms. Further, the provision of some flexible\n            funds went a long way in enabling innovations at state and\n            district levels. The project enabled countless innovations\n            in service delivery models, especially at state and\n            district-levels. This is one of the key success factors for\n            the project, and it will not have been possible without the\n            flexible funds at decentralized levels. Future projects may\n            benefit from a similar approach. Since most of the program\n            targets were achieved well before the end of the project and\n            many were surpassed, the question remains whether the\n            targets could have been set higher and whether these could\n            have been adjusted upwards at the time of restructuring?\n            However, at the time of restructuring, data from Third\n            District Level Household Survey (DLHS 3) was only available,\n            which had shown modest improvements given that it measured\n            only the first 2 years of progress. This highlights the need\n            for timely and accurate datasets to be available for target\n            setting and results monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Reproductive and
