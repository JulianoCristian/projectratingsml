Some lessons learned included: the\n            promotion of new and economically viable businesses requires\n            strong long-term technical and organizational support,\n            including rigorous screening of potential agro-businesses.\n            The market analysis is the critical point of a large number\n            of small investment projects in rural areas. Under the\n            project, the level of market analysis was very\n            heterogeneous. In those cases where a link to the market was\n            identified early on, with the establishment of commercial\n            contracts that guaranteed a certain degree of security for\n            the additional production generated by the subproject,\n            subprojects remained functional with increased chance of\n            sustainability. Leveraging maximum impact from resources\n            allocated for subprojects requires the identification of\n            investment proposals in a transparent, strategic and\n            participatory manner, promoting competition for support\n            through targeting mechanisms which ensure high quality,\n            sustainable subproject proposals consistent with project\n            development objectives and sector priorities. When\n            Community-Driven Development (CDD) projects are heavily\n            focused on demand-driven approaches tensions can arise\n            between responding to the communities' needs and\n            building a critical mass necessary for sustained growth and\n            rural development. Implementation arrangements for national\n            programs requiring a strong and massive Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) are not conducive to strong\n            alliances with local-level governments and institutions and\n            decentralization efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Rural Development Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar
