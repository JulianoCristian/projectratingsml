In sum,\n            the impact of the Bank has been satisfactory. Given these\n            results, the projects' outcomes should be seen in a\n            more positive light than that presented by the audit for the\n            first two credits, which rated them as unsatisfactory. Slow,\n            but ultimately realized, policy reforms and subsequent\n            projects addressed the weaknesses of the earlier projects.\n            These projects also had satisfactory outcomes. Indeed, they\n            laid the groundwork for a very fruitful policy discussion\n            that continues today. Their sustainability is likely and\n            their institutional development is strong. The major lessons\n            of these projects are three. First, the sharp decline in\n            Bank support for SMI projects in recent years may have been\n            a missed opportunity. From the review of these projects it\n            is clear that if correctly structured, SMI operations can be\n            effective employment programs. Second, the resolution of the\n            most important problems confronting SMI's in Sri Lanka\n            requires broader financial sector reforms, rather than just\n            more credit, as was emphasized in the last project. However,\n            broader international experience suggests that Sri\n            Lanka's slowness in fully realizing these reforms is\n            not unusual. Finally, international experience also suggests\n            that greater fiscal discipline than has been achieved in Sri\n            Lanka may be a necessary condition for financial reforms to\n            be sustainable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
