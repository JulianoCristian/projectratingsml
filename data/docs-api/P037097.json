This\n            assessment confirms a number of lessons: 1) It is possible\n            to target successfully poor areas for interventions aimed at\n            increasing enrollments, even in times of financial crises.\n            Scholarships administered to the poor and disbursed to them\n            promptly may be effective in sustaining enrollments and\n            preventing dropout. 2) Community involvement may be a\n            cost-effective and reliable means to build and support\n            schools. Nevertheless, school committee members may not be\n            able or willing to keep school expenditures low, may not\n            have much time-to spend on school affairs, and may be unable\n            to advise the principal effectively on educational matters.\n            3) Decentralization promotes effective use of resources.\n            However, a central government may find it necessary to meet\n            the basic educational needs of the poorest communities\n            directly if national goals for basic education are to be\n            achieved. 4) International comparative assessments of\n            student achievement may provide critical feedback to\n            governments interested in increasing the competitiveness of\n            their human capital.

Lessons regarding design specify, and/or\n            reinforce that when school communities manage resources,\n            these are likely to be used more efficiently, being\n            conducive to greater long term participation in school\n            development. Within the framework of decentralization, the\n            Central Government, through the Ministry of National\n            Education (MONE) has a role in targeting strategies, to\n            address the education needs of the poorest communities, if\n            national goals for basic education are to be achieved.\n            Lessons concerning management report that the matching grant\n            mechanism for school quality improvement based on school\n            plans, became problematic when the Government's\n            development budgets were not released on time. Also, schools\n            often found that the price of goods and services had changed\n            between the time of preparing a proposal, and eventually\n            receiving the goods. It took time for schools to learn how\n            to match the books and equipment they ordered, with actual\n            student needs and the teachers' ability to make\n            effective use of them. Lessons regarding the project mapping\n            suggest that expanded access, and other poverty-alleviation\n            programs, and geographic targeting of services, should be\n            done on the basis of poverty. Estimates should be made down\n            to the village level, to benefit from mapping, an excellent\n            technique to support this process, but there should be a\n            pre-commitment to update the \"map\" each year -\n            thereby overcoming the static nature of most poverty map schemes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

material and training for tutors; (c) help to promising but\n            poor students to get access to JSE through the expansion and\n            improvement of the existing scholarship program; and (d)\n            stimulation of the demand for JSE through a social marketing\n            effort; 2) education quality consisting of: (a) provision of\n            training to underqualified teachers; (b) teacher dormitories\n            to insure the presence of teachers in remote areas; (c)\n            construction of library rooms and provision of library\n            books; (d) study of best teaching methods for science\n            education; and (e) establishment of a Student Performance\n            Assessment to provide teachers and principals with academic\n            feedback; and 3) education management including: (a)\n            expansion of the managerial skills of staff at central,\n            provincial, district, sub-district and school levels; (b)\n            improvement of the information management and utilization;\n            and (c) augmentation of the equipment in province and\n            district offices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - East
