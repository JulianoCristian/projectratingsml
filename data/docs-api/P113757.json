Some lessons learned included: the project\n            confirms the effectiveness of phased, long-term support to\n            Government reform processes; the mainstreaming of\n            specialized units for technical support and/or project\n            implementation needs to be carefully detailed with\n            time-bound action plans developed during project\n

manage decentralized\n            services; (b) to improve the availability and predictability\n            of Local Councils' (LCs) funding; and (c) to strengthen\n            the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system. The project\n            has three components: (1) grants to LCs\u0092 to supplement the\n            central budget transfers to LCs; (2) capacity development\n            and technical assistance to strengthen LCs' capacity to\n            perform their core functions and central government capacity\n            to provide adequate strategic guidance and oversight to LCs;\n            and (3) program management component.
