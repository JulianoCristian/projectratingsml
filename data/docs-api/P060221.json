Risks\n            related to macroeconomic environments are outside the\n            control of any given project but affect them significantly.\n            Modal integration remains an important but difficult agenda\n            at the core of all public transport projects. On one hand,\n            this project indicates how difficult achieving good quality\n            integration is despite arrangements that were quite advanced\n            during preparation, despite a functioning regional\n            coordinating committee (an important building block towards\n            modal integration) by the time the project was presented to\n            the Bank Board for approval, and despite repeated assurances\n            from government, integration thus far has only been\n            partially achieved. A lesson is for projects documentation\n            to more explicitly recognize the risks and difficulties\n            related to achieving good integration, even as this issue\n            should continue to be a central focus of the sectoral agenda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Fortaleza Metropolitan Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Fortaleza Metropolitan\n
