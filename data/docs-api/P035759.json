The\n            lessons learned indicate that substantial commitment and\n            support is required from the highest levels of government in\n            a project involving institutional development, the\n            restructuring of the organizations, systems and procedures\n            for economic management and public finance and introducing\n            change on a massive scale in several key ministries and\n            agencies. Comprehensiveness of the reform agenda, as\n            envisaged in the original design, ensured that all relevant\n            areas are covered and all key issues addressed. However, the\n            resultant complexity and extended scope made project\n            implementation very difficult. The availability of qualified\n            and committed high level and influential staff at the\n            Treasury and the Customs departments was a major factor in\n            the smooth and efficient implementation of these components.\n            Bank and the Government counterparts worked closely to be\n            flexible, adjust the project scope and settle for a more\n            gradual pace of reform and more modest objectives in some\n            areas, in order to better match the scope to implementation\n            capacity. As mentioned above, the close linkages between the\n            PFMP and public sector adjustment lending (the PFPSAL\n            program) have been particularly useful in focusing high\n            level Government management attention on the importance of\n            achieving milestones in the PFMP project. Conversely, The\n            project closing date had to be extended by two and a half\n            years to complete the activities under the various\n            components. The time actually taken to introduce changes in\n            the legal framework and organization structures, re-engineer\n            functional processes and introduce new systems, procedures\n            on such a large scale across multiple government agencies\n            needs to be recognized in planning similar projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Public Finance Management

    customs operations. The tax administration component will be\n            directed at modernizing the organization and systems of the\n            tax adminstration in Turkey, with particular focus on\n            strengthening the compliance enforcement and policy\n            formulation capabilities of the tax authorities, and\n            improving conditions progressively for tax payers who\n            comply. The expenditure and personel management component\n            will seek to enhance the government budget's usefulness\n            as a fiscal policy instrument, and as the tool for managing\n            public finances by reducing the number of sources of\n            government spending that now operate outside budgetary\n            channels, and by introducing budgeting of public\n            administration positions and payroll. It also aims to\n            modernize the complex and outdated budgetary and accounting\n            control procedures and sustems that impede effective and\n            efficient control over government finances. The customs\n            modernization component is directed at shifting the customs\n            agency's policy from its present costly and inefficient\n            ex ante, full coverage, sanctioning approach to a more ex\n            post and efficiency seeking stance, still capable of\n            gathering appropriate revenues and enforcing relevant\n            national and international laws, and at advancing the\n            changes in the national customs organization required to\n            enable Turkey to enter into a customs union with the\n            European Union (EU) in 1996. Project activities for the\n            three components can be grouped under five common heads: 1)\n            studies to complete the details of the programs for reform\n            and modernization; b) advisory services and training in new\n            procedures, organizational arrangements and analytical\n            techniques; 3) design studies and modeling activities to\n
