Some lessons learned included: a\n            project implemented in a weak institutional environment\n            needs a powerful champion in the administrative and\n            political apparatus if far reaching reforms addressing\n            multi-sectoral needs have to be implemented. There was a\n            window of opportunity at the end of the conflicts for\n            launching some critical reforms, and the project\n            successfully laid the groundwork for a number of\n            improvements to the institutional environment. However, the\n            Project Coordination and Implementation Unit (PCIU) did not\n            have the means to facilitate the dialogue and complete the\n            reform process. An inter-ministerial committee regrouping\n            all the involved ministries, and presided by e.g. the Prime\n            Minister, could have advanced adoption of the reforms and\n            their implementation. The delays in implementing\n            decentralization reforms also show that reforms should be\n            implemented incrementally and in well defined phases. The\n            post-conflict environment can be used to create conditions\n            for inclusiveness and build a solid base for private sector\n            participation in the reconstruction efforts and for\n            launching reforms. Gradual mainstreaming of project\n            activities into initially weak sector ministries is\n            necessary to assure sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Congo - Emergency

Congo is\n            to assist the recovery of communities living in smaller\n            municipalities and rural areas (i.e. all areas outside the\n            two main cities of  Brazzaville and Pointe Noire). The\n            program comprises four components: (i) Financing of priority\n            local investments; (ii) Support to community organizations\n            (iii) Capacity enhancement for central and local\n            governments; and (iv) Balance of payments support. The\n            Project is  expected to assist Congo's stabilization\n            and recovery process by: (i) contributing to improving\n            living conditions in areas which to date have received\n            limited external support and where poverty is  acute; (ii)\n            helping strengthen civil society in rural areas and small\n            towns; (iii) facilitating the decentralization process and\n            the effective provision of basic social services outside\n            Brazzaville and Pointe Noire; and (iv) helping maintain the\n            pace of economic reforms. The main risks are the possibility\n            of renewed violence in some areas, difficulties on the path\n            to reform, and a compromised administrative capacity for implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Congo - Emergency Recovery and\n            Community Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Congo - Emergency\n
