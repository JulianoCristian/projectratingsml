Uruguay positioned itself\n            as a globally recognized model for effective food safety and\n            surveillance through the establishment of their innovative\n            Animal Tracking System."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)\n            Emergency Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay - Foot and Mouth Disease\n            (FMD) Emergency Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/09/25237872/uruguay-foot-mouth-disease-fmd-emergency-recovery-project","count":"Uruguay","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"beef, emergency, disease outbreak, livestock\n            sector, production, risk reduction, information system,\n            family, national herd, emergency recovery, bank, livestock\n            production, producers, information, exports, animals,\n            agricultural sector, meat industry, meat processing\n            industry, rural economy, agriculture, agricultural land,\n            outbreaks, cattle, health, animal health control, access to\n            markets, food, diversification, food safety issues, meat\n            processing, animal health, slaughtered animals, land,\n            livestock farmers, diseases, animal diseases, risk, rural\n            areas, farms, food safety, meat, sheep, laboratories,\n            products, animal, markets, agricultural, livestock\n            producers, livestock, farmers, outbreak, safety, animal species"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"majtheme":"Trade and integration,Social protection and risk management,Rural development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Proyecto de Recuperaci\u00f3n de\n            Emergencia ante la Fiebre Aftosa"}},"topic":"Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Trade m1326924 698,Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566,Wildlife Resources m1327131 605,Social Development m1327660 134","projn":"UY-Foot & Mouth Disease Emergency\n            Recovery Loan -- P074543","subtopic":"Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Hazard Risk Management,Agribusiness & Markets,Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Rural Poverty Reduction","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Rural Development,Agriculture,Urban Development,Poverty Reduction","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083187076_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Export development and competitiveness,Natural disaster management,Other rural development","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Agriculture,Urban Development,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Trade m1326924 698,Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566,Wildlife Resources m1327131 605,Social Development m1327660 134","owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR)","trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"}},"repnb":"97562"},"12634076":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/06/12634076/uruguay-foot-mouth-disease-emergency-recovery-loan-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/06/12634076/uruguay-foot-mouth-disease-emergency-recovery-loan-project","new_url":"2010/06/12634076/uruguay-foot-mouth-disease-emergency-recovery-loan-project","disclosure_date":"2010-08-20T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/08/10/000334955_20100810025551/Rendered/INDEX/ICR15350P074541Official0use0only191.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/08/10/000334955_20100810025551/Rendered/PDF/ICR15350P074541Official0use0only191.pdf","loan_no":"7070;7421","docdt":"2010-06-26T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2010-08-10T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Foot and Mouth Disease Emergency\n            Recovery Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Foot and Mouth Disease\n            Emergency Recovery Loan Project for Uruguay were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: emergency projects can be an effective\n            tool to assist a country in controlling animal disease\n            outbreaks, provided that conditions exist for a rapid Bank\n            response in terms of project preparation and disbursement of\n            funds. The design of an operation to address the economic\n            emergency caused by a zoonotic event should be sufficiently\n            flexible to combine short-term containment measures with\n            support to strengthen surveillance and prevention systems in\n            order to ensure long-term sustainability and minimize the\n            risk of subsequent emergencies. The development of an\n            individual animal tracking system represents an extremely\n            effective mechanism to ensure adequate epidemiological\n            surveillance and more rapid and effective containment in the\n            event of an outbreak. The establishment of such system will\n            be greatly facilitated by the previous existence of a\n            reliable reporting system for farm livestock inventories and\n            transactions. Enhanced individual tracking systems\n            integrating health and geo-referenced data not only help to\n            manage and mitigate disease outbreaks, but also can\n            represent a valuable tool for on-farm herd management, as\n            well as a source of strategic information on livestock\n            production, logistics, marketing, processing, and food\n            safety issues. Efficient, timely and uninterrupted operation\n            of a Livestock Information System that involves animal\n            tracking can be affected by the rules and regulations of the\n            public service, particularly in terms of procurement\n            procedures, flow of funds and remuneration levels for\n            specialized staff and Information Technology (IT) operators.\n            The achievement of a sustainable national disease free\n            status should also incorporate transboundary disease\n            surveillance and control with neighboring countries. Strong\n            and continuous programs of education and training of the\n            public and private veterinary services as well as farmers\n            and public in general are required to update the evolving\n            sanitary threats. The benefits, advantages and limitations\n            of fast-track additional financing as an instrument to\n            increase project funding should be carefully evaluated to\n            determine if it represents the best option to expand and/or\n            consolidate the outcomes of an emergency operation. If so, a\n            more detailed design and appraisal will be required, in\n            order to incorporate those elements not fully addressed in\n            the original design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Foot and Mouth Disease Emergency\n            Recovery Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay - Foot and Mouth Disease\n            Emergency

strengthening\n            the monitoring, and surveillance capacity in the country, to\n            prevent future outbreaks, and, by identifying alternative\n            markets for Uruguayan beef in the short-run, and restore the\n            country's presence in the premium beef market in the\n            long-run. The project will contribute in minimizing the\n            impacts of the emergency, by defraying substantial,\n            unexpected expenditures incurred in the implementation of\n            the comprehensive containment, and recovery plan.
