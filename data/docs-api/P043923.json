Lessons point at the\n            importance of stakeholder participation in project design,\n            since it is key to promoting ownership of project\n            activities, and gaining support for project interventions,\n            while helping adjust the design, and in addition, provides a\n            source of quality control on project outputs. This was\n            especially true in the teachers participation early on, who\n            contributed to the success of educational reforms.\n            Similarly, consultations with beneficiaries regarding the\n            content of training is key to success; however, it was\n            widely felt, both by trained teachers, and staff of the\n            Ministry of Education, that they were not sufficiently\n            consulted on the selection of their training, perceived\n            sometimes as redundant, or, not at all suitable to their\n            needs. Hence, while the provision of training is not\n            sufficient to guarantee behavioral changes, it does need to\n            run parallel with technical assistance provision, and\n            hands-on classroom work, to allow adequate transmittal of\n            acquired skills. Regrettably, the absence of a local\n            capacity assessment may hinder procurement, and financial\n            reporting guidelines, whereas realistic capacity assessment\n            would conduce to the needed start-up support for an\n            effective implementation. Moreover, the cost of civil works\n            should be based on site-specific construction designs, or\n            alternatively, on price contingencies built into cost\n            estimates to minimize cost underestimates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Grenada -
