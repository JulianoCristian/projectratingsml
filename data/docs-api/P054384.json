The main lessons from these credits are: 1)\n            Small, focused, one-tranche policy projects with realistic\n            objectives, supported by technical assistance, may work well\n            in transition countries that are politically unstable and\n            have low market economy skills. A limited reform agenda is\n            easier to implement, especially if parliamentary approval is\n            needed for new laws when the political landscape is not\n            stable. Reform continuity can be maintained by similar\n            policy or investment follow-on projects. 2) The very quick\n            preparation and disbursement o f PESC was effective in\n            providing development assistance and coordinating\n            substantial humanitarian assistance. 3) Disbursement against\n            a negative list of imports expedited resource transfer,\n            which was appropriate in Albania's circumstances. 4)\n            Aid coordination--including the appropriate alignment o f\n            government agencies--is critical to ensure appropriate,\n            harmonized and effective assistance where many donors are\n            involved. 5) Some organizations established for special\n            purposes under IDA projects could be transformed into\n            private sector commercial entities when their mandate is\n            complete. This transition could be an integral part o f that\n            organization's strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit, Recovery\n            Program Technical Assistance

  development impact substantial. Experience from the project\n            convey the following lessons. In a post conflict\n            environment, a clear strategic framework, and rapid\n            restoration of security provides a solid foundation for\n            project development. The broad nature of the project\n            objectives - implement major structural reforms, both in the\n            financial sector and public administration - was important,\n            as it allowed the project to respond to evolving government\n            needs, and in addition, the project's advisory services\n            provided an anchor of stability, and continuity during\n            successive governments. The strong Government commitment to\n            reform resulted in major sectoral changes in a relatively\n            short period of time, that is within about two years, the\n            Government, with Bank assistance, was able to achieve a\n            major transformation of all three state-owned banks, and\n            establish the foundation for a sound, commercially-based\n            banking system. The strong Government commitment to reform,\n            and ownership of the project, despite several changes in\n            government, were critical elements in the project's\n            success. Moreover, the continuity of the project team, and\n            close Bank supervision in a broad-based technical assistance\n            operation were critical factors in maintaining the momentum\n            of the reform program. The intensity of supervision was\n            particularly important given the lack of experience of the\n            new government, and further helped maintain the momentum of\n            the project during governmental changes. Most important, the\n            continuity of the project team-during appraisal,\n            supervision, and the preparation of follow-up projects -\n            allowed for significant levels of consolidation, and\n            consistency in the implementation of the financial sector\n            reform strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Recovery Program Technical\n

Government's economic recovery program (ERP). The\n            project will also, as part of a broader effort, support\n            institution-building and policy/program formulation,\n            facilitating efficient adoption of future assistance from\n            the international donor community. On a lesser context the\n            project will support elements of civil service reform and\n            strengthening the judiciary. The project has three\n            components: 1) The financial sector component will a)\n            support the restructuring/divestiture of state-owned-banks,\n            and b) strengthen banking infrastructure. 2) The public\n            policy and economic management component, will include,\n            public policy formulation, debt management, public\n            administration reform, and judicial system support. 3) The\n            project management and implementation component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Recovery Program Technical\n            Assistance
