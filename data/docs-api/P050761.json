Some lessons\n            learned included: the HSTAL project appraisal document (PAD)\n            recognizes the need for flexibility to allow for changes in\n            macroeconomic conditions and for adjustments needed as the\n            reform program progressed. At the same time, it includes a\n            very detailed list of activities to be financed throughout\n            the life of the project in the procurement plan formulated\n            at appraisal. These activities were directly linked to the\n            project's monitoring indicators and hence to the\n            results and outcomes. Consequently, the supervision missions\n            spent\u00b7 considerable amount of time and effort following up\n            on completion of the activities (some of which lost\n            relevance as developments in the sector occurred), and less\n            on policy dialogue and capacity building with the Borrower.\n            To the extent possible, a technical assistance operation\n            should remain focused on the strategic objectives and remain\n            flexible regarding the specific activities to be financed. A\n            technical assistance loan to support a programmatic series\n            should avoid emulating the program's project\n            development objective (PDO) since specific investment loan\n            (SIL) is not an adequate instrument to support policy\n            reform. The PDO indicators for the HSTAL were directly\n            linked to sector reform (Subsequent Housing DPL triggers are\n            met, and program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation\n            based on the results of the analytical and technical work of\n            the HSTAL) when reform, as mentioned before is a function of\n            several variables, including but not reduced to relevant\n            studies, workshops or dissemination strategies. In\n            hindsight, a more focused PDO for the project, confined to\n            the outcomes of the TA to be provided and associated (but\n            not linked) to the program objective might have been more effective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Housing Sector Technical Assistance\n            loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Housing Sector Technical\n

Component 2, the Housing Finance Market Development\n            Component, supports improving the legal and regulatory\n            framework for housing loans, including incremental reforms\n            to the existing housing finance system, the future\n            integration of the Brazilian Savings and Loan System into\n            the full market system, and overall strengthening of the\n            market-based Housing Finance System. The focus of technical\n            assistance activities in Component 3, Housing Subsidies for\n            the Poor Component, relating to housing subsidy policy is\n            the rationalization of the Government's various subsidy\n            programs and the establishment of effective targeting,\n            monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms. Component 4, Land and\n            Urban Development, includes the provision of technical\n            assistance for (a) the designing and implementing programs\n            for the Ministry of Cities to strengthen local governments\n            in their efforts to achieve accreditation of their\n            institutional capacity to take the lead in local urban\n            development policy setting and implementation; and (b) the\n            development of a national urban upgrading program,\n            including: (1) research, monitoring, and evaluation\n            activities, at the Borrower's federal level, of policy\n            and regulatory efforts for urban development and land\n            subdivision; and (2)a series of activities to facilitate the\n            implementation of the policy innovations under the Program\n            for progressive housing development, the preparation of\n            local master plans; and the demand-side organization for\n            housing subsidy programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
