The project objectives were met, and, improved\n            management practices were successfully promoted among\n            participating municipalities.

The\n            key lessons show that: 1) pilot municipal projects can be\n            effective tools in helping define a decentralization\n            strategy, since the close dialogue between municipalities\n            and the national government, may strengthen democracy,\n            developing sustainable democratic institutions; 2) even\n            though technical assistance projects may achieve\n            considerable fiscal improvements in individual\n            municipalities, it will not substitute for the adequacy of\n            policy incentives, built into the overall transfer system\n            and legislation, and induce a full scale reform; 3)\n            municipalities have the responsibility to project\n            effectiveness, to be willing to pursue the necessary\n            reforms, and to be involved in every stage, to showcase\n            progress; 4) the involvement of key municipal staff is a\n            strong determinant of reform, for it is their knowledge of\n            the day-to-day operation, that translates into a sustained\n            long-run efficiency; 5) adequate supervision is paramount,\n            to develop a first-hand knowledge of the progress of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile -
