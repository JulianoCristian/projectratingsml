The first Mindanao Rural Development Project\n            (MRDP 1) provides an operational model on how a national\n            sectoral agency like the Department of Agriculture can\n            decentralize functions and responsibilities. 3) Well-defined\n            and constructive partnership between national government\n            agencies and local governments is key to effective\n            devolution. 4) Strengthening grass roots organizations,\n            local governments and communities is vital to meaningful\n            participatory and integrated development. 5) Using regular\n            government personnel, instead of contracted personnel\n            provides for greater institutionalization of project\n            initiatives. 6) Effective operation and use of a\n            well-designed monitoring and evaluation system hinge on the\n            adequacy of the budget, good quality staff, and a high level\n            of prioritization. 7) Disbursements and financial management\n            are better facilitated if  technical implementation and\n            financial management, are tightly linked and monitored by\n            qualified staff right at the beginning of implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Mindanao Rural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Mindanao Rural\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6040096/philippines-mindanao-rural-development-project","projn":"PH-Mindanao Rural Development Project -- P058842","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050701125236"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Micro- and SME finance","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility, agribusiness, Agriculture,\n            Biodiversity, budgetary allocations, Capacity building,\n            civil society, community level, cropping, Currency Unit,\n            Decentralization, development, Development Impact,\n            development management, development objectives, Development\n            Planning, Development Plans, development process,\n            development projects, Development Strategy, diseases,\n            Economic Analysis, empowerment, Exchange Rate, expenditures,\n            farmers, financial services, Fisheries, fisheries\n            development, food security, food supplies, forestry,\n            household income, household surveys, implementing agency,\n            improved access, infrastructure investments, institutional\n            changes, Institutional Development, Irrigation, Irrigation\n            Systems, local governments, local people, microfinance,\n            microfinance institutions, Modernization, National\n            Government, national level, Natural Resources, Nutrition,\n            participatory planning, planning, policy framework,\n            political capital, poor communities, poor households,\n            poverty alleviation, poverty reduction, priorities, private\n            sector, public investments, research institutions, resource\n            allocation, resource constraints, rice, Roads, rural\n            appraisal, rural communities, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, rural\n            growth, rural infrastructure, rural poor, rural poverty,\n            rural poverty alleviation, rural poverty reduction, sector\n            policy, social capital, Social Development, social\n            inclusion, supervision, Sustainability, targeting, technical\n            aspects, technical assistance, technical means, technical\n            support, transport, urban poverty, vulnerable groups, Water supply"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF025069-PHRD-MINDANAO RURAL DEV.

Careful\n            planning will minimize and offset impairment of cultural and\n            historical sites. During the design phase, the area\n            surrounding the spring box and reservoir will be fenced to\n            prevent traffic by people or stray animals and act as a\n            barrier to runoff that could possibly contaminate the\n            source. To reduce soil erosion from exposed areas and\n            deterioration of water quality, soil filled trenches should\n            be compacted and vegetation planted. Flooding of lots and\n            farmlands adjacent to roads will be mitigated by carefully\n            planning drainage facilities, and including bridges, box\n            culverts, reinforced concrete pipes, and side ditches.\n            Properly storing spoils and using silting ponds will\n            alleviate stream sedimentation. Dust will be controlled by\n            spraying road surfaces and imposing speed limits on\n            motorists. No protection measures are recommended to\n            mitigate against deforestation and other losses of\n            agricultural lands and ecology due to road construction, but\n            offsetting actions are planned during spring development. To\n            prevent social conflict arising from water use distribution,\n            limited water rights will be offered.
