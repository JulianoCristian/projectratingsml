The project's financial objectives were\n            only partially achieved: Insofar as the water supply part of\n            the project is concerned, the project has achieved most of\n            its expected development results. However, the project did\n            not achieve its major objectives concerning wastewater\n            pollution because of the failure to complete the wastewater\n            treatment plant before the project closing date and to\n            properly adjust sewerage tariffs as covenanted. Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances were rated deficient overall.\n            Notwithstanding this, overall project sustainability is\n            rated likely. Key lessons learned include: Design institutes\n            for major civil works projects should be selected based on\n            relevant experience. The accuracy of final designs should be\n            assured using actual soil conditions based on comprehensive\n            geological and hydrologic surveys and other relevant\n            documents, and then reviewed by experienced consultants.\n            This would avoid costly design modifications, implementation\n            delays, and expensive change orders. Some other lessons\n            were: An unmanageable number of supervision companies should\n            be avoided; particular attention should be paid to the past\n            experiences of companies in similar projects. Management\n            consultants should participate in the decision-making\n            process. A project should be nominated as a\n            \"demonstration project\" only after it has been\n            completed and proven to meet or exceed expectations, not at\n            the time of
