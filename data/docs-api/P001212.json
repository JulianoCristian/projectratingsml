Substantial progress was made\n            in maritime liberalization, port and customs operations,\n            telecommunications, the investment code, the business laws,\n            the reduction of domestic arrears, and labor legislation.\n            Little or no progress was achieved in the judicial system,\n            tax administration, and the competition committee. Bank and\n            Borrower performances were rated overall as satisfactory. To\n            be successful, privates sector adjustment operations require\n            the continued commitment of all stakeholders concerned. The\n            Government failed to involve the private sector in a\n            meaningful way during program implementation. The private\n            sector felt alienated; its representatives had no say on the\n            way conditions were met. While the commitment of the\n            government to reform was strong overall, its commitment was\n            weak in judicial and tax administration reform. Action plans\n            or committees are no substitute for commitment. The\n            so-called omnibus concept pioneered by this operation served\n            well its purpose of providing funding at regular intervals\n            to support the Government's reform program. Clear and\n            measurable indicators of outcomes and impact should have\n            been defined and agreed upon among all parties concerned for\n            all components of the program. In areas where clear and\n            monitorable indicators are difficult to establish, like the\n            functioning of justice, an effort should have been made to\n            measure the impact, with the private sector participating."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Private Sector\n            Development Adjustment Credit (PSDAC)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire

exports by achieving\n            a critical mass of meaningful structural improvements to the\n            business environment. These objectives will be achieved\n            through the following: 1) reform of the overall legal and\n            regulatory framework, which will improve productivity and\n            reduce business related costs and risks; 2) reduction of\n            specific operating costs and delays and improved quality of\n            the business infrastructure, mainly in the area of transport\n            and utilities; and 3) improved investment and export promotion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Private Sector\n            Development Adjustment Credit
