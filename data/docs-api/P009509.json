Performances by\n            the Bank, and the Borrower were also highly satisfactory,\n            for the project was comprehensively well prepared, enabling\n            up-front resolution of complex issues, and, the\n            establishment of the Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority\n            provided the necessary financial, managerial, and ownership\n            support. But, regardless of success, lessons drawn from the\n            project suggest that: 1) the milestone decision meetings\n            (MDM) proved to be extremely effective through its\n            systematic approach in resolving, and staying focused on\n            specific issues, and, it is thus suggested that MDM should\n            become integrated into project supervision, even if it means\n            higher supervision costs; 2) since projects involving large\n            civil works, require land acquisition, as well as\n            structural, and vegetative clearing, the practice of\n            requiring substantial site readiness before consent of civil\n            works, should become the norm. But greater coordination\n            between the physical preparation, and that of the social\n            components' will be required, so that resettlement, and\n            compensation support becomes effective prior to\n            displacement; 3) co-financing, in addition to counterpart\n            funds, proved effective in funding such a complex project,\n            and useful in reducing financial risks, but co-financing\n            partnerships should ensure that the agreed modus operandi is\n            clearly defined."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Jamuna Bridge Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Jamuna Bridge Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/06/728967/bangladesh-jamuna-bridge-project","projn":"BD-Jamuna Bridge -- P009509","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform,Airports and Air Services,Business in Development,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0008040538152"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access road,access\n            roads,account,accountability,ADB,afforestation,and\n            maintenance,approach roads,auditing,Bank\n            Performance,Bridge,bridge construction,bridge\n            works,bridges,civil works,concrete,construction,construction\n            and operation,construction industry,construction\n            supervision,contractors,corridor,cost estimates,Daily\n            Traffic,debt,depreciation,embankment,embankments,emergency\n            repairs,Erosion,exchange payments,Financial\n            accounting,financial management,financial reports,FISCAL\n            YEAR,flooding,foreign exchange,freight,funds\n            flow,highway,Highways,Hydraulic,impact\n            assessment,income,Institutional Development,Internal Rate of\n            Return,international standards,land\n            acquisition,legislation,navigation,Net Present\n            Value,operation,Operation and\n            Maintenance,passengers,pile,procurement,Quality\n            Assurance,Quality Assurance Group,Regional\n            Office,reporting,reserve,riding quality,River,road\n            infrastructure,road transport,road users,routine\n            maintenance,sharing,speed,structures,subsoil,Technical\n            assistance,toll collection,toll rates,tolls,traffic\n            growth,traffic levels,transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport sector investments,vehicles,viaducts"},"1":{"cdata!":"access road,access\n            roads,account,accountability,ADB,afforestation,and\n            maintenance,approach roads,auditing,Bank\n            Performance,Bridge,bridge construction,bridge\n            works,bridges,civil works,concrete,construction,construction\n            and operation,construction industry,construction\n            supervision,contractors,corridor,cost estimates,Daily\n            Traffic,debt,depreciation,embankment,embankments,emergency\n            repairs,Erosion,exchange payments,Financial\n            accounting,financial management,financial reports,FISCAL\n            YEAR,flooding,foreign exchange,freight,funds\n            flow,highway,Highways,Hydraulic,impact\n            assessment,income,Institutional Development,Internal Rate of\n            Return,international standards,land\n            acquisition,legislation,navigation,Net Present\n            Value,operation,Operation and\n            Maintenance,passengers,pile,procurement,Quality\n            Assurance,Quality Assurance Group,Regional\n            Office,reporting,reserve,riding quality,River,road\n            infrastructure,road transport,road users,routine\n            maintenance,sharing,speed,structures,subsoil,Technical\n            assistance,toll collection,toll rates,tolls,traffic\n            growth,traffic levels,transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport sector investments,vehicles,viaducts"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028184-REG.

The Requesters, the Jamuna Char Integrated\n            Development Project (JCDP), give a history of the Jamuna\n            Bridge Project and express concern over the construction of\n            the bridge, which will require the resettlement of more\n            people than originally thought.  The people that live on the\n            char, or small islands in the Jamuna River, will need to be\n            resettled as a result of the bridge construction, but their\n            resettlement was not included in the original plan. The\n            Requesters state that the Bank's policy disallows\n            involuntary resettlement, but the potential threat of\n            displacement to the char people has not been taken into\n            account. Major concerns involve guide bunds that would cause\n            the river levels to rise and flood the char people's\n            land and homes. The Requesters note that most of the people\n            that would be affected only heard about the construction of\n            the Jamuna bridge through hear-say. While there have been\n            plans to resettle people, the land designated for the\n            resettlement  can only accommodate approximately 20 percent\n            of the people that will need land as a result of the\n            construction.

The Jamuna\n            Bridge Project, meant to span the Jamuna River, will require\n            the resettlement of the char people, who live on small\n            mid-channel islands known as chars. The Request alleges that\n            the char people were not included in the planning and\n            implementation of resettlement and the environmental\n            measures that surround the bridge construction. The main\n            concerns of the Request outline involuntary resettlement of\n            the people and the lack of involvement of the char people.\n            The Management Response maintains that it adhered to the\n            correct policies and procedures and that a phased approach\n            to the construction was implemented to lessen the effects on\n            the surrounding area and people. After examining the details\n            of the Request, the Panel feels that the Request meets the\n            eligibility criteria and reflects legitimate concerns of\n            people that may be adversely affected by the project. The\n            Panel feels that the policies and procedures for\n            resettlement have not been properly followed.
