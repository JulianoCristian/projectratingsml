The working relationship between the\n            International Development Association (IDA) and the borrower\n            was generally good. Generally the project has been\n            successfully implemented although disbursements were much\n            slower than anticipated. The dialogue with the Association\n            on the whole has also been good throughout the project.\n            Although the project was justified, a major shortcoming was\n            the delay in implementing effective highway maintenance. In\n            the past this was the result of slow procurement of\n            maintenance In the past this was the result of slow\n            procurement of maintenance equipment. Another important\n            reason, was very limited Government funds, in turn due to\n            stringent economic conditions and institutional capability.\n            Much of this was not foreseeable at the time of appraisal.\n            Some of the loss of key staff was evident already then, but\n            became worse. In general the Association over estimated the\n            capacity of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) to undertake\n            the project and some earlier technical assistance and\n            solutions like the use of procurement agents may have\n            helped. The lesson learned in this project nevertheless have\n            facilitated implementing the succeeding projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Fourth Highway
