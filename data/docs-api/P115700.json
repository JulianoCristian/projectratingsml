Some\n            lessons learned included: close alignment of the DPL with\n            the government reform program facilitates program\n            implementation. Through this approach, the Bank can help\n            inform the internal and external constituencies about the\n            progress in shifting the strategic direction and prospects\n            of economic transformation in Belarus. A single tranche DPL\n            was the appropriate instrument to scale up engagement in\n            Belarus during the crisis. Strategic technical assistance\n            and analytical support can help greatly with program design\n            and implementation. Given the breath of the reform agenda in\n            Belarus, the Bank should maintain a flexible approach that\n            accompanies the authorities in surmounting the reforms'\n            implementation hurdles. The ability to focus on structural\n            reform in turn will serve to address the external imbalances\n            over the medium term, as an exclusive focus on short-term\n
