The overall\n            performance of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated unsatisfactory. Key lessons can be drawn from the\n            project at the project concept level and the implementation\n            level:  (a) In a volatile political environment such as that\n            which characterized higher education in Senegal in the early\n            90s, it may be imprudent to build an entire reform program\n            on the assumption that the momentum for sectoral reform at\n            the time of preparation would survive for the next 6 years\n            (period of implementation. (b) Therefore, when dealing with\n            tertiary education, it is prudent to phase the reforms, to\n            offer options, and not try to address simultaneously the\n            issues of access control, cost-sharing and internal\n            efficiency. (c) It may be advisable to refrain, at the\n            outset, from overselling financial support to the Borrower\n            and sectoral reforms to the Bank, as the risk of downscaling\n            may materialize, leading to painful adjustments and\n            generating detrimental impact on both sides. (d) Building an\n            operation on a narrow investment basis and loading this\n            operation with far-reaching reforms runs the risk of\n            derailment because of the disconnect between the\n            beneficiaries of the investment and the stakeholders\n            potentially affected by the reforms. A better balance\n            between the investment and the reform agenda mitigates the\n            risk of further disillusions. (e) Operations with extensive\n            reform contents, even when prepared with careful and\n            in-depth consultation, and even when based on solid sector\n            work, do not avoid the risks of a breach or even a reversal\n            of initial political commitments; this is why it is wise to\n            develop exit strategies and back-up positions (alternative\n            scenarios) in order to avoid being cornered in intractable\n            positions. (f) When stakeholders such as students and\n            faculty staff (and their respective unions) are the main\n            beneficiaries, and in addition, have a powerful bargaining\n            power, it is of paramount importance to involve them not\n            only in the discussion of the sectoral measures to be taken,\n            but also in the design of the project and in the operational\n            aspects of its implementation. (g) Politically risky\n            operations require a careful analysis not only of the\n            benefits but also of the threats that they may engender, and\n            of the groups positively and negatively affected. (h)\n            Postponing the detailed definition of key performance\n            indicators, their baseline, mid-term review and target\n            values until after credit effectiveness often proves to bear\n            the seeds of future failure of the monitoring and evaluation\n            system. Instrumentalization of performance indicators should\n            be part of the early design. (i) A perfect match should be\n            reached between appraisal documents and the development\n            credit agreement (DCA) regarding the development objective,\n            IPs and indicators, and task manager should be responsible\n            to ensure that Schedule 2 of the DCA perfectly reflects the\n            corresponding sections of the Appraisal documents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -
