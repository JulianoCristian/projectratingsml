Some lessons\n            learned included: when the health sector is being financed\n            by Government and by several donors, it is important to\n            ensure that these different interventions complement each\n            other, without duplication of efforts. Health services\n            cannot have a favorable and sustainable impact on the\n            population if there are no drugs and if the medical\n            personnel are not qualified and motivated to perform their\n            services. A functional Health Management Information System\n            (HMIS) is important for a project that aims to reduce\n            maternal and child mortality. The establishment and\n            operation of a drug fund must be carefully prepared with an\n            implementation manual covering all aspects, from the list of\n            essential generic
