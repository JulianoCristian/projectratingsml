Some of the lessons learned from this\n            project are: 1) power sector reforms need to be very\n            country-specific in order to produce improved sector\n            performance and increased access to electricity by the poor.\n            The Bank's power sector policy and lending strategies\n            of the 1990s, with their strong emphasis on unbundling and\n            privatization, did not lead to better performance of the\n            sector and increased access, because they were not applied\n            with due consideration to the country's\n            characteristics; 2) private sector participation in major\n            power projects can create significant contingent liabilities\n            for the governments. Therefore, the Bank needs to encourage\n            and help governments to develop an appropriate framework for\n            risk sharing with the private sector; 3) the Bank needs to\n            carefully scrutinize contractor prequalification. In some\n            cases, the Bank might be better off using the services of\n            outside consulting firms instead of relying on its own\n            expertise; and 4) timely midterm reviews (and project\n            restructuring if warranted) are particularly important in\n            infrastructure projects with long implementation periods\n            during which the original objectives and project design are\n            more likely to require changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Third Power Project and\n            Supplemental

institutional development impact as modest, Bank performance\n            as satisfactory, and borrower performance as satisfactory.\n            The outcome of expanding and improving the reliability of\n            power supply was successful, although delays were\n            experienced in the commissioning of the Owen Falls Extension\n            hydropower plant (OFE). However, institution-strengthening\n            efforts and attempts to improve Uganda Electricity\n            Board's operational and financial performance fell\n            short of expectations. The lessons learned include: It is\n            more efficient to initiate and implement measures to improve\n            institutional and financial performance in advance of major\n            new investments. Government ownership of its power sector\n            reform program is a critical underpinning to ensure its\n            successful and timely implementation. The inclusion of the\n            Dispute Review Board (DRB) should be reviewed as it could be\n            counterproductive to the dispute resolution process. The\n            removal of amicable settlement with the introduction of the\n            DRB could also delay the resolution of disputes because if\n            DRB's recommendation were to be rejected, the next step\n            would be arbitration. Procurement capacity should be built\n            prior to commencement of implementation in order to avoid\n            delays caused by poor procurement decisions, as was the case\n            concerning the first civil works contract for OFE."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Third Power Project and\n            Supplemental Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Third Power
