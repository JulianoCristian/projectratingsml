Some lessons\n            learned included: there is need to be candid about the\n            capacity of the client and ability to implement projects\n            with due regard to the full range of Bank requirements. The\n            design of a clear and measurable results framework is\n            critical. Increased attention should be given to safeguard\n            issues and the risks posed on the timely completion of\n            infrastructure investments. The project also highlighted the\n            importance of considering a strategic environmental\n            assessment (SEA) for these types of projects. The challenges\n            associated with operations and maintenance (O and M) were\n            anticipated during project design and included in a\n            covenant; however the project should have provided greater\n            support to cities on capital investment planning and asset\n            management. The development of economic development zone\n            (EDZ) has to be accompanied by significant technical\n            assistance and capacity building to understand the local\n            competitiveness and design effective policies and incentives\n            to attract private investments. Project designs should\n            consider the risk of changes to city and regional master\n            plans. Attention to disaster risk management and climate\n            risks must be given due regarded in infrastructure projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Sichuan Urban Development

Sichuan\n            Urban Infrastructure Project (SODP) for China is to improve\n            core urban functions in an equitable and resource efficient\n            manner by removing identified infrastructure bottlenecks\n            hampering land development, transport, and environmental\n            conditions in four second-tier cities in Sichuan province.\n            On May 12, 2008, the Wenchuan Earthquake hit the province of\n            Sichuan. It was the most damaging earthquake since the 1976\n            Tangshan Earthquake and resulted in almost 70,000\n            causalities, extensive damage and economic losses across the\n            province. Among the 4 cities of the SUDP, Mianyang was the\n            most affected by the earthquake. As a result, the Mianyang\n            Municipal Government received substantial support from the\n            national government for recovery and reconstruction\n            activities. Land use plans were changed to accommodate\n            affected population and economic activities. Domestic funds\n            were used for infrastructure investments originally under\n            the SUDP in both the Southern Economic Development Zone\n            ('SEDZ') and Pioneer Park. The Mianyang Government\n            is to allocate the unused SUDP funds, totaling US$ 11.8\n            million, to infrastructure investments in the Xinglong Area\n            of Pioneer Park.
