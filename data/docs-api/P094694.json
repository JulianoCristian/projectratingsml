The country has made\n            considerable progress in reducing malaria prevalence through\n            a combination of case management, larval habitat management\n            (LHM), wide-scale distribution of free insecticide-treated\n            nets (ITNs), and indoor residual spraying (IRS) in\n            high-prevalence areas. And yet, elimination appears ever an\n            elusive goal, and malaria remains the leading cause of death\n            in children under five. Given these facts, it is vital to\n            enhance existing malaria control programs in order to move\n            towards effective elimination.

Second HIV/AIDS/STI,\n            Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Reproductive Health (HAMSET II) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second HIV/AIDS/STI,\n            Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Reproductive Health (HAMSET II)\n            Project for Eritrea were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: value of repeater projects. Because the\n            first HAMSET project \"invested\" substantially in\n            establishing guidelines and processes and policies, HAMSET\n            II could use existing systems (and improve them), putting\n            the project on a fast-track to realizing gains. Also,\n            because the repeater followed so quickly on the previous\n            project, the government and Bank team were also able to\n            build on the momentum and cumulative experience of the first\n            project's implementation. Bank and client working\n            together as partners during project preparation improves the\n            quality of implementation. This helped to ensure that the\n            project was appropriately designed, feasible, understood by\n            all stakeholders, and owned. In the words of the client:\n            'implementation is easy when you understand it from the\n            beginning'. Continuity of staff and systems in the PMU\n            makes a difference: By HAMSET II close, most staff in the\n            Project Management Unit (PMU) had worked together on HAMSET\n            projects for 10 years. They were very familiar with Bank\n            processes, had honed their own operational skills and\n            procedures, and had become a closely-knit and effective\n            team. There was continuity between the staffing of HAMSET\n            and HAMSET II, with both Task Team Leaders (TTLs) of HAMSET\n            II preparation having led or worked on HAMSET. This\n            contributed to a high degree of trust and ease between Bank\n            and client. The project was implemented using a step-wise\n            approach where annual work plans and budgets were set based\n            on a review of the previous year's activities and\n            performance. This gave the borrower more flexibility to\n            respond to changing conditions and resolve problems as they\n            arose, thus also mitigating risk. The project set long-term\n            objectives to guide implementation, but planned activities\n            over the short-term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea - Second HIV/AIDS/STI, Tuberculosis,\n

HAMSET II aims\n            to: (1) contain the spread o f HIV/AIDS/STI in vulnerable\n            groups as well as the general population through a focused\n            multi-sectoral approach, with renewed attention to the most\n            vulnerable populations; (2) expand the coverage of directly\n            observed treatment (DOT), improve case detection and\n            treatment outcomes for TB; (3) reduce or at least maintain\n            malaria mortality and morbidity at the current low levels;\n            (4) improve the coverage o f effective Reproductive Health\n            (RH) interventions; and (5) strengthen the overall health\n            system, including human resources for health, to enable the\n            country to better address HAMSET diseases. The project has\n            four components: 1. Multi-Sectoral Response: This component\n            supports key (non-health) line ministries and civil society\n            organizations at both national and zoba level to scale up\n            prevention (especially behavior change communication and\n            stigma reduction), care and support interventions for\n            HIV/AIDS/STI, malaria, TB and reproductive health (RH) (with\n            emphasis on mobilizing communities to utilize health\n            services). 2. Health Sector Response: This has five\n            sub-components: HIV/AIDS/STI TB, malaria, RH, and Human\n            Resources for Health. Each o f the first four sub-components\n            will comprise three activity categories: (a) Human resources\n            for HAMSET diseases: HAMSET II will improve human Improve\n            the information base for decision making; (b) Scale up\n            prevention interventions; and (c) Scale up diagnostic,\n            treatment, care and support services; 3. Community Managed\n            HAMSET Response Program: As a continuation of HAMSET's\n            Community-Managed HAMSET Response Program, this component\n            aims to scale up and consolidate community-driven\n            initiatives to address HAMSET diseases including\n            reproductive health. 4.

Some of the\n            report recommendations are : the Government of Eritrea (GOE)\n            should establish a National Steering Committee on\n            Health-Care Waste Management (HCWM) to ensure coordination\n            and supervision of the HCWM Plan at the country level; a\n            National Action Plan should be implemented over a five-year\n            period to progressively upgrade the current HCWM practices\n            at all levels of the Health System;  establish legislation\n            on the Management of Hazardous Wastes (that would consider\n            not only HCW but also other categories of hazardous wastes,\n            such as pesticides, certain industrial wastes, etc);\n            formulate clear National Guidelines for the management of\n            HCW; these guidelines will complement the Eritrean Hospital\n            Standards Clinical Policies and Procedures; designate a\n            Health-Care Waste Management Officer (HCWMO) in large\n            hospitals who should be given the responsibility to operate\n            and monitor the management of the HCW; implementation of\n            standardized segregation procedures to be followed in all\n            Eritrean Health-Care Facilities (HCFs), implementing a three\n            bins system that should be systematically associated with a\n            color coding, and a labeling system; and finally, for all\n            the HCFs, highly infectious wastes generated in medical\n            laboratories and isolation wards, to be chemically\n            pre-treated in a solution of sodium hypochlorite in\n            concentrated forms.
