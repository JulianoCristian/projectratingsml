Lessons indicate that for\n            macroeconomic, and structural reforms to succeed, a stable\n            political environment is essential, as demonstrated by the\n            project experience, when during the country's political\n            stability the economic reform program did progress, in\n            contrast to its deterioration, during the intensification of\n            the ethnic crisis. An effective donor coordination is\n            crucial, particularly in small states under capacity\n            constraints, where implementation of structural reforms is\n            extremely difficult, and can be overwhelmed by a large\n            number of donors. Similarly, assessing the degree of risk in\n            a diversely ethnic state is critical, though extremely\n            difficult: despite the highlighted ethnicity risks at\n            appraisal, it was not possible to measure the depth, and\n            intensity of the crisis, which set back the progress made by\n            reforms, and stabilization efforts. It is suggested that\n            future reform efforts, could include measures to help\n            address the root causes of the crisis, i.e., uneven regional\n            development, in a multi-ethnic country. Moreover, capable,\n            and committed policymakers, are key to a successful program,\n            exemplified by the Prime Minister's commitment to the\n            implementation of the structural reform program; likewise,\n            close dialogue between the Bank, and government\n            counterparts, significantly improve the quality of Bank

    government in response to the economic crisis. The crisis\n            reflects the cumulative effects of years of poor economic\n            management and weak fiscal discipline, exacerbated by the\n            East Asian financial crisis and the collapse of its major\n            export markets for logs. The project will help restore\n            macroeconomic stability and move the economy to a path of\n            sustainable growth and development, while mitigating the\n            social cost of adjustment. The structural reforms will be\n            implemented in the areas of : a) the public sector,\n            reduction of the scope of government, rightsizing and\n            restructuring of government and the civil service, and\n            strengthening of planning, budget, accounting, and\n            monitoring systems; b) the financial sector, normalization\n            of financial

reduce exploitation to sustainable levels, minimize the\n            environmental impact and benefit development; and d) private\n            sector development, measures to stimulate a supply
