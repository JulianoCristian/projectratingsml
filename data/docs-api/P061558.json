Some lessons learned included: private sector\n            participation is a feasible delivery option even in a poor\n            country like Niger, which was able to attract international\n            competition for urban water services and at the same time\n            was able to promote local private operators for rural\n            facilities. Rehabilitation investments, which are critical\n            to the improvement of the services in the context of a\n            Public-Private Partnership (PPP), should be delegated to the\n            lease contractor. This will ensure timely execution and\n            avoid conflicts with the asset-holding companies, which tend\n            to favor large-scale investments. Regulation by contract can\n            coexist with an independent regulatory agency. An\n            independent regulator which does not rely on extensive and\n            discretionary powers, but on adequate regulatory tools (the\n            financial model) can effectively act in favor of the\n            development of water services. Project Coordination Units\n            (PCUs) should not be assimilated to Project Implementation\n            Units (PIUs). PCUs do not act as substitutes to Government\n            departments or agencies and do not hamper capacity building;\n            they are simply a very effective tool for coordinating\n

Following are the\n            project components. 1) The establishment of the Societe du\n            Patrimonie des Eaux du Niger (SPEN), will require technical\n            advisory assistance, and staff training, to attain the\n            complexities of institutional reforms, new tariff\n            structures, and concessionary, and regulatory framework\n            regarding water sales. Studies will be financed on water\n            resource management, i.e., an analysis of alternative\n            strategies, and, integrated monitoring of groundwater\n            pollution in shallow aquifers. 2) Based on technical studies\n            which have identified sector investment needs, urban water\n            networks will be extended, coverage, and private connections\n            increased, and evaluation of service delivery will follow.\n            Included are technical studies, supervision of works, and\n            procurement planning. 3) Extension of rural water supply\n            facilities, management development, and sanitary hygiene,\n            and health education will prod private, and community\n            participation. 4) The urban sanitation pilot program\n            includes rehabilitation/construction of latrines, of school\n            sanitation, stakeholder capacity building, and urban\n            sanitation. 5) An environmental development program will\n            support improved living conditions, through appropriate\n            wastewater disposal, to protect groundwater pollution,\n            improve sanitation systems, and health aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Water Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Water Sector

negative effects. It is anticipated that\n            groundwater stability, surface waters, and related\n            ecosystems will be endangered due to sewerage works;\n            wastewater discharges will affect both urban, and rural\n            environments; income revenues will be affected by the loss\n            of productive agricultural land; and, public health may be\n            temporarily affected as a result of unsafe sanitary\n            conditions. Mitigation measures include: 1) regular\n            systematic monitoring of groundwater, and aquifers, to\n            ensure long-term safety of the water resources, to be\n            controlled by the Ministry of Water Resources; 2) water\n            treatment facilities will be designed to control sludge\n            disposal, under the aegis of the Ministry of Hydraulics,\n            and, appropriate technical specifications within the bidding\n            documents will enforce sludge treatment processes, for the\n            safe production of drinking water; 3) compensation for land,\n            or income losses, will be reimbursed by the Societe du\n            Patrimonie des Eaux du Niger; 4) public awareness, and\n            sanitary hygiene education will be promoted to minimize\n            health hazards. Precautionary clauses in the bidding\n            documents will ensure air, and noise abatement, to ease\n            temporary construction nuisances; and; 5) vegetative\n            propagation, and reforestation will be implemented under the\n            supervision of the Ministry of Water Resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - State Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Sector Study Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger \u2013 Projet d\u2019\u00e9tude du secteur\n            public d\u2019approvisionnement en eau et d\u2019assainissement :\n            \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/12/6673325/niger-state-water-supply-sanitation-sector-study-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"NE-Water Sector Project -- P061558","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Groundwater","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Niger","authors":{"authr":"Pigeon, Jean-Luc, Environmental Consultant Engineer"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060321142534"},"subsc":"Water Supply & Sanitation Adjustment,Water supply,Sanitation,General public administration sector,Other Water Supply & Sanitation","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Groundwater\n            protection; Aquifers; Ecosystems; Sewerage; Surface waters;\n            Wastewater treatment plants; Drainage systems; Sludge\n            treatment; Agricultural land; Losses; Land degradation;\n            Vegetative propagation; Reforestation; Compensation; Income\n            restoration; Monitoring techniques; Technical\n            specifications; Procurement guidelines; Public awareness;\n            Sanitation; Hygiene; Public health surveillance; Air\n            pollution control; Noise abatement,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Groundwater\n            protection; Aquifers; Ecosystems; Sewerage; Surface waters;\n            Wastewater treatment plants; Drainage systems; Sludge\n            treatment; Agricultural land; Losses; Land degradation;\n            Vegetative propagation; Reforestation; Compensation; Income\n            restoration; Monitoring techniques; Technical\n            specifications; Procurement guidelines; Public awareness;\n            Sanitation; Hygiene; Public health surveillance; Air\n            pollution control; Noise abatement,"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13),AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020912-AFRICA WATER RESOURCES\n            MANAGEMENT INITIATIVE,TF035896-NIGER - PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT","repnb":"E384"},"facets":{}}}
