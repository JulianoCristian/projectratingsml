The key lessons learned\n            include: 1) Success of the project can be attributed to both\n            the Borrower's and the Bank's approach to the\n            project. The Bank utilized a multidisciplinary team of an\n            economic/financial analyst, a port engineer, and a marine\n            environmental specialist. This provided a consistency\n            throughout the project, from design and appraisal to\n            implementation. Further, 10 Chinese agencies and ministries\n            were involved in the project. 2) Port and coastal\n            environmental management is inherently complex due to\n            overlapping jurisdictions of different departments and\n            ministries, port authorities, and private interests. If\n            China did not already have a strong and existing regulatory\n            base upon which the project could be constructed, coupled\n            with good leadership from Ministry of Communications, the\n            project would have been much more difficult to implement and\n            would likely have required more time. 3) The success of a\n            ship waste project can be enhanced by a) adoption of an\n            environmental coastal zone and port management plan; b)\n            implementation of other pollution control activities; and c)\n            control and management of land-based sources of pollution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Ship Waste Disposal Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Ship Waste Disposal

The project\n            consists of two components: a national component and a ports\n            component.  The national component will: 1) establish\n            baseline data on international ship traffic, related waste\n            types and quantities through a pilot interport ship waste\n            monitoring system (SEATRACK); 2) prepare a comprehensive\n            accident (oil pollution) contingency plan for each port; 3)\n            initiate a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) monitoring program\n            for the Yellow Sea; 4) undertake a study of the treatment of\n            chemically contaminated water; 5) upgrade environmental\n            monitoring capabilities at the ports, coastal waters and\n            international waters; and 6) provide consultant's\n            services and training.  The port's component will: i)\n            define, design, and provide land-based collection and\n            disposal facilities at the ports of Dalian, Tianjin,\n            Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen and Guangzhou; and ii) upgrade\n            environmental monitoring and enforcement capabilities of\n            each of the port authorities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Ship Waste Disposal
