The assessment\n            shows the difficulties of implementing projects affected by\n            a major exogenous shock, and a number of lessons can be\n            drawn on how problems were addressed. To summarize, lessons\n            suggest the following: 1) the formulation of realistic and\n            measurable project objectives is crucial, and when there is\n            a major restructuring of a project, the task team should\n            take the opportunity to review the original objectives in\n            light of changed circumstances; 2) Bank supervision\n            arrangements should be realistic, and budgets should be\n            higher when projects are decentralized, or spread over a\n            wide area involving more than one implementing agency.\n            Project design should take this into account; 3) covenants\n            should not be imposed on authorities that do not have the\n            legal power to carry out the commitment. Weak or open-ended\n            conditionality should be avoided, and objectives should not\n            be conflicting; and, 4) it is unwise to involve local,\n            sub-national borrowers with the foreign exchange risks in\n            unstable macroeconomic conditions, especially when their\n            revenues are in the local currency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia - Urban Transport and Bridge\n            Rehabilitation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russia - Urban Transport and\n            Bridge Rehabilitation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/5872732/russia-urban-transport-bridge-rehabilitation-projects","projn":"RU-Urban Transport -- P008806,RU-Bridge Rehabilitation Project -- P035764","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050620101345"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,General transportation sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets, Bank management, Bank Performance,\n            Bank supervision, bankruptcy, BRIDGE, Bridge Management\n            System, BRIDGE REHABILITATION, Bridges, bus, bus industry,\n            Buses, car ownership, Cities, City Administration, city\n            authorities, city planners, commuting, concrete,\n            construction methods, corrosion, cost of capital, cracking,\n            debt, decentralization, employment, fare evasion, fare\n            revenue, fares, final report, financial management, Fiscal\n            Year, foreign exchange, fuel, fuel consumption, Highways,\n            icing, inflation, Institutional Development, interchanges,\n            land use, legislation, macroeconomic conditions, metro\n            systems, mobility, municipal governments, national roads,\n            natural resources, net benefits, operating costs, passenger\n            kilometers, passenger transport, passenger transport\n            operations, Passenger Vehicles, peer review, private\n            operators, public expenditures, public transport market,\n            public transport operations, public transport operators,\n            Public Transport Reform, public transport vehicles,\n            Railways, regulatory reform, revenue sources, road\n            authorities, road sector, road systems, road users, roads,\n            routes, safety, safety grounds, safety standards, service\n            provision, stakeholders, steel, structural elements,\n            structures, subsidiary, Technical assistance, Timber,\n            traffic, traffic congestion, traffic levels, trams,\n            transparency, transport capacity, transport projects,\n            transport sector, trips, trolleybuses, urban passenger,\n            urban passenger transport, urban passenger transport sector,\n            Urban Public Transport, URBAN TRANSPORT, Urban Transport\n            Project, urban transport reform, urban transport sector,\n            urban transport services, urban transport systems, walking,\n            water leakage, waterproofing"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF031911-RUSSIA - TRANSPORT,TF032988-RUSSIA - TRANSPORTATION,TF033067-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY REHABILITATION\n            AND MAINTENANCE PROJECTS,TF033472-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY REHABILITATION\n            & MAINTENANCE PROJECTS,TF033799-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY, BRIDGE REHABILITATION,TF033973-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY REHAB.

The performances of the Bank\n            and the Borrower were overall satisfactory. Four out of six\n            lessons drawn from this Project concern the imperative of\n            striving for coherence, first within the project design\n            itself (i.e. between its objectives, instruments, measures\n            of performance, legal stipulations), then between the\n            project design on paper and the reality of activities and\n            relations in the field (\"external\" coherence), and\n            finally the relation of both of these to the project budget.\n            These lessons are not new, and some corrective actions in\n            terms of operational policies have been taken since this\n            Project was approved, notably the use of design aids such as\n            the LogFrame. Still, the subject being difficult, presenting\n            these lessons is warranted, even if some repetition is\n            involved, especially if the examples involve the\n            \"external\" coherence and relations to the budget.\n            !) The first lesson has to do with a comparison between the\n            efforts (resources) expanded under a project for some\n            activity and the importance that activity has in the\n            objectives and outcomes scheme. It stands to reason that\n            activities which consume large resources should be reflected\n            in the project design as explicit entries in the objectives\n            and outcomes framework. 2) The second lesson involves a\n            situation which is the inverse of the preceding one, i.e.\n            that an activity present in the objectives and outcomes\n            framework does not have a realistic budgetary dimension. The\n            follow-up activities could not have been much more intense,\n            given the number of cities and the distances involved. This\n            has posed multiple problems with supervision, first because\n            the absence of frequent contacts reduces the policy\n            interaction with the clients, and also for the monitoring of\n            outcomes (the two are linked). The supervision budgets being\n            largely given and modest at best, the difficult lesson of\n            this experience is that the policy focus of projects should\n            be placed where a solid supervision presence is assured. 3)\n            The third lesson concerns the links between the policy\n            agenda and the institutional power to make the relevant\n            changes. The lesson is to place the onus of a condition\n            where there is power to make a change.  4) The fourth lesson\n            has to do with weak conditionality, which is a notable\n            feature of the Loan Agreement for this Project.5) The fifth\n            lesson has to do with economic evaluation of investments\n            involving fleet replacement and expansion for public\n            transport services. Doing post-investment evaluation of\n            fleet replacement in the context of Bank lending requires a\n            considerable and expensive effort, which should be\n            anticipated while projects are prepared and negotiated, and\n            recorded formally in loan/project agreements. 6) The sixth\n            lesson is drawn from the experience with sub-loan arrears in\n            1999, following the collapse of the ruble against the\n            dollar. Most of the client cities had no recourse but to\n            step out of the Project. The Bank 's standard advice to\n            the client governments is not to pass the foreign exchange\n            risk to sub-national entities whose revenue sources are\n            limited to domestic currency. A compromise was made in this\n            project, at the insistence of the finance ministry, and it\n            would have been preferable not to do this."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation -
