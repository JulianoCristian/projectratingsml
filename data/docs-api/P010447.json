Subsequent debt\n            rescheduling and improvements in macro management have also\n            reduced the threat of default. Even though debt service\n            levels remain high, sustainability of these net benefits is\n            rated likely. Institutional development is negligible.\n            Overall, both Bank and Borrower performance are rated\n            unsatisfactory.  SAL's outcome is rated as moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Improvements in loan repayment have been\n            sustained and are likely to continue. Even though debt\n            service levels remain high, sustainability of these net\n            benefits is rated likely. Institutional reform was\n            negligible. Because of the failure to implement the reform\n            program, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. The\n            problems with SAL reflect a lack of broad-based commitment\n            in Pakistan, not the program design; Bank performance is\n            rated satisfactory.  Overall, outcome of SAC I is rated\n            satisfactory, and sustainability of project achievements is\n            likely. Overall institutional development impact is rated\n            modest. Performance o f both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. The overall outcome of SAC II is rated\n            as moderately satisfactory, and sustainability of net\n            project benefits is rated likely. SAC II had important\n            institutional objectives in tax administration, public\n            financial management, civil service reform, procurement, and\n            utility restructuring and regulation. Overall institutional\n            development impact is rated modest. Both Bank and Borrower\n            performance are rated satisfactory.  The main lessons from\n            these loans are: 1) Effectiveness of a series of one-tranche\n            loans depends on a willingness to withhold lending until a\n            critical mass of previously-agreed prior actions have been\n            undertaken. The delay between the SAL and the first SAC was\n            particularly effective in this respect.2) Complex or\n            politically difficult sector reforms are best supported\n            through dedicated sector operations. A multi-sector\n            operation can play only a secondary or facilitating role\n            when dealing with institutional development (as in tax\n            reform or civil service reform), deep-rooted reluctance to\n            reform (as in power), need for specific funding to offset\n            costs of adjustment (as in banking), or weak service\n            delivery (as in health and education)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Public Sector Adjustment\n            Loan/Credit Project (PSAL), Structural Adjustment Loan\n            Project (SAL), and the First and Second Structural\n            Adjustment Credit (SAC I and SAC II) Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Public Sector\n            Adjustment Loan/Credit Project (PSAL), Structural Adjustment\n            Loan Project (SAL), and the First and Second Structural\n            Adjustment Credit (SAC I and SAC II) Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6500732/pakistan-public-sector-adjustment-loancredit-project-psal-structural-adjustment-loan-project-sal-first-second-structural-adjustment-credit-sac-sac-ii-projects","projn":"PK-Structural Adjustment Credit II -- P074968,PK-Public Sector Adjust -- P010447,PK-Pakistan-Structural Adjustment Loan (Ln.\n            4435) -- P090474,PK-Structural Adjustment Credit -- P071463","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Country Strategy & Performance,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20051228094447"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Power,Oil and gas,Primary education,Health,General energy sector,Banking,Petrochemicals and fertilizers,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Project Evaluations","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Energy and mining,Finance,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB, adjustment loans, Auditing, Banking\n            Sector, banking system, borrower, borrowing, civil service,\n            commitment, conditionality, Consumer Price Index, cost of\n            capital, creditworthiness, debt, debt management, debt\n            service, deficit spending, deregulation, devaluation,\n            Development Finance, Economic Cooperation, economic growth,\n            economic recovery, economic reform, employment, Enhanced\n            Structural Adjustment Facility, exports, Extended Fund\n            Facility, Financial Institutions, financial management,\n            fiscal deficits, fiscal management, fiscal reform, foreign\n            exchange, foreign exchange reserves, GDP, Gross Domestic\n            Product, growth rate, Institutional Development, interest\n            payments, interest rates, lending operations, LOAN,\n            LOAN/CREDIT, London Club, macroeconomic policies,\n            macroeconomic stability, natural resources, opportunity\n            cost, peer review, price increases, price setting, private\n            sector, Privatization, PUBLIC, public expenditure, public\n            finance, PUBLIC SECTOR, public sector management, Public\n            Service, public spending, resource mobilization, revenue\n            collection, SAL, Second tranche release, social services,\n            STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT, surcharges, takeover, Tax, tax\n            administration, tax collection, tax reform, taxation, trade\n            liberalization, Tranche, transparency"}},"owner":"Econ.

First,\n            lessons of experience from previous adjustment operations\n            need to be built into the design of succeeding operations.\n            Second, care must be taken by the Bank to avoid sending\n            unclear or mixed messages to a Government regarding the\n            prerequisites of adjustment lending. Third, it may take\n            years to prepare adequately to seize a moment. Fourth,\n            covenants should be concentrated only on measures which the\n            Bank has existing in-depth knowledge. Fifth, adjustment\n            operations can be designed with a \"process\n            approach\". Sixth, the design of reform programs should\n            be replete with ID measures to strengthen both near-term and\n            long-term implementation capacity. Seventh, supervision\n            should be forward looking and focused not so much upon\n            details of compliance and actions taken as upon problem\n            solving and implementation assistance. Finally, governance\n            is generally crucial to sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Public Sector Adjustment\n            Loan/Credit
