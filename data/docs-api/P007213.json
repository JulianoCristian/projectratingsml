The\n            project will have two specific objectives. The first will be\n            to improve the efficiency, accountability, and transparency\n            of the financial management functions of the public sector\n            through implementation of an Integrated Financial Management\n            System (SIAF) centered in the Ministry of Finance and a\n            modernized Government Auditing System (SAG) in the\n            Comptroller General's Office. The second objective will\n            be to improve the delivery of public services by supporting\n            decentralization to line ministries of primary\n            responsibility for management of their financial resources.\n            The project comprises three major components: 1) reform of\n            financial management policies and procedures supported by\n            outside technical assistance; 2) investment in information\n            systems involving the purchase and installation of computer\n            hardware and software systems; and 3) a training

The\n            project will have two specific objectives. The first will be\n            to improve the efficiency, accountability, and transparency\n            of the financial management functions of the public sector\n            through implementation of an Integrated Financial Management\n            System (SIAF) centered in the Ministry of Finance and a\n            modernized Government Auditing System (SAG) in the\n            Comptroller General's Office. The second objective will\n            be to improve the delivery of public services by supporting\n            decentralization to line ministries of primary\n            responsibility for management of their financial resources.\n            The project comprises three major components: 1) reform of\n            financial management policies and procedures supported by\n            outside technical assistance; 2) investment in information\n            systems involving the purchase and installation of computer\n            hardware and software systems; and 3) a training component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Integrated Financial Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Integrated Financial\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/05/732689/guatemala-integrated-financial-management-project","projn":"GT-Integ Finan Mgt -- P007213","subtopic":"Public Sector Economics,Public & Municipal Finance,National Governance,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Urban Economics","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Guatemala","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008025920"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,authorization,Basic\n            Education,budget,budget formulation,cash management,central\n            government,Competitive Bidding,corruption,debt,debt\n            management,decentralization,decision\n            making,decision-making,Decree,execution,financial\n            administration,financial assistance,financial\n            capacity,financial information,Financial\n            Management,financial resources,FISCAL,government\n            ministries,government officials,government\n            programs,government revenues,Gross Domestic Product,Human\n            Resources,Human Resources Development,institutional\n            capacity,institutional weaknesses,internal audit,Iron,lack\n            of transparency,legal framework,legislation,local\n            governments,managers,ministers,Ministries of\n            Finance,Ministries of Health,Ministry of Finance,national\n            elections,National Planning,Nations,primary health\n            care,public expenditures,public funds,public sector,public\n            sector reform,representatives,social programs,social\n            sector,social services,tax,tax administration,tax compliance,transparency"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,authorization,Basic\n            Education,budget,budget formulation,cash management,central\n            government,Competitive Bidding,corruption,debt,debt\n            management,decentralization,decision\n            making,decision-making,Decree,execution,financial\n            administration,financial assistance,financial\n            capacity,financial information,Financial\n            Management,financial resources,FISCAL,government\n            ministries,government officials,government\n            programs,government revenues,Gross Domestic Product,Human\n            Resources,Human Resources Development,institutional\n            capacity,institutional weaknesses,internal audit,Iron,lack\n            of transparency,legal framework,legislation,local\n            governments,managers,ministers,Ministries of\n            Finance,Ministries of Health,Ministry of Finance,national\n            elections,National Planning,Nations,primary health\n            care,public expenditures,public funds,public sector,public\n            sector reform,representatives,social programs,social\n            sector,social services,tax,tax administration,tax compliance,transparency"}},"owner":"Public Sector (LCSPS)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF027780-PHRD-INTEGRATED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT-HEALTH,TF028893-IDF-GUATEMALA TA FOR CIVIL\n            SERVICE REFORM","repnb":"P6598"},"facets":{}}}
