Some lessons learned included:\n            establishment of the community production groups (CPGs) and\n            community seed funds as the coordinating mechanism and\n            umbrella organizations proved to be positively accepted and\n            understood by beneficiaries. This form of cooperation during\n            the course of land reforms can be extended at later stages\n            and viewed as the first step to successfully establishing\n            producers or farmers association. Close coordination between\n            all parties can be invaluable to a project\u0092s success.\n            Effective project management and good support from food and\n            agriculture organization of the United Nations (FAO)\n            headquarters resulted in the timely delivery of seed and\n            fertilizer to Dushanbe. Local non-governmental organizations\n            (NGOs) played a critical role in overall implementation\n            throughout the project\u0092s life, from selecting beneficiaries\n            and distributing input packages to providing training and\n            extension needs to the CPGs and other farmers and monitoring\n            project implementation. Where the capacity and resources of\n            local government are limited, project design that involves\n            active local government support should be accompanied by an\n            adequate allocation of project resources to guide and\n            support local government in the implementation of these\n            roles and responsibilities. Project teams need to be\n            realistic in their expectations of the various processes,\n            especially those concerning the procurement process and the\n            time it can generally take to complete these processes\n            including within the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan -
