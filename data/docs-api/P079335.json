Some lessons learned included: the\n            pilot rural public works program proved very useful in\n            laying the foundation for International Development\n            Association (IDA) to respond promptly to evolving country\n            priorities and scale up safety nets support in the face of\n            shocks. This underscored the importance of having scalable\n            safety nets systems in place before the onset of shocks in\n            order to respond effectively and in a well-targeted manner.\n            In fragile states, requiring counterpart funding from\n            Government can be counter-productive, especially when other\n            forms of ensuring government ownership are possible.\n            Government provision of counterpart funding became a problem\n            soon after the project commenced, as noted in the 2005\n            Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR). Government\n            displayed other signs of ownership, and implementation will\n            have proceeded more smoothly with 100 percent Bank\n            financing. The implementation of a sustained and tailored\n            capacity building program was important in fostering\n            community participation with local government in all stages\n            of the subproject cycle in a post conflict environment. The\n            creation of Project Management Committees (PMCs) served as a\n            catalyst in mobilizing communities to effectively\n            participate and perform their oversight and monitoring\n            functions. This in turn strengthened a sense of ownership\n            and led to sustained support to operations and maintenance.\n            The restoration of infrastructure and essential services, in\n            addition to their own merits, also generated social benefits\n            by promoting cohesiveness, rebuilding trust and fostering\n            community engagement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone -

Sierra Leone emerged from a ten year civil war in\n            2002 with most of its basic infrastructure in ruins,\n            particularly in the rebel-held areas. Following the war, it\n            had the lowest Human Development Index in the world. The\n            National Social Action Project (NSAP) was designed to\n            provide an immediate and a tangible response to the gaps in\n            basic service availability, with the priority on the areas\n            and populations most affected by the war. The project was\n            set to maximize the capacities of local civil society,\n            communities and local governments. NSAP had restored\n            infrastructure and services, and built capacity for\n            collective action in war-affected and poor communities in\n            Sierra Leone. Over 7 million people had gained access to\n            health facilities, 3.6 million children to educational\n            facilities, and over 1.15 million people to economic\n            infrastructure such as markets. In addition, an emergency\n            Cash-for-Work program was introduced as a new component in\n            the project, and as a response to food price increases. Over\n            30,000 people, including unemployed youth, female-headed\n            households and vulnerable rural and urban households were\n            benefitted from the program. NSAP was successful in driving\n            significant increases in access to services for\n            beneficiaries, and mitigating risks of renewed conflict at\n            the level of communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Restaurar el acceso a servicios b\u00e1sicos en\n            Sierra Leona de posguerra"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone -

Sierra Leone emerged from a ten year civil war in\n            2002 with most of its basic infrastructure in ruins,\n            particularly in the rebel-held areas. Following the war, it\n            had the lowest Human Development Index in the world. The\n            National Social Action Project (NSAP) was designed to\n            provide an immediate and a tangible response to the gaps in\n            basic service availability, with the priority on the areas\n            and populations most affected by the war. The project was\n            set to maximize the capacities of local civil society,\n            communities and local governments. NSAP had restored\n            infrastructure and services, and built capacity for\n            collective action in war-affected and poor communities in\n            Sierra Leone. Over 7 million people had gained access to\n            health facilities, 3.6 million children to educational\n            facilities, and over 1.15 million people to economic\n            infrastructure such as markets. In addition, an emergency\n            Cash-for-Work program was introduced as a new component in\n            the project, and as a response to food price increases. Over\n            30,000 people, including unemployed youth, female-headed\n            households and vulnerable rural and urban households were\n            benefitted from the program. NSAP was successful in driving\n            significant increases in access to services for\n            beneficiaries, and mitigating risks of renewed conflict at\n            the level of

objective of the Co-financing of the\n            National Social Action Project  for Sierra Leone is to\n            assist war-affected or otherwise vulnerable communities to\n            restore infrastructure and services, build local capacity\n            for collective action, and assist vulnerable households to\n            access temporary employment opportunities, with priority\n            given to areas not previously serviced by the government,\n            newly accessible areas (those which were under rebel control\n            until January 2002), food insecure areas, and the most\n            vulnerable population groups within those areas. The\n            rationale behind the co-financing will be to capitalize on\n            the solid performance of the International Development\n            Association (IDA)-funded National Social Action Project\n            (NSAP) to put in place and scale up safety net interventions\n            to help the poor cope with the drastic increases in food\n            prices in Sierra Leone. Global food prices have increased 26\n            percent over 2004 - 2007, and food crop prices are expected\n            to remain above 2004 levels through 2015. The average export\n            price for rice, for example, increased from US$375 per\n            metric ton in January 2008 to US$775 per metric ton by June\n            2008. In Sierra Leone, rice is the main staple food in both\n            urban and rural areas; furthermore, the country produces\n            only two thirds of the national consumption (355,000 metric\n            tons per year), with the shortfall sourced though imports\n            and food aid. As such, Sierra Leone is particularly\n            vulnerable to rising food prices and the Food and\n            Agriculture Organization (FAO) has listed Sierra Leone as\n            one of the eight most vulnerable food deficient low income\n            countries globally in the current food prices crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Co-financing of the National\n            Social
