The lessons learned indicate that support of\n            an already ongoing reform process provides legitimacy and\n            increases commitment to project development objectives,\n            which facilitates implementation. The Reform Fund enables\n            the Bank to accompany the Palestinian Autorities PA's\n            reform program beyond the life of the adjustment operation.\n            The Bank's AAA program played a key part in helping the\n            PA prepare and internalize the necessary reforms. The\n            adjustment operation, and the accompanying Reform Fund are\n            based on a common performance assessment framework and a\n            joint review process, which harmonize general budget support\n            of nine donors. While the overall reform program is quite\n            ambitious, the Bank kept individual benchmarks simple and\n            realistic.

It supports\n            the same reform program, and requires the same prior actions\n            for Board presentation. This operation recognizes the very\n            significant progress that the Palestinian Authority (PA) has\n            made in improving the quality of its financial management,\n            and supports further improvements in this area. The\n            operation is intended to provide budgetary support to the PA\n            during a period of acute economic, and fiscal crisis,\n            therefore it will help leverage contributions from other\n            donors, by encouraging them to channel their funding through\n            the new trust fund. The project seeks to help the PA avoid\n            fiscal insolvency, contribute to the economic rehabilitation\n            of the West Bank and Gaza, and, help advance the broader\n            hope for peace, and stability in the region. There are\n            nevertheless, internal and external risks to the program.\n            Internally, two risks worth noting: first, it is the risk to\n            the management of funds - however, as expressed in the\n            recent Country Finance Accountability Assessment, a number\n            of improvements, i.e., internal audit, financial control and\n            payroll functions, provide assurance on eligible and\n            budgeted expenditure spending; second, there is a political\n            and administrative risk that the PA's public financial\n            management reform program, could lose momentum, and stall.\n            And, externally, there is a risk that the PA will be unable\n            to obtain enough funding to cover its revenue gap, placing\n            the operation effectiveness in doubt."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza -
