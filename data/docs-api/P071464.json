Some lessons learned\n            included: a supportive regulatory environment is crucial for\n            overcoming risk aversion to adopting new financing\n            instruments for energy efficiency projects, creating a level\n            playing field for a competitive Energy Service Company\n            (ESCO) market, and to ensure sustainability of energy\n            services. Ensuring reliable means for verifying energy\n            savings provides a clear basis for sharing the resulting\n            gains between the beneficiary and the financing source, and\n            therefore incentivizes energy efficiency efforts. The Energy\n            Efficiency project was unable to stimulate the ESCO market\n            beyond some sectors in the public domain due to remaining\n            regulatory and legal constraints (as for example in the\n            residential sector).

Some lessons learned included: creating an\n            enabling regulatory framework for Renewable Energy (RE)\n            investments is challenging, complex, and time-consuming even\n            when the government is fully committed to the task. Support\n            to RE development therefore needs to be sequenced carefully\n            with well-defined milestones to be reached before moving\n            into pre-investment and investment support stages. An\n            enabling regulatory framework with clear financial\n            incentives such as the introduction of guaranteed\n            preferential prices (feed-in-tariffs) for RE is a key\n            prerequisite for creating investor interest in RE projects\n            and without it other activities to stimulate an RE market\n            will have limited impact. This means that a pipeline of\n            projects will only be credible once such a framework is in\n            place. Once an enabling regulatory framework is in place,\n            investors are prepared to borrow funds on a contingent loan\n            basis for pre-investment activities such as feasibility\n            studies (including site-specific resource assessments,\n            environmental impact studies, due diligence and legal\n            documentation) and a contingent loan (to be forgiven if\n            project does not reach financial closure) can be a key risk\n            mitigation device for small, local developers. A centralized\n            registry of potential renewable energy projects, such as the\n            one built and maintained by Ministry of Economy, Labour and\n            Entrepreneurship (MoELE), is a valuable tool in managing\n            information useful to investors in a transparent way. It has\n            created a large number of applications that form the basis\n            for a solid pipeline of projects that can enable the country\n            to reach its RE

resources in Croatia.\n            Development of this market will support Croatia in its\n            European Union (EU) accession efforts. Under the level two\n            restructuring, no changes are proposed to the project's\n            development objectives, outcomes, design, or scope. The\n            restructuring proposes only an extension of the grant's\n            closing date to enable signing of already prepared contracts\n            under component one (contingent loan facility) and related\n            disbursements under component two (contingent loan\n            facility). Currently, 45.66 percent of the grant has been\n            disbursed, and with a two-month extension of the project\n            closing date the final disbursement is expected to reach 65\n            percent. The remaining undisbursed funds will be canceled.\n            One of the main reasons why the project will not reach full\n            disbursement is related to delays during the project's\n            initial stages due to the late adoption of secondary\n            legislation that established feed-in tariffs for renewable\n            energy, licensing, and permit procedures--a prerequisite for\n            the launch of the project's second component and an\n            important precondition for the development of a renewable\n            energy market.
