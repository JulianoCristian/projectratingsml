The lessons learned from this project\n            were that the direct tangible benefits of the policies and\n            of the training for improved efficiency and health outcomes\n            will only become visible several years after Credit closing.\n            Reforms in the health sector not only concern technical\n            health-related changes, but depend heavily on institutional\n            capacity and the political process. Despite several policy\n            papers, legislation and related documents to support these\n            financing reforms, the Health Insurance Agency has not\n            become operational. Consensus building among stakeholders is\n            critical, not only during preparation but during\n            implementation as it can affect the success and\n            sustainability of any reform. Finally, they last lesson\n            learned was that the Bank founds that they should adopt a\n            longer-term approach in supporting such reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan : Health
