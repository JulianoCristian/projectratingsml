The\n            Bank's assistance was appreciated on clarifying policy\n            questions relating to the appropriate urban tenure\n            instruments, cost recovery, pricing and standards.

The institutional problems\n            encountered during the implementation of this project,\n            stemming largely from inadequate arrangements for housing\n            have been fully analyzed and documented in the Housing\n            Sector Review, 1988.

The project will provide for the\n            expansion of the two towns, and help direct public\n            investment to the greater benefit of low-income people.\n            About 38,000 people will benefit from the residential\n            component of the project, and about 1,250 jobs will be\n            created or upgraded. The main risk facing the project is the\n            economic uncertainty surrounding the two towns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana - Second Urban Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Botswana -
