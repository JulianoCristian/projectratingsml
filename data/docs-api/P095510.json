Some lessons learned included: the adoption of\n            environmental sustainability as a cross-cutting priority\n            faces many challenges. Maintaining the importance of\n            environment as an entity itself, while also mainstreaming\n            environmental concerns into all sectors, require delicate\n            intervention and coordination between many stakeholders.\n            This approach required the adoption of key sustainability\n            principles in each sector involved and the selection of\n            specific actions contributing to this end. Under\n            Mexico's fiscal policy, loans do not increase aggregate\n            fiscal resources available to the environment and other\n            sectoral agencies since the fiscal envelope is defined by\n            the binding primary fiscal surplus targets. This represents\n            a limitation to participation since some sectors perceive\n            this type of operation as a burden rather than an incentive.\n            To ensure that inter-institutional coordination efforts are\n            sustained it is essential that an entity take a leading role\n            in overseeing these efforts, particularly as participating\n            entities undergo an initial learning process and define\n            their functions within inter-sector working groups.\n            Clearly-defined baseline and target values to monitor\n            progress and evaluate outcomes, as well as a relevant set of\n            measurable and meaningful outcome indicators, are essential\n            for a results driven

The overarching objective of the\n            DPL operation is to balance socio-economic development with\n            environmental protection and improvement. The operation will\n            complement actions supported by the recently approved\n            climate change DPL and will further pursue the general\n            objectives of a previous Environment DPL Program, by\n            integrating environmental concerns in the sectoral policies\n            and programs of key development sectors: tourism, energy,\n            forestry, water, agriculture, and housing as prioritized by\n            the government of Mexico (GOM). The original Environment DPL\n            Program supported environmental mainstreaming in four of\n            these sectors (tourism, energy, forestry, and water); the\n            other two (agriculture and housing) have been included at\n            the GOM's request. Macroeconomic risks are associated\n            with effects on the Mexican economy of: (i) a sharper\n            slowdown of the US (and global) economy, decelerating growth\n            of non-oil exports and reducing the flow of workers'\n            remittances, (ii) higher levels of international commodity\n            and food prices leading to further pressures on domestic\n            inflation, (iii) increased uncertainty with respect to\n            credit conditions for the access of emerging markets to the\n            international capital markets, and (iv) declining oil\n            production. However, several factors are in place to reduce\n            these risks, including: a healthy financial system that has\n            begun to expand domestic credit as a share of GDP; more\n            dynamism in exports to non-US destinations; favorable terms\n            of trade with high oil prices; and the further consolidation\n            of prudent macroeconomic policies in both the

departments of Public Administration and\n            Federal Coordination and who were in the Ministry of\n            Environment and Natural Resources. The objective was to\n            analyze the implications for sustainable development issues\n            as diverse as water management, development of financial\n            instruments for the sound management of forest resources,\n            strategies for development of tourism with sustainability,\n            tax incentives for proper utilization of natural resources\n            and environmental protection. To meet the social needs of\n            the population, to promote the growth of the economy and\n            also to incorporate into development policy the\n            preservation, protection and rational utilization of\n            ecosystems and the environment requires the integration of\n            sustainability into public policy building. Faced with\n            environmental degradation and destruction and degradation of\n            natural resources, the alternative is not extreme\n            conservation and implementation of legal constraints.\n            Rather, exercise of authority simply is not enough in a\n            society characterized by deep inequalities and deprivation\n            for large groups of people. Therefore, the federal\n            government has promoted the mainstreaming in public policies\n            to build a situation which has great impact on natural\n            resources and the environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Descentralizacion de la gestion ambiental"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Descentralizaci\u00f3n de la gesti\u00f3n ambiental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/01/10944951/descentralizacion-de-la-gestion-ambiental","projn":"MX-Mexico Environmental Sustainability\n            Development Policy Loan -- P095510","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,National Governance,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Governance","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20090812154116"},"theme":"Climate change,Water resource management,Environmental policies and institutions","subsc":"Forestry,Other industry,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General energy sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Governance","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Archaeological sites;

It provides an analysis on the impact of the\n            adoption of fiscal instruments in environmental public\n            finances and the tax system in general. Such requirements\n            are analyzed in this study. It tries to provide elements for\n            discussion on the impacts of fiscal environmental taxes and\n            charges. The study brings international experiences into the\n            debate theory for the type of instruments to be used to\n            foster recovery and deterioration of ecosystems, and how\n            they should be allocated funds from the. The work was\n            divided into three chapters. In Chapter I the paper surveyed\n            the major environmental projects implemented since the\n            public finances, noting the changing context in the country\n            and the most significant results that have been achieved.

Finally, in\n            Chapter III the paper presents a model to evaluate the main\n            impacts of implementation of an environmental tax and the\n            application model results that are estimated to levy a tax\n            on pesticides, and two variants of taxes on tires. Each\n            chapter integrates specific conclusions and finally provides\n            a summary of the main benefits of the study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Impacto de los instrumentos fiscales ambientales"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Impacto de los instrumentos\n            fiscales ambientales"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2005/05/10948266/impacto-de-los-instrumentos-fiscales-ambientales","projn":"MX-Mexico Environmental Sustainability\n            Development Policy Loan -- P095510","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,National Governance,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Governance","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20090813101112"},"theme":"Climate change,Water resource management,Environmental policies and institutions","subsc":"Forestry,Other industry,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General energy sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Governance","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Archaeological sites; Decentralization;\n            Development policy; Environmental protection; Institution\n            building; Investment operations; Nongovernmental\n            organizations; Regional development; Rural\n            developmentauthorization,capacity building,central\n            government,citizen participation,community action,community\n            development,community health,community members,community\n            participation,Councils,Currency\n            Unit,Decentralization,decision-making,districts,Ecology,electrification,employment,Environmental\n            protection,execution,expenditure,federal agencies,federal\n            governments,financing mechanisms,FISCAL,government\n            expenditures,government officials,Government\n            performance,government services,health workers,implementing\n            agency,incentive structures,income,Institutional\n            capacity,Institutional Development,institutional\n            mechanisms,learning,levels of government,local\n            government,local governments,local level,Monitoring\n            system,municipal governments,national levels,policy\n            dialogue,poor communities,poverty alleviation,Poverty\n            targeting,presidents,primary school,Programming,public\n            investment,quality\n            standards,rehabilitation,representatives,resource use,rural\n            areas,rural communities,rural electrification,rural\n            infrastructure,rural poor,Rural Poverty,sector policy,short\n            term,Social Development,social programs,social\n            services,state agencies,State government,state\n            institutions,state planning,Sustainable\n            Development,technical assistance,training\n            activities,transparency,urban areas,water supply,water\n            supply projects"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"trustfund":"TF052820-TFESSD ENVIRONMENT WINDOW : LCR\n            STRATEGIC PROGRAM ON ENVIRONMENTAL MAIN,TF055408-PHRD-MEXICO: PROGRAMMATIC\n            ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN III (ENVD","majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management","repnb":"49695"},"facets":{}}}
