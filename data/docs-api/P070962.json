In 1995, the government sold\n            the mines to private investors. Although privatization\n            brought many benefits to the economy, the new mine owners\n            did not want to take care of the environmental liabilities\n            left over by previous mines\u2019 owners. In 2003, fifty thousand\n            residents of Kabwe\u2019s population were affected by high lead\n            levels in the soil, due to naturally occurring\n            mineralization as well as the impact of the smelting and\n            mining operations. Although mining has been the single\n            greatest contributor to economic growth in Zambia, it has\n            also had significant adverse effects on the environment. Its\n            effect on the environment had been largely ignored, thus\n            leaving a trail of uranium, lead and other base metals whose\n            by-products were not properly disposed of and administered.\n            CEP determined and controlled lead blood levels in affected\n            areas. It also helped to strengthen the institutional\n            capacity of delegated authorizing agencies to improve future\n            compliance of the mining sector with environmental and\n            social regulations. The International Development\n            Association (IDA) financed environmental project helped to\n            clean up lead and uranium tailings from mines in Zambia and\n            enabled the residents of Kabwe live in safety."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Copperbelt Environment Project tackles the\n            lead and uranium danger in Zambia"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Copperbelt Environment Project\n            tackles the lead and uranium danger in Zambia"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/25202192/copperbelt-environment-project-tackles-lead-uranium-danger-zambia","count":"Zambia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"libraries, social mitigation, waste, lead\n            contamination, communities, lead, subsidence, economic\n            growth, hazardous materials, materials, shelter,\n            participation, sustainability, electricity, privatization,\n            homes, environmental impacts, mining sector, mines, water\n            supply, housing, health, mining community, project,\n            projects, environment, towns, uranium, mining communities,\n            mining assets, mining activities, mining, underground\n            mining, copper, land, gravel, clinics, drinking water,\n            mining operations, residential areas, public participation,\n            intervention, hammer mills, mineralization, base metals,\n            water, soils, residences, houses, markets, community, mine\n            owners, copper mines, environmental, safety, female, metals, tailings"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management","projn":"ZM-Zambia Copperbelt Environment Project\n            (Cep) -- P070962","topic":"Nonmetallic Mineral Mining and Quarrying\n            m1326877 1700,Industry Laws and Regulations m1327712 970,Licensing and Contracting of Minerals\n            m1327348 560,Industry Analytics and Diagnostics\n            m1326714 1231,Extractive Industries Transparency\n            Initiative m1326194 2281","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Environmental Economics & Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Wastewater Treatment","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Industry","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08316c996_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Pollution management and environmental health","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Industry","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Nonmetallic Mineral Mining and Quarrying\n            m1326877 1700,Industry Laws and Regulations m1327712 970,Licensing and Contracting of Minerals\n            m1327348 560,Industry Analytics and Diagnostics\n            m1326714 1231,Extractive Industries Transparency\n            Initiative m1326194 2281","owner":"Envir & Nat.

Some\n            lessons learned included: It was appropriate for the Bank to\n            focus on providing financing for the remediation of\n            large-scale mining-related environmental liabilities and\n            obligations under the first Project. In light of the\n            profitability of the mining industry, though, Bank financing\n            in the case of a second Project should play more of a\n            leveraging role, i.e. mobilize substantial financial\n            contributions from the Government, ZCCM-IH (Zambia\n            Consolidated Copper Mines Limited- Investments Holdings\n            Plc), and mining companies. Under the first Project, mining\n            communities in the Copperbelt Province and Kabwe did not\n            adequately benefit from the thriving mining sector. To this\n            day, they continue to struggle with adverse mining-related\n            environmental and public health impacts, poor access to\n            basic social infrastructure services, and poverty. Mining\n            companies should contribute to a fund that would enable\n            communities living adjacent to mines and mineral processing\n            plants to be proactively involved in the design and\n            implementation of small-scale community-level investments\n            that would improve local living and environmental conditions\n            and livelihoods. Explicit emphasis should also be placed on\n            addressing gender issues. More emphasis should be placed on\n            fostering social accountability: (i) 'supply side'\n            governance through more access to information, in particular\n            data on environmental compliance and revenues of mining\n            companies; and (ii) 'demand side' governance by\n            which civil society plays an active role in pollution\n            monitoring and holding the Government accountable for\n            enforcing environmental laws and regulations and holding\n            mining companies to environmental standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia -

Through the environmental management facility (EMF)\n            component, environmental and social problems resulting from\n            the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd.

A\n            consolidated environmental management plan (CEMP) will be\n            prepared, to identify priority financing, and provide the\n            criteria for funding subprojects. Moreover, this CEMP will\n            form the basis for managing environmental issues related to\n            the Copperbelt, and Kabwe over a 25 year period, within the\n            broader context of environmental, and social sustainability.\n            The second component, will strengthen the environmental\n            regulatory framework, by providing assistance to the\n            Government, to ensure that historical, and future\n            environmental liabilities arising from mining activities,\n            are handled in compliance with national environmental, and\n            social safeguards. To this end, capacity building will be\n            supported, namely at the Environmental Council of Zambia,\n            and authorizing agencies, so as to review environmental\n            impacts assessments, negotiate management activities with\n            investors, issue pollution permits, monitor compliance, and\n            collect fees and fines.

The primary environmental health issue in the\n            Copperbelt mining sector is exposure to sulfur dioxide and\n            particulate emissions in Mufulira, Kitwe, and Chambishi.\n            Copper is found in excessive quantities downstream from mine\n            sites.
