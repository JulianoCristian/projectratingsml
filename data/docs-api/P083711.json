The institutional development impact was\n            moderate with unsatisfactory performance by the Bank and\n            highly unsatisfactory by the Borrower. Lessons learned from\n            the IRSC experience and similar public finance reform\n            programs indicate the importance of combining policy lending\n            with comprehensive support in the areas of capacity-building\n            and technical assistance. A second lesson concerns the\n            program-budgeting process. Ideally, the preparation of\n            program-budgets should be a two-phase process: 1)\n            preparation of draft programs to help the government make\n            appropriate decisions about overall budget priorities; and\n            2) sector ministries should review again their\n            program-budgets with a view to optimizing the use of funds\n            available to their sector. For the future, the budget\n            preparation process should start with: (i) identification by\n            the government of its overall strategic priorities and (ii)\n            early issuance of the budget circular defining\n            inter-sectoral allocations. A third lesson concerns the role\n            of the civil society and the feasibility of supporting\n            independent oversight institutions. The Bank should continue\n            to give a high priority to building the capacity and\n            protecting the independence of trade unions and other civil\n            society representatives which, if successful, can help\n            develop a culture of transparency in the management of\n            public resources. A fourth lesson concerns the need to move\n            more forcefully towards result-based indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Institutional Reform Support Credit\n            (IRSC)

and\n            Fifth Structural Adjustment Credits (SAC IV and SAC V), the\n            Chad Institutional Reform Support Credit (IRSC) supports the\n            completion of a medium-term reform program focusing on two\n            of the five strategic axes identified in Chad's full\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, namely to promote good\n            governance; and ensure strong and sustained growth. The\n            reforms supported by the IRSC aim to enhance poverty\n            reduction by: (1) promoting good governance, including: (a)\n            enhanced transparency, accountability and adherence to the\n            rule of law; and (b) using public resources transparently,\n            accountably, and efficiently through reforming budget\n            preparation, execution, monitoring and reporting, public\n            procurement, and human resource management in the civil\n            service; and (2) causing sustainable growth in rural areas\n            through a profound reform of the cotton sector. The IRSC\n            focuses on key elements that underlie improved public\n            service delivery through improvements in budget preparation,\n            execution, and monitoring and better human resource\n            management in the civil service. The reform process\n            supported by the IRSC will pay particular attention to\n            empowering the independent institutions that provide the\n            checks and balances for the efficient management of\n            resources for poverty reduction in the executive,\n            legislative, and judicial branches of government, as well as\n            in the media and civil society, including farmers'\n            associations. Finally, the IRSC will complement and enhance\n            the impact of other Bank interventions, especially the\n            Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, and it s\n            associated capacity-building program for petroleum revenue\n            management the Management of the Petroleum Economy Project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad -
