The\n            project achieved its major objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was satisfactory while the Borrower's was marginally\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, advance procurement actions should be tied\n            up with the various stages of project processing. Second,\n            CEB's financial authority to handle procurement\n            decisions should be enhanced. Third, during the initial\n            stages of project preparation, comprehensive training\n            programs with the objective of overall institutional\n            strengthening should be developed and agreed upon. Fourth,\n            security risks should be properly evaluated and works in\n            security prone areas should not be included in the scope of\n            future projects. Fifth, efforts should be made by the CEB to\n            develop local contractors for the erection of power lines\n            and sub-stations.
