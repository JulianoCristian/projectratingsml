The following lessons may be\n            derived from this project. First, the success of the project\n            indicates that, in order to effectively respond to natural\n            disasters such as drought, there are two principal\n            requirements: (a) there needs to be a structure in place at\n            the local level through which the relevant government\n            departments and non-governmental actors can meet speedily to\n            address the situation and coordinate their actions; (b) that\n            body needs to have some resources, not necessarily\n            substantial, to fund initial measures to address the\n            identified problems, so that response is not delayed by the\n            need to obtain resources through normal bureaucratic\n            channels. Second, the statement of project objectives is\n            important. Care should be taken by both the Bank and the\n            Borrower to ensure that the objective statement is clear and\n            does not become blurred by vaguely stated goals. This is\n            especially important when, for example, though the project\n            may be broadly targeted to assist the poor, the nature of\n            its interventions is such that it will be difficult to\n            demonstrate whether it has met a specific poverty objective.\n            Third, in operations like this one, it is important to\n            design, at the outset, performance indicators to track\n            qualitative as well as quantitative progress on achievement\n            of objectives, or to agree at the outset on specific steps\n            to monitor performance in meeting qualitative objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -

The components remained the same throughout the\n            implementation period, however the drought management\n            component was enhanced at the mid term review with the rapid\n            response fund at the district level.  The project, through\n            its approach to addressing the risk and vulnerability of the\n            arid lands populations, achieved its objective of building\n            the capacity of communities to better cope with drought.\n            Lessons learned include the following.  Risks can be managed\n            and the livelihoods of vulnerable, populations living in\n            drought prone areas can be improved, through an effective\n            drought management system (containing decentralized\n            planning, decision making, financing and implementation\n            system at district level, supported by a responsive and well\n            coordinated national body).  The strengthening of district\n            level multi-sectoral institutions can significantly improve\n            the effectiveness of project interventions on the ground.\n            Capacity building is an important investment and should\n            include all key project actors and be carried out on a\n            continuous basis. Broader access to social services in the\n            arid lands can only be achieved by strengthening communities\n            and supporting actors to provide appropriate and\n            cost-effective facilities.  Project support of women's\n            income generating activity groups should continue and be\n            further expanded."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Arid Lands Resource Management
