 expertise, proved decisive, and diligent in achieving\n            success; 3) the adequate project design defined simple\n            components, complementary to the policy reform program; and,\n

The project consists of\n            three components. The policy support component supports\n            development of a legal and regulatory framework. The\n            infrastructure development component provides technical\n            assistance, equipment and facilities investments to\n            establish and strengthen the securities depository,\n            registry, clearing and settlement facilities.
