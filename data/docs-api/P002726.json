those established under the Smallholder Tea Development\n            Project; (ii) maximize the production benefits of\n            smallholders in those areas where an alternative to tea\n            planting is not available; (iii) strengthen TTA's\n            financial viability; and (iv) increase Government's\n            export earnings from the tea industry. Specifically, the\n            project will finance construction of one new factory;\n            extending and reequipping of five factories; transport\n            facilities; spare parts; workshop tools; establishment of\n            fuelwood plantations; planting of 200 ha and infilling of\n            the equivalent of 630 ha of tea; construction and\n            maintenance of 176 km of tea roads; and incremental staff\n            and technical assistance for TTA. The major risk of the\n            project is institutional deficiencies; this risk has been\n            minimized through the provision of technical assistance in\n            the key positions of factory operations.

- Smallholder Tea Consolidation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Smallholder Tea Consolidation\n            Project will, over a five-year period, consolidate ongoing\n            TTA operations and provide additional processing facilities.\n            It will aim to (i) strengthen TTA's capacity to handle\n            green leaf produced by smallholder tea plantings including\n            those established under the Smallholder Tea Development\n            Project; (ii) maximize the production benefits of\n            smallholders in those areas where an alternative to tea\n            planting is not available; (iii) strengthen TTA's\n            financial viability; and (iv) increase Government's\n            export earnings from the tea industry. Specifically, the\n            project will finance construction of one new factory;\n            extending and reequipping of five factories; transport\n            facilities; spare parts; workshop tools; establishment of\n            fuelwood plantations; planting of 200 ha and infilling of\n            the equivalent of 630 ha of tea; construction and\n            maintenance of 176 km of tea roads; and incremental staff\n            and technical assistance for TTA. The major risk of the\n            project is institutional deficiencies; this risk has been\n            minimized through the provision of technical assistance in\n            the key positions of factory operations. The forecasts of\n            world tea prices have been conservatively projected based on\n            key producing countries' abilities for expansion of tea production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Smallholder Tea Consolidation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Smallholder Tea\n            Consolidation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/05/726394/tanzania-smallholder-tea-consolidation-project","projn":"TZ-Smallholder Tea -- P002726","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Food & Beverage Industry,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912484387"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            inputs,Agricultural Marketing,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Products,Agricultural\n            Services,Agriculture,Audit Reports,Audits,bananas,book\n            value,cash crops,cashewnuts,CGIAR,coffee,cotton,crop,crop\n            production,cropping,dairy products,development\n            projects,Development Strategy,dividends,Economic Rate of\n            Return,eggs,Environmental Benefits,Equipment,export\n            crops,exports,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,Farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fermentation,fertilizers,fish,fisheries,food\n            crops,food grains,food\n            production,foodgrains,forestry,fruits,Fuelwood,GDP,GNP,harvesting,harvests,husbandry,Income,income\n            distribution,international agricultural\n            research,juices,liquidity,livestock,livestock\n            research,Maize,MOA,overhead\n            costs,Plantations,Planting,population\n            growth,produce,production costs,production\n            increases,rice,Rural Development,rural population,rural\n            roads,sisal,sugar,Tea,tea factories,tea industry,Tea\n            Markets,tea prices,Tea Research,technical assistance,the\n            Consultative Group,tobacco,UNDP,vegetables,water supply,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            inputs,Agricultural Marketing,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Products,Agricultural\n            Services,Agriculture,Audit Reports,Audits,bananas,book\n            value,cash crops,cashewnuts,CGIAR,coffee,cotton,crop,crop\n            production,cropping,dairy products,development\n            projects,Development Strategy,dividends,Economic Rate of\n            Return,eggs,Environmental Benefits,Equipment,export\n            crops,exports,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,Farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,fermentation,fertilizers,fish,fisheries,food\n            crops,food grains,food\n            production,foodgrains,forestry,fruits,Fuelwood,GDP,GNP,harvesting,harvests,husbandry,Income,income\n            distribution,international agricultural\n            research,juices,liquidity,livestock,livestock\n            research,Maize,MOA,overhead\n            costs,Plantations,Planting,population\n            growth,produce,production costs,production\n            increases,rice,Rural Development,rural population,rural\n            roads,sisal,sugar,Tea,tea factories,tea industry,Tea\n            Markets,tea prices,Tea Research,technical assistance,the\n            Consultative Group,tobacco,UNDP,vegetables,water supply,wheat"}},"owner":"WB Off:DaresSalaam-Eastern AFR 1 (AFCE1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"2814"},"facets":{}}}
