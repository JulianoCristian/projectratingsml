The project outcome of the\n            Enterprise And Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project\n            (TAL) is moderately satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory.\n            For the Capital Markets Development Project (CMDP), outcome\n            is rated moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability is\n            unlikely; institutional development impact is modest; and\n            both Bank and Borrower performance are unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons of general applicability include the following: 1)\n            Without complementary measures for facilitating entry and\n            exit, maintaining hard budgetary constraints, and imposing\n            corporate managerial accountability, privatization is\n            unlikely to produce significant growth or productivity\n            benefits. 2) Troubled banks should be liquidated or\n            privatized quickly, and their lending strictly controlled\n            while in that process. 3) The experience with the EFSAL\n            suggests that, although additional delays may be incurred\n            and costs increased, on balance long-run development\n            benefits are likely to be enhanced by canceling projects\n            with major design flaws and addressing the reform needs with\n            a superior instrument. 4) Development of domestic capital\n            markets makes little sense, until basic issues for private\n            sector development, such as privatization and financial\n            stabilization, have been resolved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -

This project was designed as an\n            ancillary project, intended to facilitate implementation of\n            the Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (EFSAL),\n            and therefore should be viewed in that context. To some\n            extent, delays in implementing policy reforms of the EFSAL,\n            particularly in the energy sector, have diminished the\n            impact of some of the preparatory activities financed under\n            the TAL. Project sustainability, where applicable, is\n            considered likely: policy dialogue continues and it appears\n            that the new Government is committed to continuing reforms\n            in order for Croatia to become a full-fledged market\n            economy. World Bank performance in all aspects of the\n            project cycle was satisfactory while the performance of the\n            Borrower's implementing agencies was, overall,\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned include the following: The\n            flexibility in TAL's design allowed project\n            implementation to continue both when technical assistance\n            priorities changed and when alternative financing was found.\n            The project management structure was adapted specifically to\n            support the government's large reform program. The fact\n            that several implementing agencies were each given\n            responsibility for executing their own components avoided\n            creation of a bottleneck which would have appeared had all\n            procurement gone through the Project Implementation Unit\n            that was managing a second Bank-financed project at the same time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -

Specifically, the\n            objectives of the project are: 1) to assist the government\n            to complete the privatization of former socially-owned\n            enterprises (FSOEs); 2) to help in the restructuring and\n            privatization of public enterprises (PEs) through studies\n            and advisory services; and 3) to support the rehabilitation\n            and privatization of the banking system. The components of\n            the project are the following: 1) privatization of FSOEs,\n            including the recruitment of consultants/privatization\n            advisors; 2) restructuring and privatization of PEs, which\n            will consist of: (a) the hiring a financial analyst and an\n            audit expert to assist the Office for the Restructuring and\n            Economics of State-owned Enterprises (ORESE); (b) a Kutina\n            Fertilizer Company, strategic planning and restructuring\n            study; (b) an Industrija Nafte (petrochemical company)\n            study; (c) complementary studies in the power sector; (d) a\n            tariff study for the Croatian Post and Telecommunications;\n            and (e) a spectrum management study; and 3) rehabilitation\n            and privatization of the banking system comprising: (a) a\n            legal advisor for the Bank Rehabilitation Agency (BRA);
