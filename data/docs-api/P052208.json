Lessons learned from the project: Project\n            development objectives need to be aligned with project\n            content. An effective monitoring and evaluation system\n            should be priority of the borrower and the Bank.\n            Borrower's effective commitment is essential to achieve\n            sector reforms. Borrower's ownership of policy is\n            necessary to ensure operations efficiency and\n            sustainability. Clear criteria of staff performance and\n            qualification should lead to decision on their selection and\n            replacement, for a result-driven action. Bank's\n            decentralization policy facilitates continuous dialogue and\n            closer follow-up of the project's implementation.\n            Borrower's commitment to more transparency improves\n            sector's governance. Implementation arrangements need\n            to be adjusted as necessary. The Bank should be more\n            realistic when expecting results, especially for such\n            projects requiring thorough institutional changes and\n            vulnerable to staff rotation and change of decision makers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
