Some lessons learned included: this\n            project offered Haiti the opportunity to join the first ever\n            regional catastrophe insurance pool and thereby secure\n            immediate liquidity in case of covered disasters\n            (earthquakes and hurricanes). It is part of a broader\n            development agenda of Bank support aimed at reducing the\n            vulnerability of Haiti and other Caribbean island countries\n            to natural disasters. After three years of operations,\n            several lessons can be drawn from this project. Risk\n            modeling tools to assess financial exposure to natural\n            disasters can provide loss estimates in dollar terms that\n            can help Ministries of Finance better understand and compare\n            threats to their fiscal balance and sensitize them to the\n            need for more pro-active disaster risk management\n            strategies. The analytical process can help increase\n            interaction between Ministries of Finance, national\n            emergency management agencies, and hydrological and\n            meteorological institutes. In the present case,\n            International Development Association (IDA) financing for\n            Haiti's participation fee and insurance premium during\n            the first three years of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk\n            Insurance Facility's (CCRIF's) operation allowed\n            the Haiti to join the CCRIF and test its value at without\n            cost and risk to itself. IDA finance also served as a\n            vehicle to deepen the Bank's dialogue with Haiti on its\n            broader and longer-term disaster risk reduction and climate\n            change adaptation strategies. The quick cash injection a\n            natural disaster is effective only if the country's\n            post-disaster budget execution system allows for an\n            immediate use of these funds. Countries should be encouraged\n            to conduct a disbursement test for a simulated disaster and\n            possibly further improve their post-disaster budget\n            execution system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Catastrophe Insurance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Catastrophe Insurance

the\n            country\u2019s most vulnerable to adverse natural events. The\n            emergency recovery and disaster management project (ERDMP)\n            was approved in 2005 and augmented with additional financing\n            in 2008 to strengthen the capacity of the national disaster\n            risk management system, in particular the directorate of\n            civil protection (DPC), to prepare for and coordinate public\n            response to a natural emergency. The DPC used its new\n            resources to coordinate a response that successfully\n            mitigated effects of the devastating 2008 hurricane season,\n            during which four major storms over a three-week period\n            affected 865,000 people and forced 130,000 into shelters.\n            This will ensure that disaster risk management is\n            mainstreamed as a core component of programs for sustainable\n            poverty reduction and economic growth.

This will be\n            achieved by providing financing to Haiti to allow it to join\n            the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF)\n            and purchase financial protection against catastrophic\n            earthquake and/or hurricane events. Without the IDA grant,\n            it is unlikely that Haiti would join this pilot initiative,\n            which represents the first entity created to protect small\n            island states from the financial impact of natural\n            disasters. The project has two main components with the\n            first being to assist Haiti in joining the CCRIF through the\n            financing of the entrance fee. This fee is equal to the\n            first year\u0092s insurance premium of US2.57 million. The second\n            project component is payment of annual insurance premium\n            which will assist Haiti in purchasing the catastrophe\n            insurance coverage offered by the CCRIF during the first\n            three years. As such, the project supports the establishment\n            and viability of the CCRIF."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Catastrophe Insurance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Catastrophe Insurance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/02/7407032/haiti-catastrophe-insurance-project","projn":"HT-Haiti Catastrophe Insurance -- P104690","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Insurance & Risk Mitigation,Banks & Banking Reform,Natural Disasters,Financial Intermediation,Non Bank Financial Institutions","teratopic":"Environment,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Haiti","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020439_20070221163058"},"subsc":"Non-compulsory pensions and insurance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"attachment point, Basis risk, bonds,\n            borrowing, capital markets, catastrophe reinsurance,\n            catastrophic events, catastrophic risks, contractual\n            savings, cost of capital, debt, Disaster, Disaster\n            Management, disaster recovery, Disaster Reduction, disaster\n            response, disaster risk, disasters, Documents, earthquake,\n            earthquake insurance, earthquakes, emergency management,\n            emergency needs, emergency operations, Fiduciary, Financial\n            Analysis, Financial Institutions, financial instruments,\n            Financial Management, financial risk, flooding, housing,\n            hurricane, hurricanes, Indemnity, INSURANCE, insurance\n            contracts, insurance coverage, insurance markets, insurance\n            policies, insurance pools, insurance premium rates,\n            insurance premiums, insurance products, insured losses,\n            International Financial Institutions, legislation,\n            liquidity, mitigation, natural disaster, natural disasters,\n            natural hazards, non-life insurance, operating expenditures,\n            pensions, programs, public services, rates,\n            recapitalization, Reinsurance, reinsurance capacity,\n            reinsurance contract, reinsurance markets, reinsurers,\n            reserves, risk diversification, Risk Insurance, risk\n            management, Risk Mitigation, risk profiles, Risk Transfer,\n            risk transfer mechanisms, securities, state property, storm,\n            storms, Sustainability, technical assistance, transaction\n            costs, transparency, Trinidad and Tobago"}},"owner":"Urban (LCSUW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"38540"},"7373483":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2007/01/7373483/haiti-catastrophe-insurance-project-appraisal-stage","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2007/01/7373483/haiti-catastrophe-insurance-project-appraisal-stage","new_url":"2007/01/7373483/haiti-catastrophe-insurance-project-appraisal-stage","disclosure_date":"2007-02-06T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/02/06/000020953_20070206134726/Rendered/INDEX/38565.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/02/06/000020953_20070206134726/Rendered/PDF/38565.pdf","docdt":"2007-01-22T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2007-02-06T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"initial appraaisal","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Haiti -
