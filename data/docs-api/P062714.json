Some lessons learned included: improvement of\n            spate irrigation management needs not only hardware\n            interventions (rehabilitation and modernization of\n            infrastructure) but also institutional development and\n            information management measures. The project's\n            Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) and Agriculture\n            Demonstration Program (ADP) components have resulted in very\n            tangible progress towards achieving sustainable and\n            efficient spate irrigation management and increasing\n            agricultural productivity and rural incomes. To further\n            develop and greatly extend these successes, they should be\n            enhanced and replicated in other promising wadis under the\n            recently approved Water Sector Support Project (WSSP).
