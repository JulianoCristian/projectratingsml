Project objectives\n            were to maintain adequate navigation channels in the Zaire\n            estuary and river. Project implementation was partial.\n            Objectives were not reached; despite sizeable procurement of\n            equipment, channels were not maintained; the performance of\n            the executing agencies deteriorated. Its outcome is rated as\n            unsatisfactory, its sustainability as unlikely, and its\n            institutional impact as negligible. Lessons learned\n            included: 1) A public enterprise lacking the autonomy to\n            adjust to the declining economic conditions is not viable\n            under such conditions; and 2) During implementation, it\n            became clear that neither Sea Traffic Authority (RVM) nor\n            River Traffic Authority (RVF) was experienced in dealing\n            with Bank procurement procedures. This could be prevented in\n            the future by training and through appropriate seminars."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Technical Cooperation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Technical\n            Cooperation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/01/733989/china-second-technical-cooperation-project","projn":"CN-Tech.Coop.
