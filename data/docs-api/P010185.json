The project achieved\n            many of its technical objectives, its impact has been\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and\n            Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, the Government, WAPDA, and\n            the Association would have saved a great deal of time and\n            effort, if instead of preparing and implementing a\n            full-fledged project, the Project Preparation Facility had\n            been used to fund the initial exploratory stages before\n            launching the project. Second, in an exploratory project of\n            this type, the Borrower and the Association should be alert\n            to the need for immediate cancellation of subsequent stages\n            of the project should they prove unnecessary. Lastly, the\n            project confirms the wisdom of the staged approach towards\n            expenditures on mineral exploration, which in this case\n            evaluated a large coat basin with minimal expenditures and\n            large savings of credit proceeds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Coal Engineering Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Coal Engineering
