d'Ivoire\n            was satisfactory. The project achieved most of its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            substantial, sustainability is uncertain, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, the\n            effectiveness of a sectoral adjustment program is better\n            warranted whenever policy changes take place sufficiently in\n            advance of loan approval. Second, the association of a SECAL\n            and an ongoing investment loan is a practical alternative to\n            an hybrid loan. Third, the Ivorian experience of\n            privatization of urban water services confirms that the\n            private sector is not interested in purchasing existing\n            water facilities or financing investments from its own\n            resources. Fourth, centralized maintenance of scattered\n            rural facilities is not sustainable, even if it is carried\n            out by a private company. Fifth, the fragmentation of\n            investment-related responsibilities led to an overall lack\n            of accountability. Finally, sectoral investment funds backed\n            by earmarked resources are vulnerable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Sector Adjustment

To this effect, the program comprises the following\n            : 1) a new institutional framework based on Government\n            retrenchment through increased privatization and community\n            management of rural facilities; 2) introduction of efficient\n            pricing of urban water services and of full recovery of\n            maintenance costs in rural areas; 3) establishment of\n            regulations and controls on private extraction of\n            groundwater and on disposal of domestic and industrial\n            wastewater; and 4) implementation of a new financing\n            strategy and restructuring of sector finances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Sector Adjustment Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Sector Adjustment Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/06/737360/cote-divoire-water-supply-sanitation-sector-adjustment-program","projn":"CI-Water Supply Sewerage Sect.Adj -- P001151","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Economic Theory & Research,National Governance,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Public Sector Development","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960929090317"},"subsc":"(Historic)Water supply and sanitation adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Public Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,allocation of\n            resources,authorization,benefits in kind,borrowing,budgetary\n            resources,capital flight,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,community development,community management,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,consumers,cost recovery,cubic\n            meter,Debt,debt service,debt service\n            payments,deregulation,economic activity,economic\n            growth,economic incentives,economic performance,economic\n            problems,economic recovery,electricity,environmental\n            degradation,Environmental Protection,equilibrium,exchange\n            rate,exchange rates,export led growth,exports,financial\n            autonomy,financial control,financial crisis,financial\n            difficulties,financial intermediation,Financial\n            Management,financial policies,financial resources,financial\n            sector,financial system,FISCAL,Fiscal Deficit,fiscal\n            deficits,fiscal revenues,fiscal surplus,foreign\n            borrowing,foreign debt,foreign investors,GDP,GNP,GNP per\n            capita,government agency,Government intervention,Government\n            Spending,households,housing,Human Resources,income,income\n            distribution,inefficiency,inflation,informal\n            economy,informal sector,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Framework,interest rate,investment expenditures,investment\n            program,labor market,liquidity,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,allocation of\n            resources,authorization,benefits in kind,borrowing,budgetary\n            resources,capital flight,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,community development,community management,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,consumers,cost recovery,cubic\n            meter,Debt,debt service,debt service\n            payments,deregulation,economic activity,economic\n            growth,economic incentives,economic performance,economic\n            problems,economic recovery,electricity,environmental\n            degradation,Environmental Protection,equilibrium,exchange\n            rate,exchange rates,export led growth,exports,financial\n            autonomy,financial control,financial crisis,financial\n            difficulties,financial intermediation,Financial\n            Management,financial policies,financial resources,financial\n            sector,financial system,FISCAL,Fiscal Deficit,fiscal\n            deficits,fiscal revenues,fiscal surplus,foreign\n            borrowing,foreign debt,foreign investors,GDP,GNP,GNP per\n            capita,government agency,Government intervention,Government\n            Spending,households,housing,Human Resources,income,income\n            distribution,inefficiency,inflation,informal\n            economy,informal sector,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Framework,interest rate,investment expenditures,investment\n            program,labor market,liquidity,"}},"owner":"WB Office: Abidjan (AFMCI)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"P5089"},"facets":{}}}
