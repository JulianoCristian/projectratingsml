Ratings for the\n            Mainstreaming Adaption to Climate Change Project for Latin\n            America and Caribbean were as follows:  outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory;\n            and borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: the United Nation (UN)\n            framework's three-stage conceptual model for sequencing\n            climate change adaptation efforts is comprehensive, but by\n            compressing so many activities in the first stage of the\n            process, it is too demanding of scarce human capital,\n            particularly in small developing country contexts with\n            limited absorptive capacities. Adapting to climate change is\n            a complex and multi-sectoral challenge requiring an\n            integrated and collaborative approach. However, this does\n            not have to be done all at once or within a single project\n            if doing so makes implementation unmanageable. Getting a few\n            things right is better than trying to do too much and losing\n            project focus in the process, as happened in this series of\n            projects. Building complementary institutional and technical\n            capacities at both the regional and national levels can have\n            synergistic effects unachievable by pursuing tasks at either\n            level alone. There are areas of significant overlap found\n            between disaster risk management and climate change\n            adaptation efforts. It is important that each focus on\n            specific core tasks where they have comparative advantages\n            of expertise and experience, but they also need to find\n            areas where their common objective of reducing\n            climate-related risks in both the short- and long-run can\n            produce mutual benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and Caribbean -

Some lessons learned included: the\n            institutional arrangements need to be simplified for\n            effective project implementation. Separate and several\n            layers of bureaucracy in project implementation should be\n            avoided so as to reduce delays in execution. Such multiple\n            layers appear too bureaucratic and daunting to some\n            stakeholders. It is also not conducive to reducing time lags\n            between decisions and actions. Clear project objectives\n            should be matched by simple project design. While MACC had\n            very clear objectives, its execution was hampered in part by\n            a cumbersome project design. Project design should be\n            carefully assessed so as not to be overly-ambitious for the\n            existing capacity of the recipient and the government\n            counterparts. Projects should avoid complicating execution\n            by having too many activities, especially for regional\n            projects which inherently tend to be complex in nature.\n            Project executing and collaborating agreements with key\n            partner institutions should not be open-ended, rather they\n            should be targeted and ring fenced. Collaboration\n            arrangements should be as clearer as possible in terms of\n            specifying the terms of cooperation, defining the costs, and\n            outputs expected from each partner. Otherwise, other options\n            should be considered, for example, by competitively\n            procuring consultancy services in order to increase\n            efficiencies in terms of time,

Project components\n            will: 1) build regional capacity to collect, and analyze\n            data, thus expand the knowledge base on climate change\n            impacts in order to asses the associated physical, and\n            socioeconomic vulnerabilities; 2) build in-country capacity\n            to formulate, and analyze adaptation policy options, and\n            finalize sectoral adaptation strategies for participating\n            countries, first, for those countries implementing\n            vulnerability, and risk assessment studies, and, second, for\n            non-study countries, but that have derived vulnerability\n            assessments from country-level sectoral studies. The\n            component will identify adaptation measures, develop\n            approaches to food security, water, health, and fishery\n            sectors, incorporating concerns related to environmental\n            impact assessments. Consequently, recommendations will\n            address upgrading infrastructure technical norms, responsive\n            to climate changes, to finally incorporate multi-sectoral\n            adaptation strategies; 3) build capacity in preparation for\n            a regional position for the United Nations Framework\n            Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), that would enhance\n            the region's visibility on relevant policy decisions,\n            providing member countries with a consolidated position in\n            the international forum. In addition, a regional strategy\n            will be developed, which includes the preparation of\n            business plans, and mobilization of resources; and, 4)\n            support public education and outreach programs, by\n            strengthening information access and data resources, and,\n            fostering public awareness, through technical assistance and\n
