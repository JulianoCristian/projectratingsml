PEREL supported the\n            Privatization and restructuring of bulky, inefficient and\n            ineffective public enterprises operating in the\n            telecommunications railways and oil and gas sectors of the\n            Argentine economy. Further, PEREL was aimed at strengthening\n            the Government's administrative and technical\n            capabilities to carry out its Public Enterprise (PE) reform.\n            It provided long-term financing for the provision of\n            consulting services, training and goods. The project\n            objectives as stated in the President's Report were to\n            support: (a) the total or partial privatization of four\n            major PEs in Argentina as well as improvement of the\n            financial viability and service quality of non-privatized\n            business units; (b) the preparation of further privatization\n            programs; and (c) the strengthening of the institutional and\n            regulatory framework for the sectors in which PEs operate.\n            Another objective was to engender competition within the\n            private sector which had thrived financially under the\n            protective shield of government regulations, which had\n            encouraged PE inefficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
