The World Bank Group's overall performance in\n            project preparation, appraisal, and supervision is rated\n            satisfactory. The Borrower's performance in project\n            preparation, implementation, management, and performance\n            monitoring was more than satisfactory. These are the key\n            lessons learned and applicable to future similar projects in\n            China: Compared to large-scale new irrigation areas,\n            investment to improve and expand existing irrigation\n            facilities in smaller areas which are simple in design and\n            compact for rapid implementation costs less; and project\n            benefits could be accrued county by county in a relatively\n            short period. Government commitments in providing timely and\n            adequate resources, effective leadership at all project\n            levels, and the active participation of beneficiaries and\n            stakeholders ensures smooth implementation, success, and\n            sustainability. Keeping the project sub-components to a\n            minimum reduces the complexity of preparation and\n            implementation, thereby maximizing the use of resources.\n            Pre-setting ceilings for investment and average unit prices\n            constrains project planning and design, resulting in a low\n            work quality and difficult operation and maintenance.\n            Participating counties should be selected based on their\n            financial capacity and willingness to contribute funds,\n            recover costs from project beneficiaries, and repay debts.\n            This ensures smooth project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Irrigated Agriculture\n            Intensification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Irrigated Agriculture\n            Intensification Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728756/china-irrigated-agriculture-intensification-project","projn":"CN-Irrig.
