The principal project objectives were: (a) to\n            increase production of cotton, the main cash crop in the\n            area, and cereals grown as rotation crops; (b) to organize\n            farmer groups and help them assume more responsibility for\n            primary marketing, application for credit and credit\n            recovery, and investment decisions; (c) to promote the\n            integration of crop and livestock activities, including\n            consolidation of achievement under the then ongoing\n            Livestock Project; (d) to develop essential rural\n            infrastructure;  and (e) to improve the operational and\n            financial efficiency of Cotton Development Agency. Cotton\n            production fell substantially short of appraisal projections\n            because farmers found groundnut cultivation more\n            remunerative due to the relatively high groundnut producer\n            prices set by the Government and the low return to labor on\n            cotton. The problem worsened with the reduction of cotton\n            input subsidies in 1986. As a result, cotton acreage\n            declined and never reached pre-project levels during\n            Implementation: total seed cotton production declined from\n            46,900 t in 1984 to 29,300 t in 1990 before rebounding\n            however to 44,900 t in 1991.
