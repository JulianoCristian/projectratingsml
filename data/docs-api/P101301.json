Some lessons\n            learned included: the analytical work conducted as part of\n            the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) and in preparation\n            for the first operation provided a thorough examination of\n            environmental priorities and an understanding of the\n            country's institutional framework for environmental\n            management. The actual process of carrying out the analysis\n            was equally as important, as it helped to build consensus\n            among stakeholders on reforms to the National Environmental\n            System (SINA). Inter-institutional coordination is essential\n            for strengthening the reform program. Inter-institutional\n            coordination, in particular National Planning Department\n            (DNP) participation in the DPL Program has been instrumental\n            in enhancing coordination among key SINA actors as well as\n            other line ministries. This coordination among line\n            ministries, as well as vertically between national and\n            regional authorities, has enriched policy development in the\n            areas of air quality, water quality, and environmental\n            health, as well as data collection required for the\n            monitoring of SINA's progress toward goals linked with\n            sustainable
