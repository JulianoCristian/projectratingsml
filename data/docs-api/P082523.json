Some lessons learned included:\n            nothing substitutes a Borrower's commitment to project\n            objectives. This project is a prime example of the fact that\n            nothing substitutes for a Borrower's commitment to\n            project objectives. Technical assistance in the context of\n            development policy lending, including programmatic\n            development policy lending realities and needs. There is a\n            wide array of experience within the Bank with technical\n            assistance loans that accompany development policy loans\n            (DPLs) in support of the development and design of reforms\n            that count on financial support under the associated DPL(s).\n            The Project's design was such that each of three\n            implementing agencies was to be responsible for procurement,\n            disbursement and financial management arrangements and\n            reporting project progress directly to the Bank (i.e.,\n            without an overall coordinating unit). The project provided\n            assistance to the Government within a coherent and\n            coordinated framework of overall support to Brazil's\n            social sectors that included a comprehensive program of\n            lending and non-lending assistance, including short-term,\n            hands-on advisory services. It may sound redundant to say\n            this, but this assistance framework, coupled with the\n            Government's commitment to the overall objectives that\n            it supported (and continues to support) provided an\n            environment conducive to the accomplishment of this (and\n            other) Project's objectives. This is all the more\n            apparent in view of the fact that some of the Project's\n            objectives were met without loan financing but with Bank\n            assistance under other Bank-financed projects or through its\n            extensive program of analytical and advisory services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Human Development Technical\n            Assistance
