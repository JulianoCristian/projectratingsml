Lessons learned include: first, urban\n            transport reform is intrinsically difficult to achieve as\n            demonstrated by this project. It highlights the importance\n            of setting up realistic development objective in accordance\n            with the agreed time frame. Indeed, expecting to carry out\n            these specific reforms in Tunisia over the initially planned\n            time span of five years, whereas key components were not yet\n            designed when the loan was approved, was probably\n            overoptimistic. Nevertheless, it was reasonable to expect\n            achieving them over the eight and plus years that the\n            project eventually lasted. Second, setting up new\n            structures/institutional arrangements for transport at the\n            regional level is complex and sensitive, touching on\n            decentralization issues going well beyond urban transport.\n            If there are lingering doubts within government on the\n            rationale of setting up new structures whereas existing ones\n            may possibly be used, the challenges will be even greater.\n            Third, reforming public (state-owned) transport enterprises\n            is difficult and sensitive, if not more than reforming\n            public enterprises in many other sectors. Particularly so,\n            if their financial situation and hence capacity to invest\n            for future productivity gains depends heavily on tariffs set\n            or approved by the Government and contributions from the\n            State when they have significant public service obligations.\n            Having a fair assessment of their performance is paramount\n            for the dialogue with the Government on reforming and\n            supporting those enterprises. Benchmarking their performance\n            regularly with strong performers of other countries should\n            be carried out regularly. Fourth, the contractual\n            arrangements between a transport enterprise and its large\n            captive client could turn into difficult issues, even more\n            so when the client is a major exporter like the phosphate\n            mining company selling in a highly competitive world markets\n            and the transporter is the state-owned railway company.\n            Finally, the advanced availability of design studies and the\n            harmonization of clear procurement procedures from the\n            outset of project implementation are critical for a timely\n            implementation of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Transport Sector Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Second Transport Sector\n            Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/04/12502725/tunisia-second-transport-sector-investment-project","projn":"TN-Transport Sector Project II -- P064082","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Transport,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100702015737"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Railways,General transportation sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Adjustment Lending,air\n            quality,autonomy,bottlenecks,bridge,bus,bus companies,bus\n            lines,bus operations,bus operators,bus services,bus\n            transport,buses,car use,cars,civil service,comprehensive\n            parking policy,concessions,Cost Benefit Analysis,current\n            costs,drivers,driving,economic efficiency,economic\n            growth,Employment,erosion,fares,Financial\n            Management,Financial Management Systems,financial\n            performance,financial restructuring,FISCAL YEAR,free\n            transport,Gross Domestic Product,income,institutional\n            development,Interurban Transport,Key performance\n            indicators,large cities,legislation,Light Rail,light rail\n            system,Light Rail Transit,local government,local\n            governments,Local taxation,local taxes,Management\n            Reports,maturity,mobility,motorization rate,motorized\n            transport,municipal\n            governments,municipalities,Navigation,Net Present\n            Value,operating costs,overpasses,parking,parking\n            areas,parking fees,particulate\n            emissions,paving,police,Present Value,private\n            participation,private sector,private sector\n            investment,private sector\n            participation,privatization,productivity,profitability,public\n            enterprises,public finance,public investment,public\n            investments,public procurement,public sector,public sector\n            management,Public Service,Public Transport,Public transport\n            share,public transport system,public transport users,public\n            transportation,Radio,rail transport,railways,Rate of\n            Return,regulatory framework,road capacity,Road safety,Road\n            widening,roads,Safeguard Policies,safety\n            standards,savings,sidewalks,speed,taxation,taxis,Technical\n            Assistance,Traffic,traffic congestion,Traffic\n            Control,Transport,transport infrastructure,Transport\n            investment,transport planning,Transport Sector,transport\n            subsidies,trips,trips per day,trucking,tunnels,urban\n            development,urban passenger,urban passenger transport,urban\n            public transport,urban transport,urban transport\n            reform,urban transport sector,urban transport\n            services,vehiclesInstitutional capacity;

operations of the\n            light rail system in Tunis, and finance severance payments;\n            2) support institutional capacity building at decentralized\n            level in management and

The project implements\n            measures to reform and improve the urban transport sector\n            along guidelines set forth by the Government; and modernizes\n            rail services to support the phosphate industry. The three\n            project components: 1) invest in improving public bus\n            services through enhanced maintenance of the fleet and\n            traffic management practices, streamline operations of the\n            light rail system in Tunis, and finance severance payments;\n            2) support institutional capacity building at decentralized\n            level in management and
