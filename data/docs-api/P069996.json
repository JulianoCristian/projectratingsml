Some lessons\n            learned included: a clear lesson emerging from phase one of\n            the ERT is the need to undertake a careful assessment of the\n            potential for private sector investment in rural energy/\n            renewable energy, including identifying barriers, needed\n            incentives, and/or risk mitigation measures to enhance this\n            potential. Participation of the private sector in phase one\n            in renewable energy power generation for sale to the grid\n            was satisfactory but was poor in access projects via\n            main-grid extension, the project's largest investment\n            component. Project design needs to take into account\n            existing capacities of all ministries and public agencies\n            involved in implementation, including at the community\n            level; training and capacity building also need to be\n            provided to operate and maintain projects. Having a\n            field-based member in the Bank's supervision team,\n            speaking the local language with a detailed knowledge of the\n            country's rural areas, is effective and helpful in\n            project implementation, especially for dealing with issues\n            on a real-time basis. It is also helpful in ensuring that\n            the Bank team has a close relationship with the many\n            stakeholders in a project of this kind. The complex\n            procurement packages required seasoned Bank project\n            procurement staff to be in place during project preparation\n            rather than later in the project implementation period.\n            Currently, there is limited supply of long-term development\n            finance (on terms beyond five years), due to the mismatch\n            between the requirements of long-term lending, and the time\n            profile of commercial banks liabilities. This constraint\n            needs to be rectified. Uganda also needs to develop further\n            strategies to attract more foreign investment for rural energy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Energy for Rural Transformation

is already at the site from\n            60kW to 250kW in order to meet growing demand at the\n            hospital and to sell excess electricity to the nearby\n            community and trading center. The upgrading also aims to\n            providing a reliable source of electricity in a sustainable\n            and environmentally acceptable manner. There is no\n            resettlement in the project area. No settlements or\n            buildings are located in the direct impact zone. However,\n            since some agricultural land will be inundated, relocation\n            of households depend on this land (owned by the hospital but\n            used by staff for gardens) may chose to move closer to their\n            new fields. Further clarification of this issue is necessary\n            but it is not expected that more than a few households may\n            choose to relocate. However, for distribution of power to\n            neighboring communities there is likelihood of temporary\n            displacement/land take to make way for powerlines. Part of\n            the skilled workforce will be imported as not all required\n            labor can be met in the project area. Dam construction\n            enlarging the canals and other activities will result in\n            some minor changes in topography and other landscape\n            characteristics. The generation of a reliable supply of\n            electricity in Kisiizi will have enormous positive benefits\n            for the region.

- Energy for Rural Transformation\n            Project : environmental impact assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Energy for Rural Transformation\n            Project will promote the use of stand-alone solar\n            photovoltaic (PV) systems and the generation of conventional\n            power from small renewable energy resources. The project\n            will avoid sensitive and high biodiversity sites, such as\n            National Parks. Avoidance of these areas concerns also the\n            anticipated population influx and human development that may\n            remain after project completion. Changes in water flow and\n            water quality are likely to occur when constructing a\n            hydropower project. It is necessary to measure the existing\n            flows in terms of velocity of the proposed affected stretch\n            of the river. Another consideration is the generation\n            capacity and needs which in turn affect river flows. Water\n            quality affects sedimentation and erosion, various forms of\n            pollution, and changing flora. Sediment loads may increase\n            during construction of hydropower projects, though may\n            decrease during operation due to a reduction flow in\n            reservoirs. Measuring sediment loads during the project may\n            be required. Pollution in the form of fuel, oil, lubricants,\n            and other chemicals need to be controlled and carefully\n            monitored. To mitigate impacts on vegetation, revegetation\n            programs and reforestation programs may be undertaken and\n            should be funded by the project developer after\n            construction. A baseline study of wildlife will be\n            undertaken if the project disturbs fauna."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Construction of Arua-Nebbi 33k power line:\n            table of affected persons and extent of effect on plants and land"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Energy for Rural\n            Transformation Project : environmental impact assessment\n            (Vol. 4) : Construction of Arua-Nebbi 33k power line: table\n            of affected persons and extent of effect on plants and land"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/01/4104056/uganda-energy-rural-transformation-project-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-4-construction-arua-nebbi-33k-power-line-table-affected-persons-extent-effect-plants-land","projn":"UG-Energy For Rural Transform (Fy02) -- P069996,UG-Gef Energy For Rural Transf (Fy02) -- P070222,UG-West Nile Electrification -- P072090","subtopic":"Sustainable Land Management,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Drylands & Desertification,Food & Beverage Industry,Agricultural Research","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Uganda","authors":{"authr":"Norplan Ltd.;

The upgrading also aims to\n            providing a reliable source of electricity in a sustainable\n            and environmentally acceptable manner. There is no\n            resettlement in the project area. No settlements or\n            buildings are located in the direct impact zone. However,\n            since some agricultural land will be inundated, relocation\n            of households depend on this land (owned by the hospital but\n            used by staff for gardens) may chose to move closer to their\n            new fields. Further clarification of this issue is necessary\n            but it is not expected that more than a few households may\n            choose to relocate. However, for distribution of power to\n            neighboring communities there is likelihood of temporary\n            displacement/land take to make way for powerlines. Part of\n            the skilled workforce will be imported as not all required\n            labor can be met in the project area.
