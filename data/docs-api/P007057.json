The project components include: (i) credit and\n            other agricultural support services; (ii) the rehabilitation\n            and expansion of irrigation works; (iii) construction and\n            improvement of rural roads; (iv) rural electrification; and\n            (v) other social services, e.g., provision of potable water\n            and health services. The only special risk which this\n            project faces would be the occurrence of organizational and\n            management problems owing to Ecuador's little\n            experience, to date, with integrated rural development\n            projects of this type."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Proyecto de Desarrollo Rural de Tungurahua"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador: Proyecto de Desarrollo\n            Rural Tungurahua : Ecuador - Proyecto de Desarrollo Rural de Tungurahua"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/11/11792532/ecuador-tungurahua-rural-development-project-ecuador-proyecto-de-desarrollo-rural-de-tungurahua","projn":"EC-Rural Devt I-Tung -- P007057","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Environment","count":"Ecuador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100215225202"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Community facilities; Construction; Health\n            services; Improvement; Irrigation systems; Potable water;\n            Roads & highways; Rural electrification; Silviculture,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Community facilities; Construction; Health\n            services; Improvement; Irrigation systems; Potable water;\n            Roads & highways; Rural electrification; Silviculture,,"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"2154","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Proyecto de Desarrollo Rural\n            de Tungurahua"}}},"facets":{}}}
