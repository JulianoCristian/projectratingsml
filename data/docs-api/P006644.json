Some lessons learned included:\n            availability of sufficient financial resources for\n            satisfactory implementation of a project can be ensured\n            through favorable macroeconomic conditions, sound\n            macroeconomic policies and adequate sectoral allocation of\n            budget resources. Satisfactory project implementation is\n            fundamentally determined by adequate project design, which\n            should be kept as simple as possible within the complexities\n            of the sector and of the project objectives.
