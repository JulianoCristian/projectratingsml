However, the Borrower's performance is\n            unsatisfactory, given the detrimental effects of governance\n            issues, and deep shortfall of counterpart funding. Lessons\n            indicate that implementation of basic services projects,\n            within a general climate of lack of support from government,\n            and overall deterioration in the country, will only result\n            in minimal gains. Thus, access to, and quality of education\n            did not improve during implementation, rather the project\n            only laid the foundation for improvements. In an overall\n            environment of strong centralization, poor governance, and\n            loss of trust in Government, the most successful\n            interventions were those with substantial involvement from\n            communities. Similarly, the use of alternative institutions\n            - parastatals - for service delivery, may be the most\n            effective way to achieve results in an environment as\n            previously described, but it is difficult to reverse once in\n            place, for in the long run, regular line agencies become\n            substantially weakened, and require further restructuring,\n            and strengthening. Unfortunately, the improved project\n            performance during the last three years, did not reverse the\n            initial decline, and, extension of the closing date only\n            prolonged an unsatisfactory performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Primary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Primary Education
