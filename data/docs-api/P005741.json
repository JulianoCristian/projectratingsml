Policy reforms and institutional\n            changes are protracted processes calling for continued\n            strong political leadership. 2) Greater university autonomy\n            is integral to improving the relevance and quality of higher\n            education. 3) Participation of beneficiaries and\n            stakeholders in monitoring will strengthen accountability\n            mechanisms and project performance. 4) Better assessment of\n            the Borrower's implementation capacity can prevent\n            implementation delays and improve project design. 5) Strong\n            coordination and project oversight ensures good\n            communication and problem solving."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -
