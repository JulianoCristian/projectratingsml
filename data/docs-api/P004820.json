Key lessons learned include: a) Direct\n            public sector involvement in land development and housing\n            finance is problematic, even when efforts are made to\n            mitigate the risks involved in that kind of intervention. b)\n            Insufficient attention to local socio-cultural factors and\n            lack of adequate client consultation can seriously impede\n            sensitive project design; prior social assessment is\n            essential for a low-income housing project. c) Key actions\n            deemed necessary for project success must be insisted upon\n            early on. d) If there is an unusually long delay between\n            project appraisal and effectiveness, the project objectives\n            and scope need to be reviewed for their
