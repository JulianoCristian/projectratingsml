Some lessons learned included: the\n            project has served as the central arena for discussion and\n            formulation of a draft policy on culture management in\n            Eritrea. The Steering Committee brought together the key\n            players in different aspects of culture services (museums,\n            archives, oral history, archaeology, building and urban\n            conservation), who previously had worked in isolation under\n            different institutional set-ups. The project clearly\n            demonstrated that culture cannot continue to be managed by\n            different bodies under different institutional set-ups. It\n            proved the value and effectiveness of a common umbrella\n            housing the different bodies working on culture. The project\n            demonstrated the need for the project team and Bank\n            management to be flexible and sensitive to bottlenecks and\n            problems, especially when working in a new sector and in an\n            unstable post-conflict situation. The project has ensured\n            that long-term links are established with international\n            funding and technical resource institutions. The project has\n            built strong links between culture and education, and\n            demonstrated the importance of culture to national identity\n            and integration. This is seen in a range of activities:\n            school tours and public lectures during the Metera stelae\n            restoration, competition for school children focusing on\n            urban architecture and environmental awareness, publication\n            and distribution of school materials, and research books on\n            architecture, oral history, and oral traditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea - Cultural Assets Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Eritrea - Cultural Assets\n            Rehabilitation

It will support enterprise\n            development; improve the delivery of community and public\n            services; and support training and capacity building. 3) The\n            support living
