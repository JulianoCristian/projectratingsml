The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Attention should be given up front to the institutional and\n            financial arrangements for operation & maintenance\n            (O&M) of the new facilities. 2) The entity responsible\n            for overall project coordination involving various agencies\n            should be fully staffed prior to implementation and be\n            empowered to approve key project milestones and impose\n            penalties for non-adherence to these milestones. 3) The\n            community participation arrangements should be clearly\n            defined prior to appraisal. 4) Planning of water supply and\n            sanitation facilities should have a long-term horizon and\n            investments should be planned to allow for infrastructure to\n            be built in a phased manner. 5) The respective roles of\n            government agencies, communities, nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs), and local governments in the planning,\n            implementation, and O&M of water and sanitation\n            facilities should be clearly defined during project\n            preparation. 6) Criteria for the selection of NGOs should be\n            clear, well targeted and transparent, and agreed by project\n            appraisal. 7) Adequate orientation and capacity building for\n            the staff of the public sector agencies and NGOs involved\n            should be made available as early as possible during\n            implementation. 8) To ensure affordability of the piped\n            regional water schemes, lower-cost alternatives should be\n            pursued and users' willingness to pay should be\n            assessed at an early stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Maharashtra

The rural water\n            supply component will include about 75 large regional piped\n            water supply schemes, 170 individual village piped water\n            schemes and the installation of about 3,000 hand pumps.  In\n            a country where the incidence of water-related diseases is\n            high and public sanitation standards poor, the project will\n            promote enhanced approaches to environmental sanitation and\n            health communications through the development of new\n            strategies and the implementation of those strategies\n            through innovative programs.  The environmental sanitation\n            component will promote the disposal of waste water in\n            villages with piped water supply through improved drainage\n            and the construction of low cost latrines.  The health\n            communications component will create greater community\n            awareness and demand for improved hygiene and environmental\n            sanitation and will give field staff in the Department of\n            Public Health a greater role in promoting a cleaner\n            environment.  NGOs will play a key role in the planning and\n            implementation of the environmental sanitation and health\n            communications components.

The rural water\n            supply component will include about 75 large regional piped\n            water supply schemes, 170 individual village piped water\n            schemes and the installation of about 3,000 hand pumps.  In\n            a country where the incidence of water-related diseases is\n            high and public sanitation standards poor, the project will\n            promote enhanced approaches to environmental sanitation and\n            health communications through the development of new\n            strategies and the implementation of those strategies\n            through innovative programs.  The environmental sanitation\n            component will promote the disposal of waste water in\n            villages with piped water supply through improved drainage\n            and the construction of low cost latrines.  The health\n            communications component will create greater community\n            awareness and demand for improved hygiene and environmental\n            sanitation and will give field staff in the Department of\n            Public Health a greater role in promoting a cleaner\n            environment.
