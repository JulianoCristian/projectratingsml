The programmatic series, as envisaged in the\n            Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) as updated by the Country\n            Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR), is planned to\n            amount to at least US$200 million. These three loans are\n            expected to be executed sequentially during 2009-2011, and\n            there is an envelope of US$100 million equivalent for the\n            first operation. The PE DPL series, which is aimed at\n            reducing the size of Serbia's large public sector, is\n            complemented by a private and financial sector DPL series,\n            aimed at facilitating the growth of the private sector,\n            through enhancing the business enabling environment,\n            strengthening financial discipline and building a more\n            efficient and stable financial sector. The operation has\n            been conceived within the context of the Country Partnership\n            Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) to accommodate the need for\n            additional budgetary and liquidity support occasioned by the\n            global economic crisis. The total lending envelope for\n            Serbia has been increased by US$300 million beyond the\n            original CPS allocation. This additional lending is to be\n            allocated to development policy lending which will help meet\n            Serbia's medium term financing needs. The operation\n            will be part of a coordinated financing package with the\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European\n            Commission (EC)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia - Programmatic Public Expenditure\n            Development Policy Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia - Programmatic Public\n
