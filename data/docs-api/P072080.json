Some\n            lessons learned included: public sector reform operations\n            need to consider sustainability of commitment from the\n            country's leadership. In the case of Mozambique part of\n            the program was well designed to focus on quick wins that\n            will visibly generate public support, help sustain\n            commitment, and help motivate service providers. However,\n            the legal reform element was overly complex and lacked\n            adequate technical assistance to keep it on track. In\n            contexts where there is joint donor support, the Bank should\n            aim to also provide its support through fund. Electing to\n            opt out of joining a common fund can create an additional\n            burden for the implementing unit and stretch already thin\n            capacity and resources further, in addition to creating the\n            confusion that running disparate system invariably causes.\n            Monitoring and evaluation (M and E) needs to be owned by\n            project managers to support real-time adjustment to projects\n            through the use of feedback mechanisms, and to ensure that\n            results are broadly understood, and used to widen support\n            for reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -

Services will be provided by the\n            citizen's own local governments, via partnerships\n            between the public and private sector, the private sector\n            and executive agencies, all accountable to citizens. It will\n            be a citizen's right rather than a privilege to have\n            access to public services.

Improved delivery of social\n            and economic services will help citizens reach their full\n            productive potential. The project components are: 1) begin a\n            process of restructuring central government; 2)\n            professionalization by motivating public servants to become\n            more responsive to the needs of citizens; 3) governance by\n            improving allocation, efficient use and accountability of\n            public resources; and 4) program coordination by enhancing\n
