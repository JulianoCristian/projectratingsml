Some lessons learned included:\n            designed appropriately, projects provided a very good\n            platform for sound dialogue between international technical\n            assistance, national expert panels, and local institutions\n            which also enhances local capacity and ownership of\n            outcomes. A well-prepared Program Implementation Plan (PIP)\n            improves understanding of program objectives, activities,\n            and ownership. It also smoothes program implementation and\n            helps clarify implementation responsibilities when many\n            agencies are involved. Program training can contribute to\n            capacity building and institutionalization of management\n            systems when conducted systematically over the life of the\n            program. Ensuring active involvement of responsible\n            government department and officials in operational studies\n            succeeded in translating findings and recommendations from\n            operational research into policies. The joint donor\n            financing arrangements resulted in improved coordination\n            which assisted in ensuring good outcomes.

The RWS\n            program consisted of four successive projects (Rural Water\n            Supply Project, National Rural Supply Project, National\n            Water Supply and Sanitation Project, and Forth Rural Water\n            and Sanitation Project) that lasted over the last 17 years.\n            The total World Bank investment in these four projects was\n            US$628 million. The program succeeded at serving about 25\n            million people in 18 provinces and developed a very\n            effective cost recovery policy where the users finance up to\n            75 percent of the capital investment as well as the full\n            operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. With the World\n            Bank assistance, the RWS programs were designed to increase\n            rural access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation.\n            The first project was not specifically targeted at the poor\n            or based completely in rural areas, but both these policies\n            changed in succeeding projects. Within the selected\n            counties, denser areas were chosen to make the cost of\n            supplying piped water economically viable, and within the\n            selected villages, the network aimed to cover all economic\n            sections of the community. For the more remote and less\n            densely populated areas of the project provinces, the\n            approach was to provide hand pumps, rainwater collection\n            systems and small tube wells."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Willingness to charge and willingness to pay\n            : China Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Willingness to charge and\n            willingness to pay : China Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/9976970/willingness-charge-willingness-pay-china-rural-water-supply-sanitation-program","projn":"CN-Fourth Rural Water Supply Project -- P057352,CN-Rural Water S.

Component 3 supports disease\n            prevention and control, with a focus on SARS and other\n            infectious diseases including strengthening disease\n            surveillance and case reporting. The eight operations\n            comprise: the Environmental Technical Assistance Project\n            (report no.

The core\n            components are three: (1) Water supply -providing safe water\n            to poor communities currently lacking such supplies, by\n            maximizing community participation in selecting service\n            alternatives, and supporting water system operator and\n            accounting training to keep costs low and ensure project\n            sustainability; (2) Sanitation and health education,\n            involving working with primary school teachers, village\n            doctors, Women's Federation representatives, and public\n            health systems in their efforts to improve water use and\n            sanitation practices in the villages by supporting\n            demonstration programs to increase use of composting\n            latrines, preparing health education messages aimed at\n            expanding adopting improved sanitation and hygiene\n            practices, primarily among housewives, school-aged children,\n            and household decisionmakers, and training health education\n            specialists; and (3) Project management, supporting\n            increased project office capacity to service villages,\n            including surveys and research, and training in procurement,\n            water supply technologies, water quality protection, and\n            health message delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
