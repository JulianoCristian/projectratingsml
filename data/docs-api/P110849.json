Some lessons\n            learned included: the Government of Mexico (GoM) was, and\n            continues to be, fully committed to its climate change\n            adaptation and mitigation agenda. This DPL supports\n            Mexico's program, and the country is increasingly\n            recognized as an international leader in this area.\n            Ownership at different levels of government has proven to be\n            a driving force for success. An integrated country strategy,\n            in which climate change programs and policies are addressed\n            throughout with a full range of instruments, creates a\n            virtuous framework for addressing the challenges. Granted,\n            not all clients can support the number and diversity of\n            operations and instruments that have been focused on climate\n            change as that of the Mexico program. But it is the\n            consistency with which the issue reappears in the Mexico\n            partnership program (driven in large part as a reflection of\n            the client's commitment), with a diversity of\n            investment and policy operations not only cross-sectoral\n            (such as this DPL) but sectoral as well, that has led to a\n            highly focused and effective engagement. There are more\n            unknowns than knowns in the policy and science of climate\n            change, so technical assistance and a knowledge intensive\n            engagement are especially

          Loan (DPL) Project will support a government of Mexico\n            efforts to mainstream climate change considerations into\n            public policy. The operation consists of policy reforms in\n            three areas: (i) improved analytical basis for policy\n            responses through the submission of a third national\n            communication to the United Nations (UN) framework\n            convention on climate change; (ii) the approval of the\n            national climate change strategy by the government's\n            intersecretarial commission on climate change and its\n            announcement by the President; and (iii) the integration of\n            climate change considerations in sector programs. This\n            operation builds on the Bank's engagement in the energy\n            and natural resources sectors in Mexico, and on the climate\n            change activities already supported by the Bank in Mexico.\n            The Bank's engagement with Mexico on climate change\n            issues dates back to the mid-1990s. This engagement now\n            comprises 26 active initiatives, financed by International\n            Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) loans, Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) grants, carbon finance emission\n            reductions purchase agreements, grants for capacity building\n            in the carbon finance area, and grants for economic sector\n            work and knowledge products. These initiatives are the\n            result of a long-standing dialogue with a wide range of\n            Mexican stakeholders and center on the following main\n            objectives: (a) support for adaptation; (b) policy\n            development and institution building; (c) first-of-a-kind\n            mitigation projects and programs; and (d) identification and\n            promotion of short-term and long-term mitigation options."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Climate Change Development Policy\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Climate Change\n
