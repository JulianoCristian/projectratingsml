Some lessons\n            learned included: the type of intervention chosen and its\n            design in special situations, such as when reopening a\n            Bank/borrower relationship, should be simple and not too\n            demanding on the borrower and its agencies. When major\n            changes in project activities are required, a prompt formal\n            restructuring of the project is preferable to later changes\n            which may come too late to affect outcome. Scope and scale\n            of a project should be well within the implementation\n            capacity of key agencies, especially when prior Bank\n            experience with the implementing agencies is lacking. Where\n            the flow of funds and project activities involve a number of\n            entities, project organization and the channeling of funds\n            must reflect command structures rather than expect peer\n            coordination on a collegial basis to be a sufficient\n            mechanism for efficient implementation. Resorting to the\n            highest level of the Government may be necessary when a\n            combination of constraining factors is outside the\n            competence and reach of implementing agencies alone. Once it\n            is clear that project's activities are lagging, more\n            frequent and stronger supervision missions, with adequate\n            managerial support, should be
