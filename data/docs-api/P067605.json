The lessons learned included: A) The attention\n            of decision makers should be focused on preventive\n            activities to reduce the vulnerability of urban areas to\n            natural disasters; B) Urban development plans should include\n            appropriate measures for preventing severe damages due to\n            natural disasters, including earthquakes and floods; C)\n            Annual budgets of agencies in charge of risk prevention and\n            management should include adequate and well identified\n            amounts for natural disaster prevention; D) Using the case\n            studies of the Ain Temouchent and the Urban Natural Hazard\n            Vulnerability projects, the Government should sensitize\n            local authorities and

case following the November 2001 floods; and F) In view\n            of the frequency of natural disasters in Algeria, the CAS\n            should have included an operation aimed at reducing the\n

The project's long term impact is\n            considered to be essentially positive and will lead to a\n            significantly lower vulnerability in the area. The\n            environmental impacts of the works involved by the Project\n            will be minimal and will be addressed in detail in the\n            integrated vulnerability reduction study. The resettlement\n            of 5,000 families currently living in areas vulnerable to\n            natural hazards is the most serious issue and was analyzed\n            very carefully. The new sites for resettlement of the 5,000\n            families will be subjected to environmental screening and\n            environmental management plans will be prepared as needed to\n            ensure that appropriate mitigation measures will be\n            implemented and monitored. The project also aims at\n            removing, offsetting, or mitigating all impacts of\n            unregulated urban development that magnified the adverse\n            consequences of the flash floods of November 10, 2001. This\n            will be done through works to be carried out on the\n            concerned watersheds and embankments, and will include slope\n            stabilization by tree plantations, retention basins, and\n            drainage collectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental management framework :\n            executive summary"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria -

The project's long term impact is\n            considered to be essentially positive and will lead to a\n            significantly lower vulnerability in the area. The\n            environmental impacts of the works involved by the Project\n            will be minimal and will be addressed in detail in the\n            integrated vulnerability reduction study. The resettlement\n            of 5,000 families currently living in areas vulnerable to\n            natural hazards is the most serious issue and was analyzed\n            very carefully. The new sites for resettlement of the 5,000\n            families will be subjected to environmental screening and\n            environmental management plans will be prepared as needed to\n            ensure that appropriate mitigation measures will be\n            implemented and monitored.
