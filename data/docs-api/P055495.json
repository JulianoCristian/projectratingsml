Among the lesson learned are the following:\n            (1) Community-based child welfare services really work: The\n            sub-projects supported under the CWR project made a very\n            substantial impact on the thinking of what is feasible,\n            which once having been proven to work, have formed the basis\n            for subsequent scaling-up by both the EU and\n            Government's own resources.  (2) Child welfare services\n            require addressing the entire needs of the family and form\n            the basis in Romania for the development of modern social\n            services:  Prevention services and reintegration services\n            need to deal with the entire issues of the family, and not\n            just the specific issues of the particular child concerned\n            if they are to be effective.  (3) A Learning and Innovation\n            Loan (LIL) can be a very effective instrument.  (4) The Bank\n            can provide real value-added in an area such as CWR: The\n            Romania CWR project was the first Bank intervention in the\n            field of CWR in ECA.  (5 )The Bank can leverage/broker\n            impact with a variety of donor parties.  (6) Lending buys a\n            seat at the table for policy dialogue: The Bank was able to\n            be continuously involved in issues of CWR in the High-level\n            Policy Group, the CWR Executive Committee and make\n            worthwhile contributions to the CWR over the life of the\n            project.  (7) High profile political focus can magnify\n            action.  (8) Competitive grant-making approach provides\n            incentives for the local level to implement national policy.\n            (9) It is easier to complete civil works than to change mind-sets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -  Child Welfare Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania -  Child Welfare Reform

Bucharest more fully into society. There are 3\n            components. The Community-Based Child Welfare Services\n            component identifies, finances, monitors, and evaluates\n            sub-projects over a period of 42 months, with the goal of\n            preventing child abandonment and institutionalization, and\n            de-institutionalizing and improving the quality of\n            residential care by alternative community-based services. It\n            provides family counseling and support, educates young\n            parents, provides temporary shelter for young single mothers\n            and their babies, provides day care for children at risk as\n            well as therapeutic care for children with special needs,\n            sets up small group homes that are community-integrated\n            alternative residential care facilities providing\n            short/medium term care, and aids foster care training\n            services. The second component expands an existing center\n            for coordination and information on street children,\n            provides services for them and reduces their number,\n            focusing on night and day shelters, counseling and legal\n            advice, learning and educational facilities, and medical\n            assistance. The third component, supports the Department for\n            Child Protection (DCP) in overseeing project implementation,\n            trains staff, and spreads public awareness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Child Welfare Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Child Welfare Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/693478/romania-child-welfare-reform-project","projn":"RO-Child Welfare Reform -- P055495","subtopic":"Street Children,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Children and Youth,Early Child and Children's Health,Youth and Governance","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Romania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980709144338"},"subsc":"Other social services,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-2","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Account,adaptation,alcoholism,alternative\n            care,audits,basic needs,care centers,care givers,care\n            options,care solutions,Child Protection,child protection\n            system,child rights,Child Welfare,Child Welfare Reform,child\n            welfare services,child welfare system,children in\n            institutions,civil society,conditions for children,day\n            care,delinquency,disabilities,disabled children,domestic\n            violence,employment,families,family care,family\n            support,foster care,foster homes,Health Sector Reform,Health\n            Services,infants,INNOVATION,institutional\n            arrangements,institutional\n            care,institutionalization,institutionalized child\n            care,institutionalized\n            children,Intervention,laws,legislation,living\n            conditions,Management Information System,managers,monitoring\n            progress,parents,partnership,physical growth,primary health\n            care,protecting children,Protection of Children,Public\n            Administration,public awareness,redundancy,Residential\n            care,residential facilities,residential\n            institutions,safety,safety nets,schools,single\n            mothers,single parents,small group homes,social\n            assistance,Social Policy,Social Protection,social\n            services,social workers,special needs,state\n            institutions,street children,technical advice,Technical\n            Assistance,very young children,vulnerable groups,young adults"},"1":{"cdata!":"Account,adaptation,alcoholism,alternative\n            care,audits,basic needs,care centers,care givers,care\n            options,care solutions,Child Protection,child protection\n            system,child rights,Child Welfare,Child Welfare Reform,child\n            welfare services,child welfare system,children in\n            institutions,civil society,conditions for children,day\n            care,delinquency,disabilities,disabled children,domestic\n            violence,employment,families,family care,family\n            support,foster care,foster homes,Health Sector Reform,Health\n            Services,infants,INNOVATION,institutional\n            arrangements,institutional\n            care,institutionalization,institutionalized child\n            care,institutionalized\n            children,Intervention,laws,legislation,living\n            conditions,Management Information System,managers,monitoring\n            progress,parents,partnership,physical growth,primary health\n            care,protecting children,Protection of Children,Public\n            Administration,public awareness,redundancy,Residential\n            care,residential facilities,residential\n            institutions,safety,safety nets,schools,single\n            mothers,single parents,small group homes,social\n            assistance,Social Policy,Social Protection,social\n            services,social workers,special needs,state\n            institutions,street children,technical advice,Technical\n            Assistance,very young children,vulnerable groups,young adults"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025357-PHRD-CHILD WELFARE PROJECT (BANK-EXECUTED)","repnb":"17465"},"facets":{}}}
