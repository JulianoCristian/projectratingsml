Some lessons\n            learned included: The efficient implementation of the\n            project again demonstrated the value of a well designed\n            project and clear and thorough project planning. The one\n            area which continues to require some attention is in the\n            area of resettlement compensation. The Minister of Railways\n            does not directly administer resettlement; this is done in\n            cooperation with local governments from the provincial level\n            down to the village level. On China railway projects this\n            can lead to a disconnect between the project's\n            resettlement action plan and actual implementation.\n            Reinforcing the control mechanisms is an important lesson to\n            be applied to future China railway projects. The use of an\n            independent environmental compliance monitor was a success\n            and is now being employed for other major projects with\n            potential environmental sensitivity, ensuring that proper\n            attention is paid to environmental safeguards while freeing\n            the supervising engineer to concentrate on technical issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

The construction of these bridges will\n            impact on the surface water quality the impact will come\n            from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction\n            under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of\n            abandoned construction waste or construction material,\n            construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near\n            construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources\n            are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil\n            discharged from production sections such as vehicle section\n            and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The\n            main air pollution in construction phase will be from\n            construction dust. After implementation of the project, the\n            existing diesel engine traction locomotives will be replaced\n            by electric traction locomotive. Domestic waste and train\n            waste generated from each station and section will also\n            increase. A new environment impact, electromagnetic\n            pollution will occur. The local land resources will\n            definitely be impacted due to the large amount of land\n            acquisition and removal. Following are some of the\n            mitigation measures: (i) the railway line will be carefully\n            selected to avoid occupying the sensitive ecosystems; (ii)\n            the earthworks will use the excavated earth as backfill\n            where at all possible and minimize the occupation of\n            farmland, cultivated land, and woodlands; (iii) vertical\n            landscaping shall be carried out on the outer sides of the\n            railway stations; (iv) the operation of high-level noise\n            construction shall be 200 meters far from the residential\n            areas, and the low-level noise equipment shall be adopted.\n            Main construction activities shall be strictly controlled\n            within the daytime. Temporary sound-insulation facilities\n            shall be used to decrease the effect of mechanical noise.\n            Construction vehicles shall be arranged to steer clear of\n            the residential areas whenever possible. At the ZheGanLine\n            same time, such vehicles are forbidden to go through the\n            residential areas at night; and (v) watering shall be\n            carried out for temporary roads that have not been laid that\n            are built for the various railway construction site. It\n            shall be done two times per day (one time in morning and\n            another in afternoon) to ease the pollution of dust\n            emissions.

The construction of these bridges will\n            impact on the surface water quality the impact will come\n            from the oil that may leak into the river; the construction\n            under water will cause silts to be suspended, the loss of\n            abandoned construction waste or construction material,\n            construction clay mortar and domestic wastewater near\n            construction site. In operation period, the sewage sources\n            are mainly locomotive depot, wastewater that contains oil\n            discharged from production sections such as vehicle section\n            and domestic wastewater discharged from each station. The\n            main air pollution in construction phase will be from\n            construction dust.

The project has the following three components:\n            Component 1) The Zhe-Gan line is an integral part of the\n            China Railways 2003-2007 Development Plan that calls for\n            raising the speeds and improving the quality of passenger\n            services on the major railway corridors nationwide. The\n            track is to be upgraded on many short sections totaling\n            about half of the track length. The line will also be\n            electrified throughout. Once it is upgraded, the 200 km/h\n            express trains will be operated by electric multiple units\n            (EMUS), while slower passenger and freight trains will be\n            operated with electric locomotives. Component 2) Ministry of\n            Railways (MOR) also wishes to acquire additional highly\n            mechanized, high-capacity equipment for replacing worn rail\n            and switches, renewing ballast, and other maintenance tasks\n            on heavy-traffic lines. Component 3) MOR will hire\n            consultants to analyze, and make recommendations on various\n            issues for improving business processes. MOR has proposed\n            the following topics: traffic forecasting methods; policy\n            framework for resettlement and environmental protection;\n            planning and equipment standards for electrified network;\n            and management of construction supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
