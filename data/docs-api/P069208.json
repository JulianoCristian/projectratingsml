In view of the planned new major\n            investments, the Government has to implement measures to\n            improve institutional and financial performance in advance\n            of these investments. These measures include plans to\n            facilitate a financially sustainable sector in the medium\n            term highlighting the sector committed investments including\n            the associated financing and implementation plans. The post\n            project closing events, arising out of not having adequate\n            budget provisions to ensure the continuing operations of\n            thermal plants highlight the need

     service. In order to achieve these objectives, the Operation\n            comprises: (a) a set of investments and policy measures\n            designed to reduce the supply-demand gap until the Bujagali\n            hydropower plant comes into service in 2011; (b) financial\n            support for the Government to absorb a part of the high\n            costs of short-term thermal power generation; and (c) policy\n            measures aimed at making the sector financially viable,\n            accelerating rural electrification, and moving towards a\n            sector-wide approach for development. The project portion of\n            the operation comprises two components. Component 1 will\n            provide partial co-financing towards the capacity and energy\n            charges of a 50MW thermal plant to be installed at Mutundwe,\n            Kampala. Component 2 will provide Technical Assistance and\n            Energy Efficiency. Activities under this component will\n            include: (a) Energy Efficiency and Demand Side Management\n            ;(b) Independent Evaluation of the Rural Electrification\n            Program; (c) Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA); (d)\n            Power Sector Medium-term Investment Plan; (e) Lake Victoria\n            Transmission Ring Pre-feasibility and Feasibility Studies;\n
