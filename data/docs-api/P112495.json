     From 2002 to 2006, Turkey undertook wide -ranging financial,\n            economic, and public sector reforms. As a result, growth\n            accelerated and public finances improved, with public debt\n            in 2006 at 48 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down\n            from 78 percent. Poverty rates declined sharply. Yet,\n            sustained progress was threatened by challenges in reforming\n            public finances, and outdated regulations hindered\n            investments. Unemployment remained high, and the labor\n            market was largely unskilled. The sharp  deterioration in\n            the global economy in 2008 added to these challenges. The\n            first Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development\n            Policy Loan (REGE DPL 1) in 2010 streamlined World Bank\n            support to Turkey at a critical time when unemployment was\n            16 percent and GDP had contracted by 4.7 percent. The second\n            Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy\n            Loan (REGE DPL 2) supports ongoing reforms of public\n            finances, commercial law, and civil procedures. Turkey has\n            reached almost universal health insurance coverage, enrolled\n            more children in pre-school, and dramatically increased\n            vocational training. These ongoing reforms are expected to\n            reduce poverty and inequality in Turkey over the long run."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sustaining growth with jobs and better\n            services in

The crisis has placed strains on Turkey's\n            economy and public finances. Manufacturing has been hard\n            hit, with effects on unemployment and economic hardships at\n            the household level. At the same time, fundamental strengths\n            have kept Turkey on course to benefit from the global\n            recovery. The first step to returning to growth is to move\n            from crisis-related fiscal expansion to balance and avoid\n            crowding out the private-sector led recovery. The second\n            step is to reinvigorate the business climate reforms and\n            human-capital investments that are central to Turkey's\n            long-term goals. The operation supports both the\n            Government's crisis response and this transition back\n            to sustainable growth under the new Medium Term Program\n            (MTP). The Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment (REGE)\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) continues support to\n            Turkey's public sector reform agenda under the\n            Programmatic Public Sector Development Policy Loan (PPDPL)\n            series. The REGE-DPL also supports the transition to\n            recovery and job creation through business climate reforms\n            supported under the earlier Competitiveness and Employment\n            Development Policy Loan (CEDPL) series. The REGE-DPL also\n            supports measures taken to maintain employment and household\n            incomes in the face of the global crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Restoring Equitable
