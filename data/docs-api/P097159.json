Irrespective of political economy\n            considerations (that were important in this operation's\n            instrument choice), a broad reform programmatic approach can\n            provide for ongoing dialogue on a number of policy fronts\n            and more flexibility in responding to MICs changing needs\n            and priorities. Broad reform based Development Policy Loans\n            (DPLs) can benefit in terms of supervision cost by taking\n            advantage of the sector's overall dialogue and lending/\n            non lending program.
