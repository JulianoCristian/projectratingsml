Among the lessons cited were:\n            1) Achieving an integrated extension service requires a\n            unique institutional setting particularly in an environment\n            where coordination and communication are ineffective. The\n            split of the Ministry of Agriculture into two ministries\n            made the implementation of this approach impossible. Project\n            implementation proved, in the livestock sector, that the\n            extension service delivery should have relied more on\n            livestock specialists for pastoralist and semi-intensive\n            production systems, and on private veterinarians for animal\n            health. 2) Monitoring and evaluation activity should be put\n            at the forefront of project design and implementation. Two\n            ways to achieve that in this case are to: (a) make every\n            effort to effectively involve all national institutions\n            responsible for data collection and management, or (b)\n            create a Network of Impact Studies integrating the\n            institutions in charge of data collection and management\n            under the auspices of a strong national research\n            institution. 3) For service delivery to be efficient and\n            sustained, a holistic approach should be pursued based on:\n            (a) a more professionalized and decentralized service\n            delivery accountable to farmers; (b) improved market and\n            credit access to create incentives to increase productivity\n            and new technology adoption; (c) promoting small rural\n            agro-industries in which the private sector, particularly\n            professional organizations, have a key role to play; and (d)\n            a sustainable financial mechanism to fund extension and\n            research service delivery. 4) Empowering farmers and\n            communities is a long process whose outcome cannot be\n            achieved overnight. 5) Privatizing service delivery happened\n            to be more complex than anticipated. This requires an\n            enabling environment, a strong political will, a critical\n            mass of private actors and more experienced professional\n            organizations supported by a strong capacity building\n            program to foster public-private partnership."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Second National Agricultural\n            Services Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Second National\n            Agricultural Services Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6067516/burkina-faso-second-national-agricultural-services-development-project","projn":"BF-Second National Agricultural Services\n            Development Project -- P000296","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Burkina Faso","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050715113234"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage,Central government administration,Animal production","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development, Agricultural\n            Extension, agricultural extension services, agricultural\n            growth, agricultural production, agricultural products,\n            Agricultural Research, Agriculture, Animal, Animal Health,\n            animal health services, animal health system, Animal\n            production, Animal Resources, capacity building, cereal\n            production, civic engagement, clinics, collaboration,\n            communication skills, Competitive Bidding, comprehensive\n            development, comprehensive development framework, Cotton,\n            crops, data collection, decision making, development\n            projects, drainage, equipment, Exchange Rate, extension\n            services, families, family farms, farm, Farmer, farmers,\n            farmers organizations, farms, financial management,\n            Fisheries, food production, food security, forestry, gender,\n            health services, herders, herds, holistic approach,\n            illiteracy, integration, intensive production systems,\n            Irrigation, laboratories, Livestock, livestock activities,\n            livestock development, livestock market, livestock\n            productivity, livestock sector, livestock specialists,\n            Maize, managers, manure, media, Millet, National\n            Agricultural Research, National Livestock, natural resource\n            management, natural resources, natural resources management,\n            NGOs, partnership, partnership agreements, pastoral\n            development, pastoral producers, pastoral system, pastoral\n            zones, pastoralists, policy, political will, pork, poultry,\n            poverty reduction, private sector, private veterinarians,\n            professional associations, Professional Organizations,\n            programming, programs, public sector, quarantine,\n            redundancy, research, research programs, rice, Rural\n            Development, rural poverty, Scientific Management,\n            slaughtering, smallholders, social services, Sorghum, SPAAR,\n            Special Program for African Agricultural Research,\n            sustainable agriculture, sustainable development,\n            sustainable production systems, technology adoption,\n            Textiles, vaccination, vaccination coverage, vaccination\n            parks, veterinary, veterinary clinics, veterinary services,\n            Water Resources"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 4 (AFTS4)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020524-FRENCH CONSULTANT TRUST FUND\n            FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA,TF023976-FAC CONSULTANT TRUST FUND (USD A/C),TF024991-FRENCH CTF (FY97 ALLOCATIONS),TF030215-FRANCE CTF-SUB SAHARA AFRICA,TF037287-BURKINA FASO - AG SERVICES II,TF038038-BURKINA FASO - SECOND\n            AGRICULTURAL SERVICES DEV.
