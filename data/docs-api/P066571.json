The\n            ratings for the Universal Basic Education Project (UBEP) of\n            Nigeria are as follows: outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was significant; Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory; and also the performance of the Borrower was\n            rated unsatisfactory. The main lessons from the experience\n            of PEP2 and UBEP are as follows: 1) good performance during\n            implementation cannot make up for fundamental design flaws\n            in a project in which component activities are not well\n            aligned with the project development objectives (PDOs). UBEP\n            suffered from too much complexity and spread limited\n            resources too thinly among the 16 states and numerous\n            federal agencies. The states did not have the capacity to\n            implement such a complex design and spreading the resources\n            too thinly did not allow for reaching the critical mass\n            needed to have a catalytic impact upon the system; 2) lack\n            of readiness for implementation cannot be compensated for by\n            imposing many conditions of effectiveness. In hindsight the\n            UBEP was not really ready to start implementation at the\n            time of Board approval and the introduction of conditions of\n            effectiveness could not make up for this lack of readiness;\n            3) technical assistance (TA) needs to be closely aligned\n            with the project development objectives and institutional\n            capacity gaps, and closely supervised by the Bank and\n            co-financiers to prevent it from drifting away from PDOs.\n            Although the TA was implemented by the Department for\n            International Development (DFID) contractors, the Bank did\n            not exercise close monitoring and evaluation initially. The\n            broadly stated TOR led the TA providers to focus initially\n            on school development and not on the strategic management\n            competencies needed to manage a Bank supported project; and\n            4) effective monitoring and evaluation of learning outcomes\n            require a long lead time to design and develop and thus need\n            to be addressed early in project design along with PDOs. A\n            major shortcoming in the UBEP design was its failure to\n            build upon the measures of learning assessment built into\n            PEP2. Learning assessments, or other measures for monitoring\n            quality of outcomes, can be used to feed back into the\n            improvement of curriculum, teaching and school management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Second Primary Education Project;\n            and Universal Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Second Primary\n

- Second Primary Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Primary Education Project for\n            Nigeria had the following ratings: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned: The project was designed during aftermath of the\n            military government and implemented during a transition time\n            by the democratically elected government. This placed\n            restrictions on what the project could realistically\n            achieve. The sub-projects were scaled-up from 740 Focus\n            Schools (FS), this scale-up helped to build momentum within\n            the community and also led to increased interest by the\n            local communities. The project supported community schools\n            with funds for non-personnel expenditure to be used directly\n            by the head teachers to carryout projects identified by the\n            communities. The self-help approach seemed to be potent in\n            improving retention of pupils as well as parents and\n            community involvement in school activities. Improving\n            quality of instruction in the classroom requires concerted\n            and long term efforts. While having the right political\n            environment is necessary, it is not sufficient to transform\n            the structures, attitudes and values that are at the root of\n            social inequalities and injustices. It is important to have\n            the appropriate capacity building activities before project\n            is declared effective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Second Primary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria -
