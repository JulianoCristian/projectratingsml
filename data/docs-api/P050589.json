The lessons\n            learned indicate that institutional changes were important\n            in this project. Initially, in the FYR of Macedonia, there\n            was a gap in understanding of the concept and content of\n            railway restructuring between the Client and the Bank staff\n            and its consultants. In post command economy countries it is\n            difficult for Government entities to accept and put into use\n            the idea of freedom to manage. A review of major investment\n            decision (the railway IT) during the project led to its\n            elimination and project restructuring.

The main components\n            of the project include: 1) the improvement of the\n            Tetovo-Grupcin road to lower transportation costs; 2) the\n            maintenance of the arterial and regional roads; 3) the\n            design and supervision of the pilot maintenance program; 4)\n            the supply of equipment for the Fund for National and\n            Regional Roads (FNRR); 5) the provision of technical\n            assistance and training for FNRR; the supply of equipment\n            for the Macedonia Railways (MR); and, 6) the provision of\n            technical assistance and training for MR. The project will\n            support the restructuring of MR's organization and\n            improve its financial viability. Likewise, road management\n            improvement will be supported through the provision of\n            information management systems, low-cost maintenance\n            technologies, and planning tools, as well as technical\n            assistance and training to FNRR. Key policies and\n            institutional reforms will be supported through the\n            implementation of an Action Plan aimed at restoring long\n            term viability of MR, and, the formulation of investment and\n            maintenance programs to FNRR."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Transport Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Transport Sector
