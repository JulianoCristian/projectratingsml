Some lessons learned included:\n            in a small island economy, postal services have limited\n            space for growth, and need more support to build a diversity\n            of business streams (such as money transfers and payments)\n            and improved quality of service to regain market shares in\n            the parcels and express segments. Lack of leadership in\n            drawing the appropriate policy framework in a timely manner\n            is a key factor in delays for sector reform. The Ministry of\n            Finance (MoF) took the lead on a few items related to the\n            reform agenda items (particularly, SamoaTel's\n            restructuring and privatization), but the rest of the sector\n            reform agenda lacked momentum; and this inertia slowed\n            project implementation. In addition, there was limited\n            capacity to implement the reforms, and this translated into\n            delayed progress, and into extending the project three times\n            (for a total of 34 months beyond the original closing date).\n            In the future, project designs should assess the strength of\n            leadership, and provide for effective capacity for

There are five project components, including\n            project management: (1) The competition and sector reform\n            component finances technical assistance to assist changes to\n            sector legislation in order to increase competition, in the\n            accession to the WTO, and in the design of a postal policy;\n            engagement of advisors for the award of a digital cellular\n            license; and professional development (training, study\n            visits). (2) The regulatory reform component assists the\n            introduction of effective regulation of the\n            telecommunications sector and strengthens the regulatory\n            capacity of the government ministry (MOPT). The component\n            covering the Corporate Reform of SamoaTel includes\n            assistance to explore options to privatize SamoaTel, and to\n            carry out its privatization. The Postal Reform component\n            will be carried out in two phases. Phase 1 involves\n            technical assistance to the government to elaborate a postal\n            sector strategy, and Phase 2 includes the investment to\n            upgrade SamoaTel's postal capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Samoa -
