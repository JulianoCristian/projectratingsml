Some lessons learned\n            includes: in the case of Sierra Leone the Governance Reform\n            and Growth (GRG) series helped to consolidate and entrench\n            the local councils which were re-established after a 30 year\n            absence. This resulted from a strong shared understanding\n            between Government and many external stakeholders about the\n            importance of re-establishing government presence around the\n            country, and the role that the lack of such a government\n            presence played in the conflict. For a post-conflict country\n            in a fragile, state-building process, the benefits of a\n            programmatic approach to policy operations are likely to\n            outweigh the risks, particularly the opportunity to\n            revaluate progress before each successive operation, if the\n            timing of the approval process of donors for budget support\n            is not well aligned with the government's budgetary\n            process, the program support for poverty reduction risks\n            shortfalls due to uncertainty in funding. Embedding policy\n            reforms in the Government's reform agenda instills\n            greater government ownership of the program, diminishing the\n            risk of delays or shortcomings in achieving objectives. For\n            an operation that involves coordinating actions in several\n            sectors, outside the authority of the main implementing\n            agency, the achievement of targets is more likely if\n            disaggregated into a set of measurable indicators with\n            clearly-defined administrative responsibilities in a given\n            ministry, department or agency. In a country short of\n            management capacity, a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation (M\n            and E) framework is not likely to be sustainable without\n            intensive donor inputs and supervision. Also the requirement\n            for monthly reports to be provided by the Ministry of\n            Finance may have been onerous and excessive, discouraging\n            any reporting."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic Governance\n            Reform and Growth Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic\n            Governance

Growth\n            Credit (GRGC-3) in the amount of SDR6.4 million (US$10\n            million equivalent) to the Republic of Sierra Leone was\n            approved by the Board on November 24, 2009, to support\n            implementation of the country's Second Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2) in the context of a\n            multi-donor budget support framework. This single tranche\n            credit is the third in a programmatic series of three\n            Development Policy Operations (DPOs) undertaken by the World\n            Bank and is consistent with the Joint Country Assistance\n            Strategy. At the time the GRGC-3 was negotiated in late\n            2009, the international financial and economic crisis had\n            already adversely affected Sierra Leone's economic\n            performance, although the full extent of this was unclear.\n            Government had already responded in 2009 through programs to\n            assist the hardest hit. For 2010, government plans call for\n            an economic stimulus program to be effected through\n            increased public expenditures with a primary focus on\n            infrastructure spending, mainly for roads and a bold new\n            social agenda to improve health outcomes and provide a\n            cushion for the most vulnerable. A more complete picture\n            about the effects of the global economic and financial\n            crisis on economic performance in 2008 and 2009 is now\n            available. Reduced export demand and remittances led to a\n            slowdown in domestic growth which in turn has lowered the\n            revenue base. Unexpected spending needs in 2009 resulted in\n            deferred investments and generated costs for the 2010 budget\n            which appears underfinanced by the equivalent of about 1.2\n            percent of gross domestic product (GDP), or about US$27.5\n            million. The authorities are therefore seeking additional\n            financing resources to help close the larger than\n            anticipated gap to protect growth and ensure that priority\n            expenditures under the PRSP-2 are maintained."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Third Governance Reform and\n            Growth Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone -
