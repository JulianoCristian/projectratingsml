Some\n            lessons learned included: while research funds are common in\n            Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\n            (OECD) countries, it is also possible to establish and\n            implement a world-class science research fund in a\n            low-income country. An appropriate cost-sharing agreement is\n            needed at entry to facilitate sustainability. The promotion\n            of a knowledge-based economy requires an integral approach,\n            involving several ministries as well as the private sector.\n            A research fund is a viable mechanism to increase research\n            and create programs for science and technology graduates,\n            but its impact may be enhanced by extending\n            capacity-building and technical assistance to grantees.\n            Requiring data collection for grants may also yield better\n            impact or at a minimum a clearer understanding of what was\n            achieved.

The purpose\n            of this six month extension request is to: (i) finalize the\n            remaining procurement for the highly sophisticated research\n            equipment using international competitive bidding and\n            consumables for the research grantees and; (ii) give\n            researchers and PhD students the opportunity to complete\n            their research activities financed by the round three\n            research grants. The restructuring paper also includes\n            revisions and explanations to ensure uniformity between the\n            PDO indicators being tracked in the Implementation Status\n            Result (ISR) reports and the performance indicators in the\n            Financing Agreement and to better align them with the PDO."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data
