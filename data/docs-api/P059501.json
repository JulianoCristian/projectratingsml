Some lessons learned included: A\n            flexible, open technical assistance (TA) facility of this\n            nature with no upfront links with other Bank operations\n            should not be considered at all. A multi-sector TA project\n            of this kind, with multiple implementing agencies should\n            have a well designed information flow mechanism, with\n            special attention to financial flows and reporting. At least\n            50 percent to 60 percent of the project funds for a project\n            of this nature should be committed (in terms of contracts\n            awarded) before the project goes to the Board. A monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E) framework to assess impact of the\n            overall project as well as the sub-projects should be a part\n            of project design. For a project of this nature such a\n            facility is likely to generate more interest if it is a\n            grant rather than a loan. Terms and conditions of accessing\n            funds should be clearly communicated to all entities. A\n            small part of the credit proceeds should be earmarked to\n            allow for learning across states and implementing agencies.\n            The capacity of the project monitoring unit  (PMU) to\n            execute such complex multi-sector TA should be assessed and\n            addressed upfront."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Technical Assistance for Economic\n            Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Technical Assistance for\n            Economic Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/06/9806527/india-technical-assistance-economic-reform-project","projn":"IN-Technical Assistance For Economic Reform\n            Project -- P059501","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,National Governance,Housing & Human Habitats,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,E-Business","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20080829002715"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Tax policy and administration,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Law reform","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, action plan, audit strategy,\n            Authority, Bank Ratings, beneficiaries, best-practice,\n            bureaucratic delays, business process, capabilities,\n            capacity building, CAS, Central government, Central\n            government administration, certificates, civil service,\n            Commerce, connectivity, coordination mechanisms, corruption,\n            database system, demonstration effects, districts, domains,\n            e-Governance, ECONOMIC REFORM, egovernance, employment,\n            Engineer, Engineers, Enterprise Reform, Enterprise Resource\n            Planning, equipment, Expenditure Management, Financial\n            Analysis, financial flows, financial information, Financial\n            Management, financial management system, financial\n            performance, Financial Rate of Return, Financial\n            Restructuring, flexibility, Front-end, Gender, Good\n            Governance, government agencies, government departments,\n            government employees, government organizations, Government\n            Performance, hardware, Human Resource, Human Resource\n            Management, Human Resource Management System, Human\n            resources, ICR, ID, implementation stage, implementation\n            strategy, implementing agencies, Implementing Agency,\n            information flow, information flows, Information Services,\n            Information Systems, Information Technology, institutional\n            capacity, institutional development, Insurance, IP, lack of\n            ownership, Learning, Management Information Systems,\n            Management Reports, municipal agencies, municipal\n            government, Municipal Management, Municipalities,\n            Performance Indicators, pilot project, pilot projects, PMU,\n            poverty alleviation, Poverty Impacts, private investment,\n            private sector, private sector growth, privatization,\n            procurement, Program Implementation, programs, Project\n            Management, Project Management Unit, Project Monitoring,\n            Public expenditure, public procurement, public sector,\n            RESULTS, Rural Development, savings, service delivery,\n            Social Development, social sector, Social Welfare,\n            Standardization, state government, state power, Supervision,\n            tax collections, Tax policy, Tax Reform, tax system,\n            TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, technical expertise, technical issues,\n            Technology Development, Training Manuals, training\n            workshops, Transmission, transparency, transport, user, villages"}},"owner":"Econ.
