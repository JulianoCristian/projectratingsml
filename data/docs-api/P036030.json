These are the lessons learned: 1)\n            The logistics of working on small islands is very heavy.\n            This was clearly underestimated for Round Island, but also\n            applies to Rodrigues and to a lesser extent to Ile aux\n            Aigrettes. Partnerships are essential to overcome such\n            difficulties. 2) Collaboration with partners, and in\n            particular collaboration between a nongovernmental\n            organizations and poublic entities such as Government\n            Departments, benefit from being clearly spelled out and is\n            best organized through the use of formal memoranda of\n            understanding (MOU). Such an MOU would have been most\n            helpful for example in the case of Rodrigues. 3) There is as\n            much to learn from failure as from success, as illustrated\n            by the learning process as Round Island, where trials and\n            errors have eventually led to a full understanding of how\n            the island can be restored.

 funding is not forthcoming. Specifically, it will: 1)\n            protect critically endangered biodiversity of international\n            importance by restoring degraded small island habitats and\n            propagating and reintroducing endemic species to these\n            habitats; and 2) strengthen capacity for the management and\n            monitoring of biodiversity restoration. The project will\n            consist of four components: 1) a survey for (a) the\n            identification of original habitat/community types for\n            determining species recovery and habitat restoration\n            targets, and (b) the eradication or control of undesired\n            exotic species; 2) investment in required infrastructure for\n            the ex-situ propagation and cultivation of threatened\n            plants; 3) supplies and equipment for propagation,\n            replanting and reseeding of endemic plants, and\n            reintroduction of endemic animals from captive-bred\n            populations; and 4) technical assistance to strengthen the\n            governmental and non-governmental institutions involved.\n            This technical assistance will develop: 1) skills in project\n            planning and administration; 2) horticultural expertise and\n            facilities; 3) expertise in applied conservation biology;\n
