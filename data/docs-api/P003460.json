The objectives of the project were: (a) to improve\n            water supply conditions in the three project cities through\n            physical works and strengthening of institutions,\n            regulations, management financial and pricing policies; (b)\n            to improve traffic and public transport conditions in\n            Shenyang; and (c) to improve measures for water pollution\n            abatement. Overall the project's outcome is deemed\n            satisfactory. Achievement of the project's physical\n            objectives was substantial. The performance of IDA in\n            preparation is rated highly satisfactory and satisfactory in\n            supervision. The performance of the Borrower in project\n            preparation is rated highly satisfactory. For project\n            implementation the Borrower's performance is rated\n            satisfactory. Construction activities were carried out\n            efficiently for the most part. Resettlement was well\n            executed. However, the Borrower's performance in\n            carrying studies and technical assistance is rated\n            deficient. Key lessons learned include: (a) As benefits of\n            institutional development are difficult for borrowers to\n            appreciate, project designs must link institutional\n            developments to appropriate incentives and action plans to\n            ensure the full implementation of the institutional\n            development program early in the project; (b) Contracts of\n            greater than one year must contain price escalation clauses;\n            (c) The ICB contract ceiling of US$3.0 million for civil\n            works contracts in China is too low to attract foreign\n            bidders; (d) Provincial governments require filly\n            experienced staff in both technical and managerial areas and\n            supervision to provide the leadership necessary to carry out\n            large scale investment projects and to effectively assist\n            city project staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Liaoning Urban Infrastructure
