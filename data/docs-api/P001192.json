The project only partially achieved some of\n            its objectives, institutional development was negligible,\n            sustainability is uncertain, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, a feasible timeframe for\n            the necessarily sequential implementation of the\n            cross-sectoral project objectives should form the outline of\n            the lending program. Second, the energetic responsiveness of\n            the beneficiaries to the initial rural outreach activities\n            is a clear confirmation that the second and third project\n            components addressed their felt needs. Third, the\n            performance of the Ministry of Construction was\n            unsatisfactory and compounded the already limited project\n            management capacity of the PIU. Fourth, the management and\n            institutional status of the IDEF satellite centers prevented\n            the required iterative adjustment to client needs. Finally,\n            responsibility for project monitoring would have\n            strengthened the role and credibility of the\n            Interministerial Committee."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -
