Some lessons learned included:\n            institutional assessments to gauge the capacity of not just\n            the Implementing Agency but all involved players in\n            implementation of project activities is critical to\n            assessing the realism of project targets. A centralized\n            procurement strategy for peripheral civil works, although\n            counterintuitive, was more effective as it consolidated\n            small and scattered bids, resulting in all classrooms and\n            latrines at one school being adequately managed in one lot\n            for procurement. Mid-course corrections, when done using\n            strong evidence that align the scope of project activities\n            and targets with IA capacity are critical once an\n            implementation challenge become visible and is a strong\n            justification for changing the course of a project. The Bank\n            can play an important role in turning around project\n            performance through intensive and proactive support when the\n            situation requires. The projects implementation experience\n            from the project indicates that mainstreaming Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) activities is challenging when an\n            implementing agency is weak and there continues to be a need\n            for a dedicated project staff or PIU."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -
