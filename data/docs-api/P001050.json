The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was modest, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, to maximize the impact of future PSD\n            operations, consideration should be given to investment\n            instruments. Second, in future operations, the\n            Government's commitment, along with its action plan to\n            implement difficult reforms, should be obtained prior to\n            Board presentation. Third, the project's achievements\n            should be measured only after sufficient time is allowed for\n            the private sector to regain full confidence in the economy\n            and react more favorably to the Government's\n            pro-private sector policies. Fourth, it is important to\n            conduct in-depth internalization work during project\n            preparation. Finally, it is important to concentrate on a\n            few essentials and resist pressure to overload a project\n            with conditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Private Sector Promotion
