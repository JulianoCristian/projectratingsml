However, the consistent\n            ratings in both operations show likely sustainability, and\n            satisfactory performances from both the Bank, and Borrower.\n            The experience of the two projects, confirm key lessons from\n            the Operations Evaluation Department as follows. The overly\n            ambitious ASAL project design - in addressing both\n            agriculture sector/trade and water reforms - was limited by\n            political constraints, given farmers could not at the same\n            time, pay more for water, and be constricted by the\n            elimination of subsidies, and loss of import protection.\n            Instead, the ASAL could have been an appropriate instrument\n            for institutional reform of the water sector, had the Bank\n            better understood the government's concerns on social,\n            poverty, and employment impacts of higher agricultural water\n            tariffs, and worked in a participatory, more incremental\n            approach to address these concerns. This harmed the\n            Bank's credibility, for although the cross-sectoral and\n            strategic framework for water and agriculture, were\n            supportive (even accepted by stakeholders) of increased\n            water tariffs, at approval time it was clear that a second\n            water tariff increase would be politically unrealistic.\n            Thus, the second tranche release undermined donor\n            partnerships, and mislead the government towards wrongful\n            tariff increases. The above confirms that reforms cannot be\n            imposed, and the Bank needs to be more sensitive to the\n            political economy of reform, acceptability, and timing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Agriculture Sector Adjustment, and\n            Agricultural Sector Technical Support Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Agriculture Sector\n

satisfactory, project sustainability was likely,\n            institutional development was modest, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: where demand\n            management through water tariff increase is problematic,\n            there can be alternative measures (such as handing over to\n            farmers some of the responsibilities and costs) that\n            contribute to the same objective. It is important to build\n            on national ownership and to involve co financiers\n            throughout. The origins of ASAL in joint work and shared\n            analysis led to a high degree of ownership of even\n            politically difficult measures and even in the fast-changing\n            environment that has characterized the country and the\n            region in recent years. Monitoring and evaluation of\n            adjustment is a long-term affair, and it is a mistake to\n            expect quick results as was the case during appraisal.\n            Thorough preparation is a good investment, as implementation\n            is correspondingly smoother. The Bank and Government\n            invested large resources in preparation, but implementation\n            required far less attention."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Agriculture Sector Adjustment

transition\n            to a more sustainable and efficient use of resources,\n            particularly water; and 2) free up markets and enable the\n            private sector to invest, produce and trade in line with\n            Jordan's comparative advantage in agriculture.  The\n            project has three main components.  First, efficient natural\n            resource use will support the transition to an optimal use\n            of water and land resources.  Within an intersectoral water\n            policy framework, ASAL supports comprehensive reforms to: 1)\n            restructure water sector institutions to maximize efficiency\n            and unify planning and management; 2) promote efficient use\n            of existing water resources through demand management; 3)\n            establish control on over-exploited groundwater resources;\n            and 4) prioritize public investments in water.  Second,\n            market liberalization will free up markets and thus\n            encourage private investment and trade to flourish.  The\n            adjustment program supported by ASAL provides for\n            improvements to the incentive structure through the removal\n            of subsidies and price controls, liberalization of external\n            trade and lifting of monopolies.  Internal and external\n            markets in agricultural produce will be deregulated, and\n            there will be deregulation of markets in services and land.\n            Third, institutional development will assure efficient\n            public investment and service provision between the\n            Government and the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Agriculture Sector
