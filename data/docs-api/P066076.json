Some lessons learned\n            includes: judicial reform, including this project, enjoyed\n            this type of strong support during the first three years of\n            this project but less so in the subsequent years. The waning\n            of senior Court management support twenty five (and indeed\n            from the Court as a whole) for the reforms as envisaged at\n            the start of the project, reduced attainment of the\n            project's development outcomes. Protracted procurement\n            procedures and time-consuming management processes requiring\n            heavy involvement by senior officials can undermine reform\n            momentum and project results. Project design could build in\n            'circuit breakers' to allow disengagement during\n            project implementation if certain key assumptions are not\n            fulfilled, or unforeseen events occur. Whenever focus moves\n            from results and implementing agencies shift focus from\n            outcomes to process, reform momentum wanes. Care is needed\n            to ensure that a dedicated Program Management Office (PMO)\n            is well-equipped and supported throughout the project life,\n            and that it works effectively with the judiciary's key\n            operating institutions twenty six, in supporting and\n            coordinating reforms, rather than succumbing to time-driven\n            pressures
