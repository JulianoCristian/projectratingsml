Use of the proposed loan for financing public\n            sector projects eligible for BNDE's financing under its\n            policy statement will be limited to a maximum of 40 percent\n            of the loan amount. There will be a ceiling of $4 million on\n            use of the loan for any single project. The proceeds of the\n            loan will be used to finance direct imports, or the\n            equivalent of 65 percent of the cost of goods, representing\n            the import element of these
