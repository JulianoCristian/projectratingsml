The lessons\n            learned indicate that Problem projects that suffer from weak\n            initial design can be turned around - given concerted\n            efforts by both the Borrower and the Bank -- but there are\n            costs. In difficult institutional conditions, it is\n            especially important to match project ambitions and design\n            not only to borrower priorities but also to sector capacity\n            and broader public sector conditions. The challenges for\n            improving education quality and efficiency should not be\n            underestimated and the results of interventions cannot be\n            assumed. The development of secondary education faces it own\n            specific challenges that cannot be approached in the same\n            way as basic education. The Community Colleges component\n            yielded several lessons for post-secondary training in\n            Yemen: (i) fellowships for tutor training should be\n            conducted within the region whenever possible, to avoid the\n            need for extensive language training, and to increase the\n            likelihood that trainees will return to the country; (ii)\n            continuing to attract high quality applicants may depend on\n            accreditation of programs, with potential routes to further\n            or higher education, requiring in turn more coordination\n            between the Ministries of Technical and Vocational Education\n            and Training (TVET) and Higher Education; (iii) early\n            beneficiary participation is needed to ensure that courses\n            are matched to local demand and that equipment and space\n            needs are correctly identified."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Education Sector Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Education Sector\n            Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5704108/yemen-education-sector-investment-project","projn":"RY-Education Sector -- P005911","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050401085323"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Secondary education","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement, achievements, adult literacy,\n            basic education, classroom construction, classrooms,\n            Colleges, community participation, cost effectiveness,\n            curricula, Curriculum, Curriculum Development, diplomas,\n            Drop out rates, education programs, education projects,\n            education quality, EDUCATION SECTOR, Enrollment, Enrollment\n            Rate, enrollment rates, female teachers, gender parity, GER,\n            girls, girls schools, Gross Enrollment, Human Development,\n            Indicators/Log, interventions, leadership, learning,\n            learning achievement, learning achievements, learning\n            materials, Learning Resources, Lessons Learned, libraries,\n            Library books, Managers, manuals, mathematics, mathematics\n            education, Media, Middle East, Ministries of Education,\n            North Africa, Outcome/achievement, parents, partnership,\n            Population growth, printing, private sector, project\n            identification, project implementation, Project Preparation,\n            public sector, pupils, Quality Assurance, quality control,\n            quality of education, rural areas, rural schools, school\n            buildings, school construction, school libraries, school\n            management, schooling, schools, Secondary education,\n            secondary schools, secondary students, Teacher, teacher\n            development, Teacher Training, teachers, teaching, teaching\n            programs, Tertiary education, textbooks, tutors,\n            unemployment, Vocational Education, YEMEN, youth"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022521-EDUCATION SECTOR INVESTMENT PROJECT,TF022559-PHRD-VOCATIONAL TRAINING,TF029658-PHRD-EDUC.

This will be\n            achieved through a Planned Change Program (PCP) designed to:\n            (a) enhance the learning achievements of secondary students\n            with special emphasis on science and mathematics education\n            and equality of teaching; (b) improve the access of girls to\n            secondary education; and (c) establish labor market oriented\n            two-year post-secondary education programs covering\n            business, commerce and industry. The project includes\n            national and school-based subprojects designed to address\n            the broad policy objectives in eight change areas: physical\n            facilities, teacher performance, curriculum development,\n            school management, learning resources, student evaluation,\n            female access and community colleges. The reforms pursued\n            under the PCP have a long-term perspective which requires\n            evaluation and adjustment at different stages. The sector\n            approach provides the necessary flexibility for making\n            adjustments as the Program progresses, promotes the\n            application of objective criteria for the allocation of\n            funds to subprojects, and encourages cooperation and\n            coordination among beneficiaries through an Intermediary Agency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen - Education Sector\n            Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Yemen - Education\n            Sector Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/02/733018/republic-yemen-education-sector-investment-project","projn":"RY-Education Sector -- P005911","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005121237"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Central government administration,Secondary education","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement,achievements,active\n            participation,addition,basic education,basic\n            needs,Classrooms,community\n            participation,composition,curricula,curriculum,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,economic growth,education progrAms,Education\n            Sector,educational facilities,educational\n            Management,employment,engineering,engineering\n            education,enrollment,enrollment rates,environmental\n            education,ETS,evaluation,female enrollment,financial\n            resources,flu,functional literacy,girls,Human\n            Development,instruction,labor force,labor\n            market,leadership,learning,learning achievements,learning\n            programs,learning resources,levels of\n            education,libraries,library\n            books,literacy,manuals,mathematics,mathematics\n            education,nonformal education,performance indicators,policy\n            analysis,population growth,private sector,qualified\n            teachers,school management,schools,science education,science\n            subjects,science teaching,secondary education,secondary\n            students,student evaluation,teacher,teacher\n            training,teachers,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            techniques,technical education,technical training,training\n            courses,training programs,vocational training,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"achievement,achievements,active\n            participation,addition,basic education,basic\n            needs,Classrooms,community\n            participation,composition,curricula,curriculum,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,economic growth,education progrAms,Education\n            Sector,educational facilities,educational\n            Management,employment,engineering,engineering\n            education,enrollment,enrollment rates,environmental\n            education,ETS,evaluation,female enrollment,financial\n            resources,flu,functional literacy,girls,Human\n            Development,instruction,labor force,labor\n            market,leadership,learning,learning achievements,learning\n            programs,learning resources,levels of\n            education,libraries,library\n            books,literacy,manuals,mathematics,mathematics\n            education,nonformal education,performance indicators,policy\n            analysis,population growth,private sector,qualified\n            teachers,school management,schools,science education,science\n            subjects,science teaching,secondary education,secondary\n            students,student evaluation,teacher,teacher\n            training,teachers,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            techniques,technical education,technical training,training\n            courses,training programs,vocational training,workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF029658-PHRD-EDUC.
