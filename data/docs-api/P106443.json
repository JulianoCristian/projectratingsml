Some lessons learned included: the\n            institutionalization of reforms requires a long-term\n            commitment on the part of government and the donor community\n            to support the reform agenda. School based management (SBM)\n            is an important tool for decentralizing an education system\n            and improving learning outcomes. Public private partnerships\n            are important for ensuring the long-term availability of\n            adequate resources to support community schools. Solid\n            analytical studies on system reforms during the\n            implementation period are essential for making appropriate\n            decisions on the elimination of bottlenecks to the reform\n            agenda.
