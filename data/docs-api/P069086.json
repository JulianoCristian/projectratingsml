Some lessons learned included:\n            community-based initiatives need to be integrated and\n            coordinated with the broader poverty reduction strategy of\n            the government in order to effectively tackle poverty\n            reduction. The CPRP is an example of a project that was\n            likely more successful than the M&E data can possibly\n            tell. Key indicators were regularly collected and used by\n            state agencies to carry out desk and field assessments of\n            proposals, as well as the selection and funding of\n            micro-projects, and to monitor the realization of the\n            community infrastructure.

Community-development\n            projects, when properly designed, have the potential of\n            addressing the needs of community members who are\n            traditionally marginalized or not

Community Based Poverty Reduction Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Community Based Poverty\n            Reduction Project for Nigeria were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: local\n            government areas (LGAs) are the closest link to government,\n            and any project that is oriented towards capacity\n            development at the grassroots level must make provision for\n            involvement of the LGAs. The project selection method under\n            the Community Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP) gave\n            communities voice and allowed them to participate in the\n            decision making process with the ability to conceive\n            communal goals, prioritize projects, and select projects for\n            funding through participatory methods. LGAs should be\n            encouraged to follow this method of selection of capital\n            projects for communities such that beneficiary communities\n            are given the opportunity to participate in decisions\n            concerning annual budgets for LGAs. With the CPRP approach,\n            communities can be effective partners with government and\n            LGAs in reducing their poverty. The partnering of the LGAs\n            with the CPRP to staff the schools and the clinics under the\n            project is one of the success stories of the project. Future\n            projects should consider this kind of partnership to be a\n            standing arrangement under the project. The project\n            demonstrated that, with proper sensitization women can fully\n            participate in community-driven development (CDD) projects.\n            As anticipated in the design and the target set for the\n            project, the majority (about 70 percent) of the project\n            beneficiaries were women. Some of the non-beneficiary\n            communities have gone ahead and replicated the financing\n            structure of the CPRP and have started self-help projects in\n            their communities.

The additional financing to the current\n            participating States to complete the original project\n            activities will therefore: (i) ensure that all\n            micro-projects are completed at the close of the project;\n            (ii) increase the project's impact and development\n            effectiveness; and (iii) serve as a bridging fund - pending\n            the commencement of the National Community Driven\n            Development Program (National CDD) as a follow-on to the\n            Community-based Poverty Reduction Project (CPRP).
