Some lessons\n            learned included: flexibility during implementation is\n            critical to successful outcomes. When a project is designed,\n            it's not possible to envision all potential scenarios.\n            Being able to drop and add activities and redirect resources\n            in response to changing circumstances is essential.\n            Notwithstanding the flexibility exercised regarding\n            activities, the Bank missed an opportunity during the\n            mid-term review to formally change the PDO related to\n            outstanding treasury securities traded on the secondary\n            market. The Bank coordination with other development\n            partners can work well when, as demonstrated in this\n            project: their respective activities are done in parallel\n            and not dependent upon each other; the government wants it\n            and finds value for a broader base of funding; and the Bank\n            team is ready to devote considerable time and energy to lead\n            the effort including with a field-based Task Team Leader.\n            This lesson will resonate as the Bank considers the nature\n            of its future support to the
