The project substantially\n            achieved its physical objectives. As for the direct outcomes\n            of the project, the results are mixed. The best result was\n            obtained in the field of public expenditure practices which\n            improved over the project life. This credit must be shared\n            however, with the Bank's overall effort in Madagascar\n            to improve public expenditures. The project did not succeed\n            in developing local human resources and the domestic\n            construction industry in a sustainable manner. Finally, the\n            project has not achieved a great deal in strengthening the\n            overall capacity of the Ministere des Travaux Publics (MTP),\n            mainly because of frequent rotation of staff. However, in\n            some areas, such as programming of road maintenance works\n            and maintaining a road inventory, the project made\n            significant achievements. The next road operation in\n            Madagascar should be part of a Transport Sector Project\n            under preparation, with a Board date planned for December\n            1996 for the road sub sector. This project should deal with\n            maintenance and safety only. The funding of road maintenance\n            should be secured through a slightly different Road Fund\n            mechanism than in the Seventh Highway Project design. A road\n            management unit should be installed within MTP to carry out\n            systematic surveys of pavement condition and traffic and\n            calculate the road user charge necessary to cover the\n            optimum maintenance costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -

To that end the Government has\n            prepared a comprehensive four year rehabilitation and\n            maintenance program for this national asset of which the\n            Seventh Highway Project is a part. Specifically the project\n            will provide for rehabilitation and maintenance of main\n            roads and priority feeeder roads. It will also provide for\n            restructuring and role strengthening of the Ministry of\n            Public Works (MTP), the decentralization of its functions\n            and the contracting of maintenance works to private\n            contractors. Training will be provided to upgrade the skills\n            of domestic contractors. Changes will be made in the CATP\n            (MTP Training school) to enhance the validity of its\n            diplomas and certificates. Finally, consultant services will\n            be provided to assist in project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Seventh Highway
