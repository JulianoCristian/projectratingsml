finance management and\n            its urban infrastructural program. The project, itself,\n            contains two subprojects dealing with public finance and\n            urban development. Both include provision of expatriate\n            resident specialists, consulting services, training and\n            related local expenditures. The public finance subproject\n            seeks to: (i) improve the management by the Caisse\n            Congolaise d'Amortissement of existing external\n            indebtedness and the acquisition of new borrowings on terms\n            appropriate to each development project; (ii) increase the\n            Ministry of Finance's capacity to make as required\n            short-term adjustments in public finance operations and to\n            resolve structural problems; and (iii) increase the\n            Ministry's capacity to manage the Government's\n            financial relationship with Congo's public enterprise\n            system. The urban subproject aims to: (i) increase the\n            capacity of municipal and central Government technical\n            services; and (ii) increase municipal revenues and improve\n            their financial management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo - Technical Assistance
