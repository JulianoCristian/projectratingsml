The\n            confluence of several factors, namely, an overly ambitious\n            project design, lack of institutional capacity and staff\n            continuity, coupled with weak decision-making, affected the\n            project outcome. The lessons convey that complex, and\n            difficult privatization projects, are further menaced by the\n            unpredictable interplay of several economic forces, thus the\n            inclusion of monitoring indicators and impact evaluation,\n            would facilitate periodic reviews on relevant project\n            interventions, and allow compliance with a clearly defined\n            project design. Furthermore, periodic reviews should be\n            supplemented by personal, detailed insights from the\n            concerned minister, to convey accountability, and, speed\n            significant actions if problems, or delays occur. The\n            administration of the project was particularly affected by\n            the lack of capacity, and instruments to support project\n            management, therefore it is suggested that Special Accounts\n            be used only when internal control procedures are in place\n            in the project management unit, and ensure that documented\n            reconciliations be made prior to requested replenishments,\n            secured by strong financial management, and accounting\n            practices. The sensitivity of key project positions,\n            requires a joint agreed decision prior to appraisal, between\n            the Bank, and the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Trinidad and Tobago -
