Regardless of\n            success, some lessons from the experience of the project\n            follows. The difficulty in ensuring full government\n            ownership, particularly in post-conflict settings, combined\n            with support from multiple donors should not be\n            underestimated. Adequate time and resources during project\n            preparation should be allocated to that effect, to achieve\n            the appropriate project design. The project has confirmed\n            the value of supporting sector-wide programs; it has helped\n            the government put together an overall, sector strategy that\n            could be jointly financed by donors and the government.\n            Nonetheless, it is suggested that future operations, be\n            given careful attention to the design of monitoring and\n            evaluation systems, including the choice of appropriate\n            indicators, the establishment of a baseline, the balance\n            between routine data collection, and periodic surveys, and\n            the inclusion of monitoring and evaluation specialists in\n            the program management team. In addition, the Bank should\n            anticipate the client's needs in relation to the\n            setting up of a well-staffed project management unit,\n            appropriate internal control systems, and developing terms\n            of reference and procedures to monitor the performance of\n            consultants and contractors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -

Project, is the improvement of the health status of\n            the population, in general, and a decrease in infant and\n            child mortality, in particular. MHS objectives are to be\n            achieved through an increase in health coverage of the\n            population from the present 40 percent level to 60 percent\n            by the turn of the century, with better quality of services\n            provided. The project supports the same objectives as the\n            MHS, addressing urban/rural inequities, improvement of staff\n            training and institutional development. The project will\n            address the following areas: 1) resumption of and\n            improvement in the quality of health services provided; 2)\n            promotion and improvement of sector institutions, support\n            services and sub-national health management systems;
