The lessons learned show that the\n            programs addressing crisis situations work when there are\n            dynamic teams in the Government and the Bank that are able\n            to bring together the necessary expertise and to take\n            necessary decisions and actions to bring about quickly the\n            needed support in the case of the bank and the policy\n            changes in the case of the Government. The Structural\n            Adjustment Credit (SAC) was designed and approved in four\n            months, ahead of the IMF program, an approach which was\n            supported by the IMF. Identification of key measures and\n            simplicity are critical to the success of reform programs in\n            general, but particularly of those geared to addressing\n            severe short-term imbalances. The program targeted a few key\n            reforms which were central to the reform program. This\n            reduced the burden on Government and ensured that it focused\n            on key issues. Experience with the Cape Verde program\n            confirms the importance of Government commitment and buy in\n            of all stakeholders in bringing about needed changes. Close\n            coordination within the Bank increases the effectiveness of\n            Bank assistance and reduces costs. During preparation and\n            supervision of the SAC, Bank teams in different units worked\n            closely together and with the IMF and other donors. There is\n            a need to provide appropriate Technical Assistance resources\n            to support the implementation of the adjustment measures.\n            The availability of SAC PPF reflows, (amounts left from the\n            original allocation that were preserved in a project\n            account), which the Government agreed to utilize for studies\n            and capacity building and other sources of financing allowed\n            for essential technical work on key structural and budget\n            measures mentioned in the Letter of Development Policy\n            (LDP), including petroleum sector reform, the Public\n            Expenditure Review (PER), the assessment of the pension\n            system, and the analysis carried out on investment\n            incentives by Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cape Verde - Structural\n

Verde, and alleviate the impact of the oil shock, by\n            creating the conditions for sustained high GDP growth. The\n            project will therefore support the Government's\n            stabilization program, by implementing structural reforms in\n            the petroleum sector, supporting an accelerated\n            privatization program in the transport, and infrastructure\n            sector, and by creating an environment, conducive to private\n            sector development, thus enhancing revenue mobilization, in\n            addition to fiscal strengthening, and balance of payments\n            sustainability. While the main risk of the program is\n            related to policy reversal, it is moderated by the fact that\n            tax reform, and privatization are largely irreversible.\n            Furthermore, the country's track record during most of\n            the 1990s in terms of high growth, and poverty alleviation\n            is good. Nevertheless, there were two instances where\n            macroeconomic slippages occurred, leading to internal debt\n            problems, though the Government responded with effective\n            remedial measures. Hence, based on Government commitments,\n            it is expected that the project will help ease the causes of\n            overruns, such as petroleum subsidies, that the strong civil\n            society support in government stabilization actions, and,\n            the proposed reforms - which will enhance the business\n            environment - will outweigh potential
