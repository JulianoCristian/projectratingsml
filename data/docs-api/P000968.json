Some lessons learned included:\n            combining in one operation: (i) investment lending for a\n            very large number of activities; and (ii) a broad\n            institutional reform agenda concerning several centralized\n            and decentralized organizations.

accelerate agricultural growth that results\n            in increased food security, reduced poverty, and\n            conservation of the natural resource base. 2) Institutional\n            reform

Agricultural Services Sector Investment\n            Project covers three sectoral, regional, and indirect\n            issues: reforming agricultural technology generation;\n            institutional strengthening, and reform of the Ministry of\n            Food and Agriculture; and, development of farmer-based\n            organizations, which includes agricultural training. The\n            project, mainly service, and research oriented, could\n            generate adverse agricultural interventions on the\n            environment, such as bio-diversity loss, and land, and water\n            resources degradation, resulting in soil fertility loss, and\n            erosion. Mitigating measures specify that: 1) degradation of\n            productive systems affecting crops, would be compensated\n            through a built-in natural resource management program, to\n            match crop species with site suitability criteria.\n            Fertilizer trials will recommend appropriate dosage, and\n            application for specific types of soil; 2) agricultural\n            technology diffusion, will refocus on the management of\n            natural resources in the provision of environmental\n            extension services, through improved soil, and water\n            conservation methods, and include community participation;\n            3) improvement of communal grazing areas, monitoring of\n            improved breeds, and, application of non-polluting methods\n            for tsetse control, will curtail endangered livestock; and,\n            4) aquatic fauna will be monitored, and culture effluents\n            will be
