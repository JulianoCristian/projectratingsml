The\n            key lessons learned from this project are: 1) The project\n            could have benefited from a more comprehensive approach to\n            addressing the problems of the energy sector, and\n            particularly from a more deliberate and stronger connection\n            to the downstream energy companies. Development of a\n            stronger IDA relationship with those downstream companies\n            might have helped alleviate the coal payments arrears\n            issues. 2) The use of a numerical target as part of the\n            project's main development objective proved to be\n            imprecise, compared to a more strategic development goal. 3)\n            The development of the Energy Project as part of a broader\n            energy assistance program, proved to be a very important\n            factor in IDA's ability to convince the government to\n            address its failures to meet assurances during this first\n            energy project. 4) At the outset of this project in\n            Mongolia, IDA could complete this project in time mainly\n            because the project design was simple, the objective was\n            focused, and there was only one principal beneficiary. 5)\n            The appointment of an internationally experienced financial\n            auditor by Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC) to audit the\n            project and corporate accounts, as IDA's initial\n            insistence, proved to be particularly important and\n            beneficial to BJSC in this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Coal Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Coal

levels at the Baganuur\n            mine to 4 million tons per year. Additional, associated\n            objectives are for Baganuur Joint Stock Company (BJSC) to:\n            1) develop financial self-sufficiency; 2) increase equipment\n            productivity and improve efficiency; 3) operate as an\n            independent commercial company; and 4) operate in an\n            environmentally acceptable manner over the long term. The\n            principal components of the project are: 1) procurement and\n            commissioning of equipment to rehabilitate the Baganuur coal\n            mine operation; 2) procurement and turnkey installation and\n            commissioning of equipment for a coal-handling plant\n            consisting of crusher, linear stacker, underground reclaimer\n            and train-loader; and 3) technical assistance to BJSC\n            including in-country and overseas training to: (a) improve\n            mine operations and mine supervision practices and\n            procedures; (b) develop mine maintenance management and\n            materials management systems; (c) upgrade financial and cost\n            accounting/management information systems; and (d) improve\n            environmental management capabilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Coal Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Coal Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/04/696625/mongolia-coal-project","projn":"MN-Mongolia Coal Proj. -- P035697","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Montreal Protocol,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Mongolia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961022111453"},"subsc":"Mining and other extractive","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1996","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ash,balance of payments,basic\n            energy,boilers,calorific value,capital\n            requirements,Coal,coal,Coal Consumption,Coal Demand,coal\n            mining,coal prices,Coal Production,Coal\n            Use,combustion,Commercial Energy,commercial\n            enterprises,conditionality,Cost\n            Analysis,crushing,Debt,demand growth,district heat,district\n            heating,district heating system,Domestic coal,economic\n            activity,Economic Analysis,economic growth,efficiency of\n            energy,efficiency of energy use,electric\n            power,electricity,electricity prices,electricity\n            production,Electricity sales,electricity supply,Energy\n            Balance,energy companies,Energy demand,energy\n            infrastructure,energy production,Energy Supply,energy\n            systems,Environmental Management,exchange rate,fuel,fuel\n            oil,heat\n            production,imports,income,Inflation,legislation,lignite,machinery,Marginal\n            Cost,Mines,Net imports,oil,oil\n            equivalent,PE,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,Petroleum\n            product,petroleum product prices,Petroleum products,power\n            systems,primary energy,Primary energy\n            production,producers,production,Production Costs,production\n            levels,productivity,public expenditures,quality\n            control,Safety,Safety Management,stabilization,sulfur,tax\n            reforms,temperature,Thermal power,transport,urban\n            centers,urban population"},"1":{"cdata!":"ash,balance of payments,basic\n            energy,boilers,calorific value,capital\n            requirements,Coal,coal,Coal Consumption,Coal Demand,coal\n            mining,coal prices,Coal Production,Coal\n            Use,combustion,Commercial Energy,commercial\n            enterprises,conditionality,Cost\n            Analysis,crushing,Debt,demand growth,district heat,district\n            heating,district heating system,Domestic coal,economic\n            activity,Economic Analysis,economic growth,efficiency of\n            energy,efficiency of energy use,electric\n            power,electricity,electricity prices,electricity\n            production,Electricity sales,electricity supply,Energy\n            Balance,energy companies,Energy demand,energy\n            infrastructure,energy production,Energy Supply,energy\n            systems,Environmental Management,exchange rate,fuel,fuel\n            oil,heat\n            production,imports,income,Inflation,legislation,lignite,machinery,Marginal\n            Cost,Mines,Net imports,oil,oil\n            equivalent,PE,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,Petroleum\n            product,petroleum product prices,Petroleum products,power\n            systems,primary energy,Primary energy\n            production,producers,production,Production Costs,production\n            levels,productivity,public expenditures,quality\n            control,Safety,Safety Management,stabilization,sulfur,tax\n            reforms,temperature,Thermal power,transport,urban\n            centers,urban population"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029179-PHRD-COAL PROJECT","repnb":"15322"},"facets":{}}}
