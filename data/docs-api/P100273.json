Some lessons learned included: in\n            designing an emergency intervention, it is important to\n            distinguish between immediate response and longer-term\n            capacity building activities. The latter are often included\n            to build capacity to deal with future emergencies. However,\n            such activities usually benefit from longer preparation and\n            coordination with other sector interventions. Stronger\n            Management oversight is needed to ensure that project\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is actually utilized as\n            a management tool for effective project implementation.\n            Persistent occurrence of H5N1 infections in poultry around\n            the world means that conditions for the mutation of the\n            virus continue to prevail, including in Albania, where\n            biosecurity levels remain weak on poultry farms. Greater\n            effort is needed, both globally and in Albania, to improve\n            surveillance in backyard poultry systems and wild-life to\n            reduce risks. Early cooperation with UN agencies and\n            international technical organizations can offer synergy and\n            provide a basis for sustaining at least some programs on\n            project closure. More effective ways of working with the\n            media to communicate disease risks are needed to avoid panic\n            and build public confidence."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Avian

Some lessons learned include: a global\n            template can enable rapid, good project design. The Global\n            Program for Avian Influenza (GPAI) PAD was ill place and was\n            used as the basis for the preparation of this project. The\n            existence of a sound, global plan ensures that an effective\n            project can be formulated relatively rapidly at a time of\n            urgency, due to uncertain circumstances related to an\n            emerging infectious disease. Projects formulated for a\n            specific disease can prove to have too narrow and,\n            therefore, require restructuring. Close coordination with\n            specialized United Nations (UN) agencies can enhance the\n            quality of technical assistance. Too many key indicators for\n            an emergency project can make monitoring and evaluation\n            cumbersome. Data collection and analysis can be a daunting\n            task, particularly when there is no full-time staff\n            responsible for it. School teachers can play an important\n            role in behavior change and health promotion. Health-related\n            public awareness and communication activities in Albania\n            should target school teachers to maximize effectiveness, not\n            only when children are identified as key beneficiaries, but\n            also because children can influence their families and\n            others. Video conference and training with a health expert\n            can be very cost effective. Linking in-country specialists\n            with international experts was successful and should be\n            considered in other projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Avian Influenza Control

Avian Influenza Control and Human\n            Pandemic Preparedness and Response (APL) Project for Albania\n            aims to strengthen the country's capacity to prevent\n            the spread of avian influenza among poultry, to prevent the\n            transmission of avian influenza from birds to other animals\n            and humans, and to prepare for a potential pandemic of Avian\n            Flu transmissible between humans. There are four project\n            components. 1. Public Awareness and Information Campaign\n            will include: a) risk communication; and b) communication\n            for behavior change. This component will help develop and\n            implement a communications plan to inform the public,\n            particularly those more likely to be exposed to the Avian\n            Flu, about its threat and how they can minimize the risk of\n            transmission and spread of disease. 2. Animal Health\n            Component will include: a) enhancing Avian Flu prevention\n            and preparedness capability; b) strengthening Avian Flu\n            control programs and outbreak containment programs; c)\n            strengthening disease control capacities, and improving\n            surveillance, diagnostic capacities, and applied research\n            and will support a national program to develop and implement\n            short- and long-term HPAI prevention, containment, and\n            control and eradication activities in animals. 3. Human\n            Health Component will include: a) enhancing coordination and\n            program planning; b) strengthening national public health\n            surveillance system; and c) strengthening health care\n            response capacity. 4. Avian Influenza Task Force Component\n            will support the Avian Influenza Task Force in implementing\n            the government's Avian Flu response strategy (including\n            components 1-3 above), and will comprise two subcomponents:\n            a) strengthening the Task Force by establishing a permanent\n            secretariat; and b) monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Avian Influenza Conrol and Human\n            Pandemic Preparedness and Response (APL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Avian Influenza
