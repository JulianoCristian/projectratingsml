The lessons learned include the\n            following: Integration Systems Sustainability - project\n            implementation gave a general overview of a river basin\n            integration system. It also gave a realistic view of the\n            challenges involved in the implementation of an integration\n            system, showing that financial sustainability will only be\n            guaranteed by substantial urban and industrial demand,\n            irrigation water demand alone being insufficient. Operations\n            and Maintenance Plans - revealed the need to attach much\n            more priority to the administration, operation and\n            maintenance of hydraulic infrastructures. Sector Policies\n            Integration - it also showed that activities carried out by\n            the Secretariat for Water Resources (SRH), involving water\n            resources management and the implementation of priority\n            works, require similar state sector policies. Social\n            Organization - it revealed the need for a permanent core\n            group to organize meetings with river basin users and\n            committees as a way of guaranteeing democratic access to\n            information and to enrich discussions in terms of the most\n            feasible alternatives for activity implementation.\n            Infrastructure Management - it clearly demonstrated the need\n            to renovate, maintain and properly manage existing\n            infrastructure, including access to information regarding\n            the condition, safety and operational strategy of existing\n            systems. Planning - the project cleared demonstrated that a\n            careful and participatory planning process offers a solid\n            foundation and should be a requirement for the\n            implementation of water resources infrastructure. Water\n            Resources Management - integrated water resources management\n            involves a complex set of actions focusing on structural and\n            non-structural (soft) activities to balance supply and\n            demand and to manage conflicts, especially in situations\n            where water is scarce. Social-environmental Concerns -\n            greater attention must be paid to social and environmental\n            issues as a means of guaranteeing the sustainability and\n            effective use of water resources systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Ceara Water Resources Management\n            Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Ceara Water Resources\n
