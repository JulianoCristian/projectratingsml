The lessons learned included the following:\n            (1) the Project showed that the achievements of the\n            activities and their sustainability were strengthened when\n            it was able to work in coordination with other national\n            agencies (INDEC, other Secretariats or Ministries); (2) the\n            usefulness of the funding mechanisms to finance the\n            Subprojects was apparent and although their social or\n            sanitary impact was reduced, they serve as producers of\n            local capabilities that strengthen the development of\n            national and provincial policies; (3) an adjustment of the\n            administrative procedures and the strengthening of local\n            management capacities is needed, in order to successfully\n            complete these sub-projects; (4) the strategy used through\n            the operational research projects and the support provided\n            to the municipalities made it possible to expand the public\n            capacity and mobilize civil society resources; and (5) one\n            of the principal lessons in the relation with the provinces\n            is the need to structure a national surveillance and health\n            promotion system with sufficient resources and active\n            presence beyond the weaknesses of the institutional capacity\n            of the provinces."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Public Health Surveillance and\n            Disease Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Public Health\n            Surveillance and Disease Control Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/11/7323176/argentina-public-health-surveillance-disease-control-project","projn":"AR-Pub.

The\n            components call for: 1) strengthening the public health\n            surveillance system, to be implemented nationally. It will\n            strengthen the Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS)\n            institutional capacity, in order to make informed decisions\n            on prevention control, better monitor changes in health\n            trends, and allocate resources effectively. 2) Improved\n            disease control, will be strengthened through institutional\n            building at provincial levels, to better monitor disease,\n            control and prevent such diseases. Namely, febrile\n            illnesses, such as tuberculosis and dengue, in high\n            incidence areas will be controlled, as well as other\n            infectious and emergent diseases. 3) The health promotion\n            component will strengthen MSAS capacity, to implement a\n            strategic promotion on health, through education, social\n            mobilization, and policy advocacy. Training will be provided\n            for dissemination practices, and required infrastructure\n            rehabilitation and equipment, will be provided under this\n            component. 4) Administrative costs will finance the Project\n            Coordinating Unit over a four year period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Public Health Surveillance and\n            Disease Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Public Health\n            Surveillance and Disease Control Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/09/439547/argentina-public-health-surveillance-disease-control-project","projn":"AR-Pub.
