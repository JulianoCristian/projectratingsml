        completed and at a cost below appraisal estimates. The\n            TRENSURB rapid transit line was constructed and technical\n            assistance was provided to establish its management and\n            operating company. However, the failure to implement\n            complementary measures is having a negative effect on\n            TRENSURB's operational and financial performance. The\n            ultimate success of the project is contingent on the\n            resumption of economic growth in the region and on the\n            implementation of complementary measures such as bus\n            integration and car parking restrictions. The most serious\n            shortcoming of the project was the failure to undertake and\n            implement a public transport tariff study as originally\n            envisaged. One major lesson learned is that, in cases where\n            there is a need for substantial policy and implementation\n            decisions involving different levels of Government agencies\n            subject to conflicting political and social pressures, their\n            commitment should be realistically assessed during\n            preparation. Regarding the original objective of TRENSURB\n            covering its working costs, the appraisal was unrealistic to\n            expect that this would take place during the initial\n            operation period. The rail system must first demonstrate its\n            reliability to users. In the meantime, TRENSURB should\n            undertake a staff review to streamline costs and conduct a\n            tariff study to determine the optimal user charges. The Bank\n            should closely follow up the implementation of these tasks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Urban Transport (Porto\n            Alegre)

     mass transit system with about 25 electric unit trains\n            between the central business area of the city of Porto\n            Alegre, the capital of the southern state of Rio Grande do\n            Sul, and the town of Sapucaia, 26.7 kms to the north. The\n            system will have 14 stations spaced approximately every 2\n            kms, and will have a capacity of 48,000 passengers per hour\n            in each direction. The benefits of the project will mainly\n            accrue to the urban poor, many of whom live on the periphery\n            of the metropolitan area, providing them with more rapid\n            access to employment centers and improving the urban\n            environment in which they live.

     mass transit system with about 25 electric unit trains\n            between the central business area of the city of Porto\n            Alegre, the capital of the southern state of Rio Grande do\n            Sul, and the town of Sapucaia, 26.7 kms to the north. The\n            system will have 14 stations spaced approximately every 2\n            kms, and will have a capacity of 48,000 passengers per hour\n            in each direction. The benefits of the project will mainly\n            accrue to the urban poor, many of whom live on the periphery\n            of the metropolitan area, providing them with more rapid\n            access to employment centers and improving the urban\n            environment in which they live. The project will save on\n            vehicle operating costs including fuel, reduce travel time,\n            and reduce air and noise pollution by achieving a more\n            efficient modal distribution of traffic and use of all\n            transport facilities in the area of influence of the\n            railway. It will contribute to the development of selected\n            employment growth poles along the north-south corridor. The\n            project involves the establishment of the company, TRENSURB,\n            which was recently created to own and operate the system on\n            a commercial basis without government operating subsidies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Urban Transport (Porto\n            Alegre) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Second Urban Transport\n
