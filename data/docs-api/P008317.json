Key lessons suggest that the existence of a\n            well-defined multi-year program, as a pre-requisite to\n            project design, contributed to a successful implementation,\n            particularly given the fact that as a one tranche operation,\n            completion of critical performance benchmarks had to be\n            supported, while Government commitments to sustained reforms\n            needed reinforcement. However, the use of a single tranche\n            adjustment loan was appropriate due to country conditions,\n            for it provided flexibility to enable both the Government,\n            and the Bank, assess the experience in program\n            implementation, and strengthen the program as needed. This\n            adjustment process would have been difficult under a\n            multi-tranche operation. In addition, parallel operations\n            focused on reforms, provided a timely, and well coordinated\n            comprehensive framework in the reform agenda, which could\n            not have been accomplished had all reforms been incorporated\n            into this one project, and, the complementary nature of the\n            project was conducive to an excellent communication, and\n            coordination between the Bank, and the Fund. Nonetheless,\n            the lack of an accompanying technical assistance loan, and\n            the subsequent reliance on donors, required intensive\n            coordination of donor activities,
