Some lessons learned included:  the\n            offer of an incentive bonus to the contractor as the\n            implementation of Tagum - Mati road was a success wherein\n            the contractor was induced to complete the project on time.\n            Completing the work on time despite the odds served as an\n            indicator of competence as the contractor is concerned. The\n            adoption of such practice is recommended for future\n            projects. Whilst there will be a need for engaging\n            international consultants and international contractors to\n            undertake very large road rehabilitation projects, optimum\n            institution building could be achieved in respect of\n            Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) contractors\n            by maintaining sub-project sizes at a reasonable level which\n            is not too high to shut out the experienced large scale\n            local contractors, and at the same time be attractive to\n            encourage the participation of competent foreign\n            contractors. The best method of developing the local\n            construction industry is to offer them opportunities to\n            perform, which in turn will encourage them to invest in\n            better types of equipment which they lack."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
