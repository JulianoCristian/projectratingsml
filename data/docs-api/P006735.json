Common facilities centers program was off to a\n            good start.  The Rural Development Centers were striving to\n            regain its directions after going through drastic changes.\n            The Las Gaviotas Rural Development Services Center benefited\n            in terms of its physical plant, primary school and related\n            facilities. Other components of the project did not do as\n            well.  Completion of the project required 8.75 years when it\n            was estimated to only take 4 years.  Delays in project\n            implementation were caused by: new laws enacted by a new\n            government, fund shortages and poor project management. The\n            Bank neglected to predict how the project would be perceived\n            by a new government, which took power just eight months\n            after the project took effect.  The project design should\n            have been more flexible so if future changes were necessary\n            that could be made without drastic modification.\n            Construction and equipment costs were high for both common\n            facilities centers program and rural development centers.\n            This was a result of inflationary increases during\n            implementation which took almost nine years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
