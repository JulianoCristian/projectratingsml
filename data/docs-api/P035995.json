Lessons stipulate that by and large, the\n            economic environment determines the outcome of a project,\n            namely through a combination of strong economic policies,\n            economic growth, export demand, and the state and depth of\n            the financial sector. Nonetheless, despite limitations on\n            this account, a line of credit operation can have\n            significant impacts on investment, employment, and foreign\n            exchange earnings, due to the leverage it may exercise, and\n            the institutional improvements it may induce. Several\n            factors contributed to the success of the project: the\n            specific objectives, and instruments of the project were\n            narrowly focused on term finance, and the use of the line of\n            credit; there was unmet demand for term finance; and,\n            financially sound banks participated, giving adequate\n            attention to sub-loans. However, the export development\n            objective, in the absence of any targeting of sub-loans, had\n            no essential link to the use of the credit line, which led\n            to difficulties in project supervision, and in the Quality\n            Assurance Group review. Thus, components, and performance\n            indicators should be clearly linked, and consistent with\n            each other at the time of entry. Furthermore, consideration\n            should be given to adapting requirements prudently, and in\n            accordance with private sector needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Export Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan -

The major\n            component of the project is a line of credit under which\n            subloans will finance the following: 1) viable medium- and\n            longer-term investments in plant and machinery in productive\n            activities; 2) permanent working capital, marketing and\n            training associated with new investments; and 3) investments\n            in energy
