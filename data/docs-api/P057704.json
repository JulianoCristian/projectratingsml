ports and ancillary services in line\n            with the CAS objectives of promoting private sector\n            development and growth in exports. The project will\n            restructure the organizational and financial systems in the\n            sector and attract private investment to manage and operate\n            publicly-held enterprises in the sector. The project funds\n            the  operating expenses of the Secretariat Unit and provides\n            technical assistance in three phases: 1) Phase 1 assesses\n            deficiencies in trade logistics and potential for container\n            transshipment at Egyptian ports and recommends a strategy to\n            improve efficiency; and develops specifications and bid\n            documents for port/trade management systems including EDI\n            (Electronic Data Interchange) systems to facilitate trade.\n            2) Phase 2 develops a policy framework which accommodates\n            greater private participation in ports; and produces draft\n            regulations for the port sector to implement the new policy\n            of private participation. 3) Phase 3 a) creates a new\n            structure for a corporatized organization in the sector and\n            assists in its implementation; b) restructures the financial\n            management systems for port sector entities to make them\n            autonomous and self-financing; and c) develops a plan for\n            privatizing selected units and a labor redeployment program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Port Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Port Sector Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/05/693546/egypt-port-sector-reform-project","projn":"EG-Port Sector Reform -- P057704","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Ports & Waterways,Environmental Economics & Policies,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Transport Security","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980624143040"},"subsc":"Law and justice,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-2","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,Auditing,autonomy,Banking\n            Sector,Banking Sector Reforms,borrowing,capital\n            expenditures,cargo,cargo\n            handling,cargoes,containerization,currency,economic\n            analysis,economic growth,Employment,environmental\n            protection,Exchange Rate,Financial Accounting,financial\n            autonomy,financial management,financial management\n            systems,financial reporting,financial systems,Financing\n            Sources,FISCAL YEAR,freight,hazardous\n            materials,imports,inspection,inspection\n            procedures,international shipping,international\n            waterways,key performance indicators,labor\n            unions,liquidation,local governments,Maritime\n            Transport,Ministries of Finance,monopolies,ocean\n            freight,ocean freight rates,oil,Operating Costs,OPERATING\n            EXPENSES,Port,port authorities,port efficiency,port\n            facilities,port industry,port operating companies,port\n            operations,Port Sector,port security,port\n            services,ports,ports industry,private sector,private sector\n            participation,privatization,productivity,public\n            enterprises,public sector,public service,Regulatory\n            framework,regulatory\n            regime,reorganization,retirement,shipping\n            lines,tax,Technical Assistance,units"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,Auditing,autonomy,Banking\n            Sector,Banking Sector Reforms,borrowing,capital\n            expenditures,cargo,cargo\n            handling,cargoes,containerization,currency,economic\n            analysis,economic growth,Employment,environmental\n            protection,Exchange Rate,Financial Accounting,financial\n            autonomy,financial management,financial management\n            systems,financial reporting,financial systems,Financing\n            Sources,FISCAL YEAR,freight,hazardous\n            materials,imports,inspection,inspection\n            procedures,international shipping,international\n            waterways,key performance indicators,labor\n            unions,liquidation,local governments,Maritime\n            Transport,Ministries of Finance,monopolies,ocean\n            freight,ocean freight rates,oil,Operating Costs,OPERATING\n            EXPENSES,Port,port authorities,port efficiency,port\n            facilities,port industry,port operating companies,port\n            operations,Port Sector,port security,port\n            services,ports,ports industry,private sector,private sector\n            participation,privatization,productivity,public\n            enterprises,public sector,public service,Regulatory\n            framework,regulatory\n            regime,reorganization,retirement,shipping\n            lines,tax,Technical Assistance,units"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"17773"},"facets":{}}}
