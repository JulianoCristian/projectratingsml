The Country Assistance\n            Strategy and the project objectives have been consistent.\n            The project design also closely reflected the\n            government's priorities as set out in their Road Sector\n            Expenditure Program for 1996-2000. The Bank also helped to\n            underscore the need to halt negotiated contracts, bring the\n            major cause of the arrears problem to a close. Key lessons\n            learned are as follows: The study undertaken to monitor the\n            poverty impact of road rehabilitated and maintained under\n            the project established direct correlation between improved\n            road condition and access to higher order social facilities.\n            The study also found other benefits accruing to people\n            living along the rehabilitated roads. The project attests to\n            the importance of program concept, which recognizes that\n            road networks are interdependent, and thus improvements and\n            extensions to the network must be planned within the context\n            of the whole. The arrears to contractors in the sector shows\n            clearly the need for comprehensive road sector management\n            and transparent reporting. The government needs to institute\n            a procurement policy to promote transparency. Development\n            partners need to have better coordination to avoid\n            duplication of technical assistance provision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Highway Sector Investment Program

The\n            Highway Sector Investment Program Project will support this\n            by: 1) reducing vehicle operating costs through maintenance,\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of roads; and 2) ensuring\n            that improvements are sustained by developing and\n            implementing cost recovery policies, building and utilizing\n            indigenous capacity in the public and private sectors, and\n            improving financial management and control. The main\n            components of the project are: 1) maintenance,\n            rehabilitation and reconstruction of the road network; 2)\n            institutional strengthening and capacity

sections indicate that\n            impacts will be fairly benign and limited to the local area\n            where the road works will be carried out.  Severe\n            environmental impacts necessitating resettlement of\n            communities, or causing damage to fragile ecosystems will\n            not occur to a significant extent as a result of the\n            project.  Direct negative impacts will be limited to soil\n            erosion which may be due to improper designs or embandments\n            or side drains; scouring of the landscape due to opening of\n            borrow pits; destruction of vegetation due to clearing\n            right-of-way and a lack of adequate provisions for\n            revegetation; dust, fumes, noise, and vibrations during road\n            work; increased sediment loads in streams and rivers where\n            road crossings occur; and safety hazards created by\n            increased traffic flows and speed.  Secondary impacts from\n            reconstruction will also occur.  Prominent among them is the\n            possibilty of induced development along more accessible road\n            corridors and opening up areas to natural resources to\n            exploitation.  Positive impacts from road improvement\n            activities occur and indeed provide the rationale for this\n            project.  Examples include increase in value of agricultural\n            products due to improved access to markets, enhanced\n            roadside commerce and increased in social mobility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Highway Sector Credit Project : the\n            environmental impact assessment study"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Highway Sector Credit\n
