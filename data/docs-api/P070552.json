Some lessons learned included: the success of\n            the project, even considering the difficulties that emerged\n            along its development, strongly suggests that there is an\n            added value in trying to promote this innovative approach.\n            Moreover, it could be further expanded by including more\n            government agencies, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)\n            with different, complementary profiles, the academic and\n            research, as well as other relevant sectors of the civil\n            society. Even if challenging and difficult to implement,\n            developing a better and wider coordination and integration\n            between government sectors and other non-governmental\n            institutions is becoming an urgent need in face of the\n            growing environmental problems that affect the whole planet.\n            Given its innovative and somewhat experimental nature, it is\n            important to bear in mind that even errors, difficulties and\n            unexpected outcomes resulting from this project provide very\n            useful experience and insight applicable to future projects\n            of similar intersectoral and transversal nature. Problems\n            related with project administration that emerged along this\n            project suggest that as projects become more complex and\n            intersectoral; conflicts of this nature are more likely to\n            arise. Therefore, it will be important in future projects to\n            resource to all the available mechanisms that may contribute\n            to eliminate beforehand as many potential difficulties of\n            this kind as possible. At the time when the project was\n            planned, the State Government of Parana had showed a strong\n            commitment and support for environmental protection.\n            Accordingly, the project was designed under the assumption\n            that the State authorities will support innovative\n            approaches and their effective implementation. After\n            elections in 2002 the new authorities did not embrace the\n            government commitment with the same emphasis. As a result,\n            project implementation suffered both administrative delays\n            and changes in priorities that affected the normal\n            development of planned activities in several components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Parana Biodiversity Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Parana Biodiversity

\"Report and\n            Recommendation - BRAZIL: Parana Biodiversity Project (GEF TF\n            051 007),\" dated September 11, 2006 (Report No.\n            INSP/R2006-0005), and distributed to the Executive Directors\n            and Alternates on September 21, 2006, and contains the\n            Panel's final recommendation on whether the issues\n            raised in the request for inspection warrant an\n            investigation. The report contains the panel's final\n            recommendation on whether an investigation of the issues\n            raised in the request for inspection is warranted. The panel\n            understands the concerns of the requesters for the reasons\n            noted below. The Requesters, the Government and Bank\n            Management agree that the Araucaria Mixed Forest remnants in\n            advanced successional stage are very rare and now reduced to\n            about 60,000 ha or 0.8 percent of their original area,\n            although there are estimates that the exact area may be a\n            little higher or lower. They note that the threat of the\n            complete destruction of these remnants is very high and that\n            the highest priority for biodiversity conservation in the\n            State should be to prevent their destruction. The Panel\n            notes that after the Request for Inspection to the Panel, a\n            number of actions have taken place to address the\n            Requesters' concerns about the implementation of the\n            Project. The Technical Audit, conducted in September and\n            October 2006, proposed increased attention to conserving the\n            remaining remnants of the forests, especially the Araucaria\n            forests. The State Authorities in Parana subsequently\n            prepared an Action Plan to develop additional measures to\n            support biodiversity conservation. In light of the above\n            considerations, the Panel does not recommend an\n            investigation of whether the Bank has complied with its\n            operational policies and procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

The project\n            still has problems concerning the interpretation of the idea\n            of biodiversity. This idea needs to be discussed and to\n            develop a smooth coordination between all institutions and\n            to execute and represent civil society.

The Request was\n            submitted by a non-governmental organization (NGO) based in\n            the State of Parana, Brazil. The Requesters state that the\n            approval of the Project carried \"an unprecedented and\n            very positive expectation that would generate actions\"\n            aimed at preserving the State of Parana's biodiversity.\n            According to the Request, the conservation of the biomass of\n            the Araucaria and the Atlantic Forest is of \"great\n            priority\" in the State of Parana, because same are now\n            reduced to 0.8 percent of its original area. However,\n            according to the Request, \"methodological changes\"\n            made to Project implementation after approval have resulted\n            in a change of Project activities, which will prevent the\n            achievement of the original Project objectives, and will\n            worsen the current situation. Until further notice, all\n            communications with the Requesters in connection with the\n            Request will be sent to the Executive Secretary of the NGO\n            Network of the Atlantic Forest, whom the Requesters\n            appointed as their representative.
