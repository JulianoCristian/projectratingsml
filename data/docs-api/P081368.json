The purpose of\n            the reallocation is to adjust some of the categories in\n            order to meet the Government's ongoing and planned\n            commitments by focusing on priority actions to essentially\n            better cover increasing cost of civil works and grants\n            associated respectively with: (i) the construction of\n            feeder's roads; and (ii) the implementation of village\n            community's development plan. The extension is required\n            to allow the country to complete all project activities.\n            This will in particular provide the time and resources to:\n            (i) complete construction works for the feeder roads; and\n            (ii) allow time for technical support for at least one year\n            to the last village communities benefitting from funding to\n            implement their development plans. The extension will also\n            allow the recipient to make up for the time lost due to\n            2008-2009 political turmoil in Mauritania."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main

socio-economic\n            services, and improved natural resource management\n            practices. The project would achieve its objective through\n            capacity building, and investments in economic, social and\n            environmental sub-projects, implemented by these\n            communities. The capacity building component, reflects the\n            fact that the long-lasting impact of community investments\n            critically depends on: a) the organizational and managerial\n            capacities of villagecommunities to design, and implement\n            effective development plans; and, b) the technical capacity\n            of providers of services to these communities. To this end,\n            four subcomponents will support capacity building:\n            consulting services to design, and implement investment\n            planning, and, training assistance in organization and\n            management capacity building of rural municipalities;\n            capacity building of agricultural services; and, capacity\n            building rural micro-enterprises. The second component\n            supports development of investment funds, through Village\n            Investment Funds, and Rural Communal Road Funds, focused on\n            improving socioeconomic conditions. A third component,\n            project management, monitoring and evaluation, shall provide\n            management, administrative, and financial support during\n            project implementation,
