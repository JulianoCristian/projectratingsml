While not entirely clear as a\n            control issue, this report's authors believe that\n            government agencies emerging from a decade of centralized\n            government, macro-economic instabiity, and a post-conflict\n            environment had varying degrees of difficulty\n            acting/reacting with the technical and administrative\n            agility and skill required by the project. A critical issue\n            beyond Government control was the large number of claims for\n            indemnifications from US citizens , for lands lost during\n            the conflict in 1979 and its aftermath, representing a\n            fiscal and political burden and a huge obstacle for land\n            regularization. Project sustainability is rated likely\n            because of renewed support by IDA, and because follow-up\n            initiatives are building upon this project's\n            achievements. world Bank overall performance was on balance\n            satisfactory but mixed. Borrower peformance overall was\n            satisfactory.Bank requirements, seen by the Borrower as\n            onerous on occasion, nevertheless served an important\n            function of transferring knowledge/technology to borrower\n            agencies concerning the standards, actions, and practices\n            needed to execute complex programs; and its instutional\n            performance--albeit uneven within and between\n            agencies--improved significantly over time. Other lessons\n            learned pertain to monitoring outputs and impacts,\n            collaboration between disparate institutions, and the legal\n            environment for land titling, especially women's land tenure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Agricultural Technology and Land\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Agricultural\n

        Nicaragua in its move towards a market-oriented economy, and\n            to increase and diversify agricultural output and exports,\n            while preserving the country's natural resource base as\n            one of the few viable alternatives to promote sustainable\n            economic growth.  By reactivating land markets, encouraging\n            investment, creating employment opportunities and improving\n            agricultural productivity and the incomes of small and\n            medium farmers through better access to basic agricultural\n            services, the project will help to ameliorate the\n            country's extreme poverty.  The project has two main\n            components.  The agricultural technology component will\n            decentralize agricultural public sector services and support\n            the development of a demand-driven mechanism for private and\n            public research and extension. It will consolidate public\n            research and technology transfer services into a new\n            decentralized Nicaraguan Institute of Agricultural\n            Technology (INTA), incorporating soil conservation and\n            pesticide management as integral parts of the system.\n            Specifically, the project will, through INTA, support\n            programs for:  (a) technology transfer and validation to\n            emphasize crop management research and extension focussed on\n            small and medium farmers, including an artisanal seed\n            program; (b) integrated pest management; (c) soil and water\n            conservation; (d) research grants; and (e) academic studies.\n            In addition, the agricultural technology component will\n            support:  (a) a pesticide management program, as part of\n            establishing a national environmentally sound strategy for\n            pesticide use and management; and (b) a private technical\n            assistance program to help farmer groups contract technical\n            assistance from the private sector.  The land management\n            component will support the design and implementation of a\n            national cadastre, land titling and land registration\n            system.  Specifically, the project will:  (a) streamline\n            administration and improve inter-agency; (b) establish the\n            basis for an efficient national cadastre; (c) strengthen the\n            Public Register at the central and departmental levels; (d)\n            support the issuance of 50,000 land titles, prioritizing\n            beneficiaries by zones; (e) provide technical assistance and\n            equipment to improve field supervision and quality control;\n            and (f) finance studies aimed at establishing the legal\n            administrative and technical groundwork for the future\n            demarcation of the boundaries of indigenous lands and\n            natural reserves."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Agricultural Technology and Land\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Agricultural\n            Technology and Land Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/733083/nicaragua-agricultural-technology-land-management-project","projn":"NI-Agricultural Technology & Land\n            Management -- P007780","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Public & Municipal Finance,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Nicaragua","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961004161633"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural output,Agricultural\n            Technology,Agriculture,division of labor,economic\n            growth,Economic Recovery,economic\n            reform,employment,environmental\n            degradation,equipment,exchange rate,extension,farmers,FISCAL\n            YEAR,government intervention,income,Land Management,land\n            use,marketing,Natural Resources,pollution,private\n            sector,producers,property rights,public sector,public\n            services,quotas,roads,soil degradation,Technical Assistance"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural output,Agricultural\n            Technology,Agriculture,division of labor,economic\n            growth,Economic Recovery,economic\n            reform,employment,environmental\n            degradation,equipment,exchange rate,extension,farmers,FISCAL\n            YEAR,government intervention,income,Land Management,land\n            use,marketing,Natural Resources,pollution,private\n            sector,producers,property rights,public sector,public\n            services,quotas,roads,soil degradation,Technical Assistance"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF025367-PHRD-LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF023450-CANADIAN CONSULTANT TF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF034543-LATIN AMERICA,- PUBLIC SECTOR\n            MODERNIZATION (HONDURAS, VENEZUELA ),TF034394-NICARAGUA - AGRICULTURAL\n            TECHNOLOGY & LAND MGMT PROJECT,TF031949-NICARAGUA - AGRICULTURE,TF029522-PHRD-LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT","repnb":"P6071"},"734631":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1993/06/734631/nicaragua-agricultural-technology-land-management-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1993/06/734631/nicaragua-agricultural-technology-land-management-project","new_url":"1993/06/734631/nicaragua-agricultural-technology-land-management-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/06/29/000009265_3961004161221/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/06/29/000009265_3961004161221/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"2536","docdt":"1993-06-29T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1993-06-29T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Agricultural Technology and\n            Land Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objective of the Agricultural\n            Technology and Land Management Project is to assist\n            Nicaragua in its move towards a market-oriented economy, and\n            to increase and diversify agricultural output and exports,\n            while preserving the country's natural resource base as\n            one of the few viable alternatives to promote sustainable\n            economic growth.
