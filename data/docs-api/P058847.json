Some lessons learned included:\n            during project implementation, Xinjiang Communications\n            Department (XCD) increased its funding for road maintenance,\n            and introduced some improvement in management. The condition\n            of Xinjiang's road network at the end of the project\n            showed to be significant better than at the start. However,\n            during the same period, XCD, with its own funds, carried out\n            a substantial program of improvements of the Xinjiang's\n            road network, which likely had a significant impact on the\n            condition of the network. XCD sought to maximize the impact\n            of the training by requiring trainees to evaluate the\n            various training sessions and by disseminating inside the\n            agency the knowledge received by the trainees. Past\n            experience has shown that a good training mix should include\n            both domestic and foreign training. Designers generally pay\n            less attention to the design of local roads, limiting their\n            efforts to a sketchy design much less accurate than the one\n            of the expressway, thinking these local roads are less\n            important. Experience showed that could lead to major\n            problems at implementation stage, particularly for the roads\n            in difficult topography and geology. A recurrent problem in\n            the four-lane sections of Kuitun-Sailimuhu Highway (KSH)\n            road is the dangerous crossing at at-grade intersections."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Third

To meet its development\n            objective, the components will: 1) include the construction\n            of a four lane expressway, and additional two lanes in the\n            Kuitun-SailimuHu Highway, as well as upgrading the existing\n            two lane roads to Class 1 (and/or Class 2) standard,\n            combining new, and existing alignments. An eighty percent of\n            the KuiSai highway will use the existing alignment, while\n            new alignments will mostly serve as bypasses to urbanized\n            areas in Wusu, and Jinghe; 2) connect primary local roads,\n            and townships to the provincial, and national highway\n            system, to ensure access to rural areas, and poor counties.\n            The component will entail a four-year rehabilitation\n            program, implemented under a programmatic approach; and, 3)\n            strengthen institutional capacity, by providing training\n            assistance, and specialized equipment, to address sector\n            issues, key in preparing future sector reforms.

It will undergo major\n            construction, alignment, and upgrading. During the designing\n            period, the design of sewage treatment in stations and\n            service areas should guarantee the life sewage and\n            industrial wastewater within disposal standard. The highway\n            should avoid running through residential districts in\n            cities/towns, and the alignment should be away from schools\n            and hospitals. The highway should occupy as little\n            farmlands, grasslands, and woods as possible. Trees removed\n            will be replanted. During construction, sewage from the\n            construction camps can be led into available drainage\n            network. Wastewater with oil should be collected and stored\n            in a pond for eventual drying up. Oil or chemical pollutants\n            and waste materials will be disposed of in accordance with\n            regulations. Water should be sprayed to avoid dust. The new\n            construction and traffic access roads should be paved with\n            asphalt. Noise impacts will be reduced by locating\n            constructions far away from protected areas. No borrow pits\n            are allowed in the wind gap and farmlands. Sites should be\n            restored after construction. During operation, enclosing\n            walls will be built to reduce noise levels.
