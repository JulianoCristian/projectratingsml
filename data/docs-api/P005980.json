Lessons learned from the project: A few\n            features that are closely linked to successful\n            implementation of the project include the project readiness\n            and good quality of designs, encourage borrower commitment\n            to the project objectives even during a crisis, effort\n            dedicated to efficient coordination and supervision with the\n            project coordination unit. A sound and permanent system of\n            road financing at the provincial level through a combination\n            of user fees combined with financial assistance from the\n            central government are required to better plan, program and\n            implement road infrastructure management. Unforeseen delays\n            in the Bank and borrower administrative procedures between\n            project negotiation and loan effectiveness required a longer\n            gestation period far beyond regular scheduling.\n            Implementation of institutional strengthening program\n            required better defined binding agreements between the\n            borrower and the Bank. Close assessment of the achievements\n            of this project show the need to complement them through\n            more results oriented institutional and financial efforts of\n            provincial authorities.
