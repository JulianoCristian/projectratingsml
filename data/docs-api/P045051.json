Successful implementation of TIs required\n            identification of high risk groups and coverage gaps through\n            comprehensive micro-site mapping that is repeated\n            periodically. Participatory mapping involving\n            community-based organizations has been a best practice.\n            Ensuring that baseline data is available and on record is\n            crucial and project preparation teams need to ensure that\n            the necessary technical assistance as well as time is made\n            available for this purpose. The need for a full contingent\n            of trained and skilled staff in key posts.

To promote\n            nationwide efforts, the project set up AIDS control offices\n            in 32 states and union territories. It also helped establish\n            information, education, and communication (IEC) program,\n            exploiting media and traditional communications channels\n            such as folk music, festivals, awareness campaigns, and\n            elephant parades to highlight the risks of HIV or AIDS.\n            Building on initial phases of HIV or AIDS work, India now\n            faces the challenge of quickly and effectively implementing\n            programs in a number of states.
