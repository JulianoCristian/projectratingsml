Lessons\n            learned: 1) a \"learning by doing\" approach is an\n            effective method for developing a flexible, demand driven\n            project in a transition economy while providing for\n            immediate and visible results. The approach does not\n            compromise project quality; on the contrary, it results in\n            more meaningful project preparation and provides for\n            built-in project adaptability to a changing environment; (b)\n            the participation of future borrowers in the design of a\n            credit program can lead to greater ownership and reduced\n            risk. In Albania, village intermediation, using\n            village-level solidarity, can very effectively limit the\n            risk of small credit; and (c) the pilot project's\n            bottom-up approach for rural infrastructure rehabilitation\n            created some competition and bureaucratic rivalries with the\n            central government ministries that advocate and pursue a\n            top-down approach. Some ministries appeared to be resentful\n            of Albanian Development Fund (ADF's) large donor\n            budget, its low costs for rural works, and its flexibility\n            and quickness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Rural Poverty\n            Alleviation Pilot Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/06/733495/albania-rural-poverty-alleviation-pilot-project","projn":"AL-Rural Poverty Alleviation Project -- P008264","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Housing Finance,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961219130818"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Other social services,General transportation sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agriculture,animal\n            health,appropriate technology,autonomy,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,banking system,Board of Trustees,budget\n            deficit,cash flow,central planning,command economy,Credit\n            Agreement,decision making,devaluation,development\n            assistance,development policies,disbursement,economic\n            development,economic growth,effective\n            use,employment,entrepreneurship,EXCHANGE\n            RATES,expenditures,farmers,farms,financier,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            security,IFAD,Imports,income,inflation,innovation,interest\n            rate,International Fund for Agricultural\n            Development,irrigation,Islamic Development\n            Bank,livestock,local government,local governments,"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agriculture,animal\n            health,appropriate technology,autonomy,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,banking system,Board of Trustees,budget\n            deficit,cash flow,central planning,command economy,Credit\n            Agreement,decision making,devaluation,development\n            assistance,development policies,disbursement,economic\n            development,economic growth,effective\n            use,employment,entrepreneurship,EXCHANGE\n            RATES,expenditures,farmers,farms,financier,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            security,IFAD,Imports,income,inflation,innovation,interest\n            rate,International Fund for Agricultural\n            Development,irrigation,Islamic Development\n            Bank,livestock,local government,local governments,"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF027978-SECONDMENT OF MR.
