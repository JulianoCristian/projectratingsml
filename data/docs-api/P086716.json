Some lessons\n            learned includes: keeping project design relatively simple\n            when operating in countries with complex environments,\n            limited capacity, and a weak country implementation record.\n            Making the stability of project management or coordination\n            units a covenant can be an effective means of avoiding\n            adverse consequences of political interference in complex\n            policy environments. While acquisition and development of\n            geo-data (geological, geo-physical, magnetic, etc.) is\n            instrumental in attracting investors, there is a parallel\n            demand for designing adequate systems and modalities for\n            dissemination (and sale) of the data to a wide international\n            audience. Web-based solutions have proven most efficient but\n            constrained by national security concerns and limited\n            band-with in developing countries; when the project is\n            supporting the start up and initial operating expenses of\n            new institutions, such as the Nigeria Institute of Mining\n            and Geosciences or the Mining Cadastre Office, it is\n            important to build a plan for phasing out subsidies for\n            operating expenses into project design. The importance of\n            government commitment to budgeting sufficient funds to cover\n            recurrent cost in order to sustain project investments\n            beyond the project closing date; the necessity to approach\n            mining sector development from different interrelated\n            angles, such as looking to reform, in parallel, the mining\n            sector's regulatory framework and institutional set up;\n            capacity building of the lead agency to improve governance;\n            increase transparency through computerization of the mining\n            cadastre; promote the mineral sector through high quality\n            data and integrated data management; and to redress adverse\n            environmental, social and economic conditions typically\n            associated with informal mining by incentivizing the\n            legalization of and giving a 'leg up out of\n            poverty' to small scale

objective of the\n            Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project for\n            Nigeria is to assist the borrower in the implementation of a\n            strategy designed to: (i) improve governance and technical\n            capacity in the solid minerals sector to enable the\n            sustainable management of mineral resources; and (ii)\n            establish a basis for poverty reduction and rural economic\n            renewal in selected areas of the territory of the borrower\n            via the development of non-farm income-generating\n            opportunities through artisanal and small-scale mining via\n            diversification away from oil sources of income. The\n            International Development Association (IDA) credit in the\n            amount of SDR 80.1 million (US$120 million equivalent) was\n            approved by the Board on December 14, 2004, and became\n            effective on April 25, 2005. Current closing date (after an\n            extension granted on November 24, 2009) is May 30, 2012. The\n            original project is expected to be fully disbursed by its\n            current closing date. The project has been consistently\n            rated satisfactory. The project is an important element of\n            the Government of Nigeria's strategy to diversify its\n            economy away from petroleum. The project has generated\n            substantial results, including establishment of a regulatory\n            framework and an institutional structure for a sector which\n            was, in the beginning of the project, generally informal and\n            unregulated. Some of the important achievements to-date\n            include: (i) airborne geophysical surveys of the entire\n            country have been completed; (ii) the modern transparent\n            mining cadastre system is now in place and operational;\n            (iii) modern mining law and regulations are now in place,\n            fiscal regime for mining is updated and competitive; (iv) to\n            train the next generation of Nigerian leaders for the mining\n            sector, the project supported re-opening and upgrading of\n            the Nigerian Institute for Mining and Geosciences (NIMG) as\n            well as rolling out accounting and finance courses for\n            mining sector personnel across colleges and universities in\n            Nigeria; (v) the small grants program for artisanal and\n            community based miners has supported almost 300 projects and\n            had improved the productivity, safety and working\n            conditions, and livelihoods of the beneficiaries; (vi) the\n            project assisted in development of new mineral product lines\n            including gemstones and dimension stone. Significant\n            progress has been made to put Nigeria on the map in respect\n            of the former and to develop local commercial and\n            residential construction markets for the latter."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Sustainable Management\n            of Mineral Resources Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/05/16262744/nigeria-sustainable-management-mineral-resources-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"NG-Sustainable Management Of Mineral\n            Resources -- P086716","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Debt Markets,Labor Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120510010229"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Vocational training,Other social services,Mining and other extractive,Micro- and SME finance","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, Bank financing, beneficiaries,\n            budget allocation, Cadastre, capacity building, dimension\n            stone, Disbursements, equipment, expenditures, federal\n            budget, gemstones, Geological Survey, geophysical surveys,\n            implementation period, International Development, IP,\n            mineral investment, mineral product, MINERAL RESOURCES,\n            Mines, mining cadastre system, mining law, mining law and\n            regulations, mining sector, MMSD, next generation,\n            procurement, productivity, regulatory framework,\n            Resettlement, RESULTS, safety, Steel, SUSTAINABLE\n            MANAGEMENT, transparent mining cadastre, working conditions"}},"owner":"Oil, Gas and Mining (SEGOM)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"68656"},"16262748":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/05/16262748/nigeria-sustainable-management-mineral-resources-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/05/16262748/nigeria-sustainable-management-mineral-resources-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","new_url":"2012/05/16262748/nigeria-sustainable-management-mineral-resources-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","disclosure_date":"2012-05-10T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-05-10T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-05-10T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/05/10/000386194_20120510010517/Rendered/INDEX/686560PJPR0P080ucturing0Data0sheet.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/05/10/000386194_20120510010517/Rendered/PDF/686560PJPR0P080ucturing0Data0sheet.pdf","credit_no":"Q431;4012","docdt":"2012-05-08T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2012-05-10T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Sustainable Management of Mineral\n            Resources Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the\n            Sustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project for\n            Nigeria is to assist the borrower in the implementation of a\n            strategy designed to: (i) improve governance and technical\n            capacity in the solid minerals sector to enable the\n            sustainable management of mineral resources; and (ii)\n            establish a basis for poverty reduction and rural economic\n            renewal in selected areas of the territory of the borrower\n            via the development of non-farm income-generating\n            opportunities through artisanal and small-scale mining via\n            diversification away from oil sources of income.

Some of the important achievements to-date\n            include: (i) airborne geophysical surveys of the entire\n            country have been completed; (ii) the modern transparent\n            mining cadastre system is now in place and operational;\n            (iii) modern mining law and regulations are now in place,\n            fiscal regime for mining is updated and competitive; (iv) to\n            train the next generation of Nigerian leaders for the mining\n            sector, the project supported re-opening and upgrading of\n            the Nigerian Institute for Mining and Geosciences (NIMG) as\n            well as rolling out accounting and finance courses for\n            mining sector personnel across colleges and universities in\n            Nigeria; (v) the small grants program for artisanal and\n            community based miners has supported almost 300 projects and\n            had improved the productivity, safety and working\n            conditions, and livelihoods of the beneficiaries; (vi) the\n            project assisted in development of new mineral product lines\n            including gemstones and dimension stone. Significant\n            progress has been made to put Nigeria on the map in respect\n            of the former and to develop local commercial and\n            residential construction markets for the latter."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria -
