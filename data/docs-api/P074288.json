Decentralized Rural\n            Electrification Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Decentralized Rural\n            Electrification Project (PERD) for Guinea were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: projects in which private financial\n            institutions are expected to play a significant role during\n            implementation should include a detailed assessment with\n            potential interested commercial banks about the conditions\n            under which they are expected to perform, aligning the\n            incentives of the institutions with those of the project.\n            Specifically, the fees for the commercial bank and their\n            relation with loan recovery should be identified and agreed,\n            at least in regard to key aspects, during preparation. In\n            future similar operations, an incentive related to loan\n            recovery should be established and prioritized in the\n            contract with the commercial bank. The PERD is a good\n            example of blending equity, loans, and subsidies to achieve\n            effective electrification in remote rural areas. The actual\n            proportions of these inputs must be adapted to specific\n            circumstances. During PERD execution it came to light that\n            the proportion of loan plus subsidy required was higher than\n            initially estimated, and this will have signaled the need to\n            track loan payback rates more closely to ensure\n            sustainability of the approach. In recent years, the\n            Renewable Energy Technologies, or RET 'learning\n            curve' has been high, costs have been reduced\n            dramatically, and several examples in Sub-Saharan Africa\n            have become a reality. As financing schemes have started to\n            prove successful and an enabling environment is created, a\n            similar approach could be replicated in Guinea but focusing\n            on RETs. However, as these technologies are not yet commonly\n            used, more preparatory work would need to be carried out."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Decentralized Rural Electrification
