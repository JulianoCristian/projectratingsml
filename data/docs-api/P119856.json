Some lessons\n            learned included: the effectiveness of the single-tranche\n            operations is enhanced by a design that balances addressing\n            short-term challenges with concern for mid-term\n            sustainability. The debt restructuring made it possible for\n            banks to write down foreign debts by about US$11 billion.\n            The financial community considers these deals to be a fair\n            distribution of losses between unsecured foreign creditors\n            and the government, which spent US$10 billion to support the\n            banking sector in 2008-2009. The debt restructuring also\n            reduce banking sector external indebtedness by about a\n            third, from US$30 billion at the end of 2009 to about US$20\n            billion currently. A well-designed DPL can send a powerful\n            signal to the international community about the capacity and\n            commitment of the authorities to mitigate the impact of a\n            crisis. The DPL came at a point critical for Kazakhstan,\n            which had been hit by successive crises that required\n            considerable expenditures. The operation translated the\n            trust of the Bank in the commitment and capacity of the\n            authorities into a clear statement to the international\n            community that Kazakhstan could surmount the crises and look\n            forward to renewed growth and stability over the medium term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Development Policy Loan (DPL)

measures by the Government of Kazakhstan to foster\n            economic growth and protect living standards to be supported\n            by a Development Policy Loan (DPL) in the amount of USD 1\n            billion. In response to external shocks beginning in August\n            2007, the Government embarked on a program combining a\n            fiscal stimulus and policy reforms in 2008, which includes\n            measures supported by this operation in the following two\n            areas: (i) strengthening public resource management, in\n            particular the rules for the National (oil) Fund (NF) and\n            budgetary management at national and local levels, and (ii)\n            strengthening the financial sector and addressing its\n            vulnerabilities. These prior actions are part and parcel of\n            the Government's medium term reform program, and have\n            been the subject of joint analytical work, brain-storming\n            and policy dialogue with the Bank. They are also\n            prerequisites for the next steps in the ongoing reform\n            process. Restoring and sustaining confidence and stability\n            in the financial sector is essential for the recovery of\n            credit flows to private firms, and increasing efficiency of\n            public spending is important for enhancing the impact of the\n            continuing fiscal stimulus. Together, they lay the basis for\n            other policies to advance diversification and non-oil growth\n            in Kazakhstan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Development Policy Loan
