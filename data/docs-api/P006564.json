There are four key\n            lessons derived from these projects: 1) It is necessary to\n            create an enabling environment for .the financial\n            sustainability of urban transport operations; one that\n            achieves a balance between being market-oriented but, at the\n            same time, takes into account the urban environment and\n            affordability issues. It is also important to define a fare\n            policy that squarely faces the issues of cost recovery\n            including, transparent passenger subsidies for the poor and\n            funding mechanisms to cover operating deficits. 2) The\n            decentralization of urban rail systems from the federal to\n            the state or a lower level of government is desirable\n            because it brings the operator closer to the users, thus\n            allowing for the service to be more responsive to user needs\n            and wishes. Decentralization is also likely to facilitate\n            integration with other transport modes since there will be\n            fewer levels of government that have to be in agreement with\n            tariff and subsidy policies. 3) Conflicts among government\n            institutions, political parties, as well as worker and\n            private sector lobbies can be a major source of disruption\n            in the execution of large urban transport projects. The Bank\n            should be prepared to assist in the mobilization of\n            negotiating skills for conflict resolution should they be\n            needed. 4) The time it takes to rehabilitate rolling stock\n            should not be underestimated. Both projects show that the\n            private firms responsible for delivery of the rehabilitated\n            trains have experienced serious technical, administrative\n            and financial problems that had to be resolved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
