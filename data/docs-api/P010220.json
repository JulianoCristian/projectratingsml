The four projects were\n            a successful part of the early implementation of the RAP\n            strategy. However, they drifted away from this strategy and\n            did not achieve their projected results and impact. While\n            the projects had some worthwhile and widespread poverty\n            alleviation impact, they also provided large transfers of\n            public resources to some of the rural elite. The\n            institutional outcomes of the projects were not up to\n            expectations. While the sustainability of the improvements\n            made to watercourses under the projects is not in doubt, the\n            method of financing adopted, with its heavy reliance on\n            external aid and subsidies, is not sustainable. Even so, the\n            four projects were generally successful in achieving their\n            main physical objectives but the greater institutional and\n            social problems affecting system performance remain and may\n            have increased. Two major lessons can be learned from these\n            projects. First, there is a need for disaggregated\n            investment packages which are tailored closely to the\n            specific physical, social, and economic characteristics of\n            the very different areas within the system instead of broad\n            scale national projects. Lastly, there is a need for an\n            improved and independent analytical base on water sector\n            issues, routinely maintained in current status rather than\n            being periodically updated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - On-Farm and Command Water\n            Management and Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - On-Farm and Command\n            Water Management and Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/06/441891/pakistan-on-farm-command-water-management-irrigation-systems-rehabilitation-projects","projn":"PK-On Farm Water Manage -- P010160,PK-Water Management II -- P010220,PK-Command Water Manage -- P010202,PK-Irrig.

Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, amendment of the DCA to open four provincial\n            Special Accounts in the early stage of the project\n            facilitated the flow of funds and expedited implementation.\n            Second, application of more rigid criteria for both\n            selection of watercourses to be renovated and sections to be\n            lined is needed in order to avoid renovation. Third, greater\n            attention should be paid to WUAs to ensure that they can\n            function as intended. Fourth, use of expatriate consultants\n            should be limited to specializations for which expertise is\n            not readily available locally. Fifth, greater attention must\n            be paid to establishing an effective M & E system.\n            Finally, the Borrower should proceed with caution in\n            implementing the third OFWM project and not underestimate\n            the experience gained from the current project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
