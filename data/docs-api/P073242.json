Some lessons learned included:\n            energy efficiency improvements in multi-apartment buildings\n            of the Soviet era are a challenging undertaking that\n            requires collective decision making by homeowners. It takes\n            a concerted effort and a long-term partnership between the\n            government and the private sector to successfully promote\n            energy efficiency in these buildings. Key ingredients will\n            be: information campaigns, support to Homeowners'\n            Association (HOA) creation and access to preferential,\n            long-tenor loans and/or subsidies. Under the Vilnius City\n            Municipality (VCM) implemented components, the project has\n            demonstrated a model of a municipal-level facility capable\n            of operating in a commercially oriented fashion to finance\n            residential energy efficiency. Creating the incentives for\n            commercial banks to enter the scheme is the key to scaling\n            up a program using such a facility. However, the project\n            also demonstrated that building envelope investments remain\n            costly, and energy savings alone may not be sufficient to\n            generate a reasonable economic payback on them. For a\n            national-level housing renovation program to be successful,\n            it will be necessary to find ways to reduce the capital\n            costs of building renovations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lithuania - Vilnius Heat Demand Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lithuania - Vilnius Heat Demand\n            Management

- Vilnius District Heating Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The principal objectives of the project\n            were to reduce the cost of heat supply; improve the quality\n            of supply, both in terms of reliability of supply and\n            timeliness of customer responsiveness; increase tax yields\n            to the Government; and support commercial viability through\n            privatization. The Vilnius District Heating Company had\n            suffered financially over the decade prior to project\n            preparation, resulting in loss of market share of an\n            environmentally prudent form of heat supply by using waste\n            heat from power plants. The project was designed to stop the\n            worsening financial performance of the company and physical\n            deterioration of the network and support heat supply in a\n            sustainable manner. Based on Bank experience in preparing\n            for concession arrangements in other countries (particularly\n            for water supply in Asia and Latin America) it was expected\n            that it would take at least two years to engage the private\n            sector participation. The project was designed to ensure\n            that the heating system and the company would not\n            deteriorate further during that time period and would fund\n            high priority investments that would be attractive to any\n            future investor. However, the Municipality of Vilnius was\n            able to attract private investment much faster than had been\n            the experience in other countries. As a result, a concession\n            arrangement was finalized within six months after Board\n            presentation, much less than the two years originally\n            expected. Although the winning bidder had identified\n            investments that were consistent with the Bank-funded\n            project, the loan was not signed. The Government did not\n            want to use its limited guarantee capacity for private\n            projects and the bidder was able to arrange alternate\n            financing on attractive terms and without having to follow\n            Bank procurement procedures.  Despite the fact that the loan\n            was never signed and was, at the request of the guarantor,\n            withdrawn in March 2003, the developmental impact of the\n            Bank intervention is expected to be fully met."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lithuania - Vilnius District Heating Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lithuania - Vilnius District\n            Heating

improving the quality\n            of district heating supply, while supporting the commercial\n            viability, and possible privatization of the Vilnius\n            District Heating Company (VDHC). The Project will focus\n            district heating investments in areas where VDHC has a\n            competitive advantage as well as related energy efficiency\n            investments in households. A fundamental design change in\n            heat supply would be facilitated by investments in\n            substations designed to improve the quality of district\n            heating supply by enabling temperature control by the\n            consumer. The Project will also support demand-side\n            investments to enable decreases in heat losses and further\n            improvements in temperature control. Following are some of\n            the negative impacts and mitigating measures. Due to\n            constructions there will be some noise, dust, disposal of\n            solid materials, and water leakage.

The\n            objective of the Project is to reduce the emissions of\n            greenhouse gases from the Vilnius District Heating System by\n            reducing barriers, and implementing, financially sustainable\n            and replicable energy efficiency investments in the\n            residential sector of the Vilnius City. This would be\n            achieved by: co-financing demand management programs which\n            would demonstrate the benefits of automatic, and\n            consumer-controlled use of heat in homes, and\n            consumption-based billing at the apartment level; a limited\n            grant (or capital subsidy) financing from the GEF, that\n            would cover the cost of down-payments (connection fees) for\n            Apartment Level Demand Side Management equipment -\n            particularly, for low-income customers. A commercially\n            sustainable (revolving) financial facility will be created -\n            ECP Commercial Fund - to support the implementation of\n            investments aimed at reducing heat losses from the\n            City's housing stock. The facility would provide both\n            financing, and technical assistance for such investments,\n            mobilizing additional financing from commercial sources as\n            appropriate. Moreover, monitoring, evaluation, and\n            information dissemination activities will be implemented,\n            aimed at facilitating the replication of the Project's experience."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vilnius Heat Demand Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vilnius Heat Demand Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2355576/vilnius-heat-demand-management-project","projn":"LT-Vilnius Heat Demand Management Gef\n            Project -- P073242","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Urban Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy Conservation & Efficiency","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Lithuania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20030522100245"},"subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"audits,Boilers,capacity\n            building,cities,Climate Change,cogeneration\n            systems,commercial energy,commercial energy use,common\n            property,competitive markets,consumption of energy,Cost\n            Analysis,Cost Benefit Analysis,Cost-Effectiveness\n            Analysis,District heating,district heating sector,district\n            heating system,District heating systems,DSM,economic\n            circumstances,economic growth,electricity,emissions,Energy\n            Conservation,Energy consumption,Energy Efficiency,Energy\n            Efficiency Finance,energy efficiency improvements,energy\n            efficiency market,energy management,energy needs,energy\n            policy,energy resources,energy saving,energy savings,energy\n            sector,Energy service,Energy service company,Environmental\n            Benefits,ESCO,Exchange Rate,expenditures,GEF,GLOBAL\n            ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY,Greenhouse\n            gases,grid,Heat,heat recovery,heating\n            systems,housing,imports,income,insulation,lighting,low-income\n            consumers,low-income households,Municipal\n            governance,oil,Operating Costs,pipes,power,power factor\n            correction,Power Plants,primary energy,sustainable\n            development,sustainable Energy,temperature,temperature\n            control,transaction costs,valves"},"1":{"cdata!":"audits,Boilers,capacity\n            building,cities,Climate Change,cogeneration\n            systems,commercial energy,commercial energy use,common\n            property,competitive markets,consumption of energy,Cost\n            Analysis,Cost Benefit Analysis,Cost-Effectiveness\n            Analysis,District heating,district heating sector,district\n            heating system,District heating systems,DSM,economic\n            circumstances,economic growth,electricity,emissions,Energy\n            Conservation,Energy consumption,Energy Efficiency,Energy\n            Efficiency Finance,energy efficiency improvements,energy\n            efficiency market,energy management,energy needs,energy\n            policy,energy resources,energy saving,energy savings,energy\n            sector,Energy service,Energy service company,Environmental\n            Benefits,ESCO,Exchange Rate,expenditures,GEF,GLOBAL\n            ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY,Greenhouse\n            gases,grid,Heat,heat recovery,heating\n            systems,housing,imports,income,insulation,lighting,low-income\n            consumers,low-income households,Municipal\n            governance,oil,Operating Costs,pipes,power,power factor\n            correction,Power Plants,primary energy,sustainable\n            development,sustainable Energy,temperature,temperature\n            control,transaction costs,valves"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF050314-GEF2 FSP-LITHUANIA:VILNIAUS\n            ENERGIA;VILNIAUS HEAT DEMAND MANAGEMENT PRO,TF052278-GEF2 FSP-LITHUANIA:VILINIUS\n            CITY MUNICIPALITY; VILINIUS HEAT DEMAND MAN","repnb":"25910"},"facets":{}}}
