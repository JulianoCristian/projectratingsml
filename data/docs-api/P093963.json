Some lessons learned included:\n            in general, the improvement of accessibility and mobility\n            should be measured by corridor traffic and travel time. At\n            appraisal, the project's development objectives (PDO)\n            monitoring was not well arranged. During implementation, the\n            Guiyang project management office (GPMO) monitored the\n            indicators inconsistently with some initial delays:\n            different approaches were used (variability in sampling\n            method) from one report to another and traffic counts were\n            not collected and processed professionally. Approval and\n            provision of additional funding for the project after\n            restructuring took time, which contributed to implementation\n            delays.
