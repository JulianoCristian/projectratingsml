Some\n            lessons learned included: decentralization to the district\n            level has the potential to improve service delivery, but it\n            needs to be anchored within a strong institutional framework\n            accompanied by capacity building (including on fiduciary\n            issues) to improve the autonomy of districts and enable them\n            to plan, budget, and better manage their programs. At the\n            same time, sufficient attention should be given to national\n            level policy dialogue in order to ensure continuous support\n            and commitment to the decentralization agenda. In a\n            challenging political environment, sufficient attention\n            needs to be given during project design to find the right\n            balance between innovation for impact and preconditions for\n            reform. Preferably, for complex and innovative reforms like\n            those involving decentralization and fiscal transfers, it is\n            important to establish legal, policy and institutional\n            frameworks including implementation arrangements at all\n            levels and/or to plan to develop such capacity to carry out\n            the assigned responsibilities effectively. It may be\n            necessary that some progress take place on key aspects of\n            reform during project design and before project\n            effectiveness to ensure sufficient political commitment and\n            momentum from the government. Projects need good monitoring\n            and evaluation systems with clear and measurable indicators,\n            which are clearly defined during design of the project and\n            institutionalized to be able to systematically monitor\n            project implementation over time. Given the long history of\n            similar lessons from previous operations in health, there is\n            a clear need for simple, well-designed monitoring frameworks\n            that are owned by the government and implementable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Decentralized Reproductive Health\n            and HIV/AIDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Decentralized\n

MTEF is essentially a\n            response to past budget failures in which budgeting was\n            reduced to a listing of 'wish-list' activities\n            that focused on 'needs' rather than 'funds\n            availability' causing undue expansion in the public\n            sector.  Moreover, government policymaking, planning, and\n            budgeting took place independently of each other such that\n            the budgetary implications of policies and programs were\n            rarely taken into explicit account.  Due to these factors,\n            many developing countries experienced inexorable growth in\n            government projects and in civil service employment,\n            resulting in little leeway for the funding of other\n            recurrent costs and in ensuring the sustainability of\n            investments. MTEF attempts to correct these budgetary\n            distortions by providing a 3 to 5 year framework for the\n            funding of priority expenditures under a given and\n            predictable budget constraint, that is, subject to the\n            availability of funds that are within the manageable\n            interest of the government (budgetary funds, extra-budgetary\n            funds such as user fees, and donor resources).  An MTEF\n            exercise has three related objectives are to improve\n            government and donors' allocation and spending of\n            resources to identified priorities within the sector, to\n            increase government and donors' commitment to the\n            stated policy and to funding predictability, and to provide\n            line ministries with a solid budget constraint that allows\n            them to 'contract' with lower level units on the\n            basis of a predictable budget. This report reviews the\n            status of the Government of Kenya's (GoK) initiative to\n            develop an MTEF for the health sector.  It identifies\n            institutional and technical constraints in the MTEF process,\n            provides recommendations for expediting and improving it,\n            and attempts to share lessons learned from other East\n            African countries that are going through similar budgetary\n            reform exercises. This report reiterates the importance of\n            formulating the MTEF firstly in the context of GoK's\n            stated goal of improving economic governance.  The Ministry\n            of Finance (MoF) views the MTEF as an important instrument\n            for instilling fiscal discipline and improving expenditure\n            management at the macro level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya's medium term expenditure\n            framework in the health sector : missed opportunities,\n            actions for revival, and lessons from
