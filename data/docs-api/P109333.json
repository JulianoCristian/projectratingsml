Some lessons learned includes:\n            complex program design: programs/projects with many\n            components are always difficult for the country to\n            implement, particularly when the operation is the first in\n            the sector. ETSIP included activities aiming at improving\n            all levels and sectors of education, from early child\n            education to the tertiary level, from adult education and\n            lifelong learning to vocational training. Stakeholder\n            engagement: when engaging in a country with little, or no,\n            experience in dealing with the bank, sufficient, time should\n            be spent in ensuring that all stakeholders understand and\n            agree on what the cooperation entails (in terms of\n            processes, mutual responsibilities and obligations, and\n            financial support conditionality's). The lack of prior\n            analysis of the implementation capacity of Ministry of\n            Education (MOE) was a noticeable hindrance to a smooth\n            execution of the program activities. The design of the\n            program did not take in sufficient consideration the\n            execution capacity of the implementers. It also did not into\n            account the time necessary for the government to adopt\n            important policy measures. Project development objective\n            indicators need to be specified so that the key indicators\n            can be followed up over time. Additionally, if new\n            indicators are introduced to measure the impact of specific\n            interventions, it should be ensured that the relevant unit\n            in the ministry is fully conversant with the techniques of\n            collecting those indicators. Continuous implementation\n            support: there should be continuity in assisting the\n            implementation of programs/projects. Long gaps in the timing\n            of assistance inputs cause slow-downs in execution, and the\n            risk of distortions in the attainment of intermediate\n            objectives and outputs as compared to the original ones.\n            Considerations for working with development partners:\n            mobilization of development partners around a program is not\n            the end goal of partnerships but a continuous fostering of\n            relationships and transparent interactions is integral for\n            the success and efficiency of the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Namibia - First Education and Training\n            Sector Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Namibia - First Education and\n            Training
