Some lessons\n            learned included: Flexible planning and implementation were\n            vital to EDRP's success, and are important to\n            successful demobilization and reintegration programs.\n            Innovative use of emergency financing arrangement allowed\n            for timely, rapid and flexible availability of financing.\n            Decentralized management and decision-making was another\n            feature of EDRP's success and an experience worthy of\n            emulation in project management in large countries such as\n            Ethiopia. The disbursement of cash payments only after\n            veterans return to their communities of settlement reduced\n            potential loss, theft or wastage of this resource before\n            veterans settlement. Additional counseling on the investment\n            of veterans cash grants could have enhanced their use of\n            these resources, as suggested by a number of local\n            government officials and veterans.

In\n            general, the emergency rehabilitation interventions are not\n            expected to cause unintended or negative social and economic\n            impacts. They instead are expected to have added economic\n            and social values for the beneficiaries and the local\n            communities. The war-affected Internally displaced People\n            (IDPs) in Tigray have moved to neighboring woredas and no\n            social problems were observed as a result of the\n            displacement. However, where the woredas and tabias have\n            moved to, had limited social services, and economic\n            opportunities before displacement, and the displacement has\n            increased the burden on the host community. Similarly, in\n            Afar, the livestock owners have moved to other woredas\n            and/or kebels within same woredas which are relatively\n            landmine free. Deportees are concentrating in urban centers\n            of Tigray, Afar and Amhara Regions. They have been well\n            integrated with the communities sharing the scarce social\n            services and economic opportunities in the respective urban\n            centers. The Emergency Recovery Program (ERP) interventions\n            do not involve involuntary settlement of beneficiaries. The\n            plan is that the IDPs in both regions will eventually return\n            to their origins and continue their usual productive\n            economic lives. There could still be some problems\n            associated with the landmines, especially in some of the\n            woredas and tabias, and this calls for speeding up of the\n            de-mining process. In addition, IDPs displaced from the\n            disputable areas may face a problem to return and the peace\n            and reconciliation program will be also encouraged for the\n            IDPs
