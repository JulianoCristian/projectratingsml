- Programmatic Social Reform Loan (02)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the Programmatic Social\n            Reform Loan (02) for Peru were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest and, the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned include: the number of specific components,\n            activities, conditions and implementing agencies\n            incorporated into an operation should be bounded by and\n            prioritized within the coordinating and supervision\n            capacities of the Bank and the Borrower. The designation of\n            a subset of these elements as benchmarks and triggers for\n            follow-up operations may help to specify priorities but does\n            not significantly lighten coordinating and monitoring\n            responsibilities, so long as the non-highlighted objectives\n            are also to be taken seriously. The Pension Reform\n            Adjustment Loan (PSAL) instrument, designed as a series of\n            one-tranche loans, is useful for giving flexibility to\n            adjust program details over time, and thus, assures\n            continuity of support to an agreed medium-term program of\n            reforms. It offers the potential in Peru, for example, of\n            now adjusting program elements to the requirements of\n            governmental decentralization, while maintaining the overall\n            coherence of its programmatic objectives. At the same time,\n            however, it potentially presents a trade-off between\n            maintaining continuity in support and evaluating rigorously\n            the achievements of program phases whose future direction\n            may change because of country circumstances. Judgment is\n            further complicated by the number of components, some of\n            which will inevitably progress more rapidly than others. The\n            probability of success of fast-disbursing programmatic loans\n            that require substantial analytical foundations and involve\n            significant institution building is enhanced by the\n            availability of financing for technical assistance. An\n            accompanying technical assistance loan or similar financing\n            under a parallel investment loan also provides the resources\n            and \"foot in the door\" for the intensive\n            supervision that is typically required by capacity-building\n            support. The agenda of reforms encompassed by the\n            Programmatic Social reform Loan (PSRL) and the successful\n            decentralization of government functions are, appropriately,\n            being given high priority in the assistance programs for\n            Peru of the Bank, other IFIs, UN and bilateral agencies.\n            Greater attention should be given by all involved to\n            achieving active coordination of these assistance efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Programmatic Social Reform Loan (02)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Programmatic Social

structural adjustment program in support of the medium-term\n            social reform policy, and, is a critical element of the\n            Bank's assistance to the Government's development\n            strategy. Specifically, the project will: 1) establish a\n            pro-poor social expenditure regime, and adequate social\n            protection mechanisms for the poor; 2) improve access by the\n            poor to critical social programs, by improving targeted\n            assistance, efficiency, and rationalization of expenditures;\n            and, 3) improve transparency in social programs, and\n            expenditures, as well as empower beneficiaries to\n            participate in policy, and budget processes. However, the\n            project differs from the previous programmatic operation in\n            a major way, at three levels: it attempts to link structural\n            adjustment actions with medium-term results indicators (many\n            related to the Millennium Development Goals); it facilitates\n            transition from short-term budget protection during a\n            prolonged economic slowdown, to a medium-term shift in pubic\n            expenditure to benefit the poor; and, it supports a\n            consistent program of social reforms, with a series of\n            single tranche adjustment loans, complemented closely by\n            technical assistance, and programmatic investment loans in\n            health, and education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Second
