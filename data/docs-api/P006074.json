The principal objectives of the program are: (a)\n            expansion of the existing generation, transmission and\n            distribution systems to meet projected demand throughout the\n            period; (b) improvement of plant efficiency to reduce\n            specific fuel consumption and relative cost per generated\n            kilowatt hour (kWh); (c) improvement of the transmission and\n            distribution systems by utilization of appropriate design to\n            keep energy losses at a minimum; (d) improvement of\n            BLPC's institutional capability by developing long\n            range planning for generation and plant; and (e) undertaking\n            an energy conservation program and maximizing the use of\n            indigenous energy resources such as gas and bagasse. The\n            Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange costs of\n            distribution components that are not being financed by other\n            sources. In addition it would finance the foreign exchange\n            costs of studies for energy conservation, generation\n            expansion and tariff structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Barbados - Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Barbados - Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/11/726190/barbados-power-project","projn":"BB-Power I-269759 -- P006074","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Carbon Policy and Trading,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Barbados","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912513694"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"barrels of\n            oil,boilers,Calculation,charcoal,civil\n            liability,Construction,consumption of energy,cooking,crude\n            oil,Debt,demand for electricity,diesel,diesel\n            generators,diesel units,Distribution Losses,domestic\n            crude,domestic use,drilling,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            growth,electric power,Electricity,electricity\n            conservation,electricity demand,Electricity\n            generation,Energy Balance,energy consumption,energy\n            consumption per capita,energy demand,energy loss,energy\n            losses,Energy Resources,energy supply,Engineering,excess\n            capacity,fire,Fuel,fuel consumption,Fuel Cost,fuel\n            requirements,fuels,gas turbine,gas wells,generation\n            capacity,growth in demand,heat,heat rate,heating\n            system,heavy oil,hydrocarbons,Imports,Income,increasing\n            energy demand,indigenous energy,indigenous energy\n            resources,Insurance,insurance coverage,lighting,load\n            flow,load growth,lubricants,marginal\n            cost,marking,mass,natural gas,oil,oil company,Oil\n            Corporation,oil equivalent,oil prices,peak\n            demand,Petroleum,Petroleum Gas,Petroleum products,power\n            generation,power plants,power supply,power utilities,price\n            of electricity,price of oil,primary energy,Proven\n            reserves,public hearings,renewable energy,renewable energy\n            resources,rural electrification,safety,securities,small\n            diesels,solar energy,steam plant,streamlining,sugar\n            factory,Sugar industry,surcharges,technicians,total\n            energy,Transport,Utilities,water heating"},"1":{"cdata!":"barrels of\n            oil,boilers,Calculation,charcoal,civil\n            liability,Construction,consumption of energy,cooking,crude\n            oil,Debt,demand for electricity,diesel,diesel\n            generators,diesel units,Distribution Losses,domestic\n            crude,domestic use,drilling,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            growth,electric power,Electricity,electricity\n            conservation,electricity demand,Electricity\n            generation,Energy Balance,energy consumption,energy\n            consumption per capita,energy demand,energy loss,energy\n            losses,Energy Resources,energy supply,Engineering,excess\n            capacity,fire,Fuel,fuel consumption,Fuel Cost,fuel\n            requirements,fuels,gas turbine,gas wells,generation\n            capacity,growth in demand,heat,heat rate,heating\n            system,heavy oil,hydrocarbons,Imports,Income,increasing\n            energy demand,indigenous energy,indigenous energy\n            resources,Insurance,insurance coverage,lighting,load\n            flow,load growth,lubricants,marginal\n            cost,marking,mass,natural gas,oil,oil company,Oil\n            Corporation,oil equivalent,oil prices,peak\n            demand,Petroleum,Petroleum Gas,Petroleum products,power\n            generation,power plants,power supply,power utilities,price\n            of electricity,price of oil,primary energy,Proven\n            reserves,public hearings,renewable energy,renewable energy\n            resources,rural electrification,safety,securities,small\n            diesels,solar energy,steam plant,streamlining,sugar\n            factory,Sugar industry,surcharges,technicians,total\n            energy,Transport,Utilities,water heating"}},"owner":"Caribbean Countries CMU (LCC3C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"3137"},"facets":{}}}
