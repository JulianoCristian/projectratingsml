The project financed economically sound\n            subprojects which increased agricultural exports, especially\n            of citrus, bananas and shrimp. Bank's performance in\n            project identification and appraisal was deficient. The Bank\n            did not adequately appraise the major factors limiting\n            exports, nor did it to determine the extent to which scarce\n            credit limited export growth. The Borrower's\n            performance is judged to be highly satisfactory in terms of\n            sector policy reform. Some lessons learned included:\n            government-owned development finance institutions are\n            unlikely to succeed in achieving both a social objective and\n            financial sustainability at the same time; reform and\n            restructuring of a government-owned development finance\n            institution is more likely to succeed, if it is subject to\n            the discipline of the market; change in macroeconomic and\n            sector policies can have a more positive impact than project\n            financial investments; and private financial intermediaries\n            will not actively participate, unless they are carefully\n            consulted on all the policies and procedures for a credit\n            line during its preparation,
