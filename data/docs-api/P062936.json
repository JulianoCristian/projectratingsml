The more traditional activities of\n            an export credit agency such as guarantees without finance\n            and credit insurance were not addressed because at the time\n            of appraisal they were not requested by the banking or\n            exporting community. As activity increased at the Investment\n            Guarantee Agency (IGA), it was realized that the more\n            traditional activities of an export credit agency needed to\n            be included in order to provide a comprehensive service to\n            the exporting and banking community. The project was\n            restructured to provide IGA with the authority to use World\n            Bank funds under the project to support these additional\n            facilities. At the same time, it was realized that if IGA\n            was to be effective as an export credit agency, have\n            permanent status, and have the same impact on exports as its\n            counterparts in nearby countries such as the Czech Republic,\n            Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia it would need to have\n            equity capital that was adequate in accordance with accepted\n            prudential standards within the industry. Accordingly, the\n            initiative was commenced by IGA and the government to create\n            new law for IGA by government legislation and to transfer\n            the donor and project funds under the Emergency Industrial\n            Restart Project and this project, onto the balance sheet of\n            IGA. The impact of the project during the implementation\n            period would have been greater had IGA been authorized to\n            use World Bank funds to support these traditional facilities\n            from the time of effectiveness, and project funds had been\n            transferred to IGA as equity progressively as funds were\n            drawn down from the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

There are three project components. The first\n            component consists of a working capital facility, a\n            revolving line of credit that provides working capital loans\n            to exporting enterprises having specific and signed export\n            contracts. The second component comprises a performance bond\n            facility which allows companies to tender for major\n            construction and supply export contracts by giving security\n            to bond giving banks. This security is provided by placing\n            International Development Association (IDA) funds on trust\n            in an offshore bank account available to reimburse\n            commercial insurance companies that will guarantee the bond\n            givers. The third component provides technical assistance to\n            strengthen the Investment Guarantee Agency (IGA) and\n            exporters. It institutionally reinforces the IGA's\n            operations by building its credit assessment capability,\n            assisting it in processing applications for working\n            capital/performance bonds; and finances short-term\n            assistance in such areas as financial management, auditing,\n            and legal and environmental services. This component makes\n            the services of external consultants available to exporters,\n            and finances office equipment and vehicles for IGA as well\n            as its operating costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -
