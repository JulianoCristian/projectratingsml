The advantages\n            and disadvantages of building on previous projects need to\n            be carefully examined during project preparation. While the\n            introduction of the mobile health teams and the Result-based\n            Financing (RBF) contradicted this lesson, this was justified\n            by the fact that when the existing delivery of services is\n            so poor and the need for services so great, important risks\n            are warranted, even without adequate feasibility studies.\n            For the follow-on project, more 'due diligence' is\n            in progress to assess accurately the risks of the operation\n            with a view to build stronger government ownership. The\n            importance of efficiency as a criterion for assessing health\n            and social development projects must be seen in a broader\n            context. There is no substitute for timely baseline data and\n            an operational Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Second Population and AIDS

The additional\n            financing will extend the new integrated and decentralized\n            approach to HIV/AIDS and maternal and child health services\n            in ten health districts in five regions, in addition to the\n            capital city, Ndjamena. This approach decentralizes\n            oversight to local governments, involves community-based\n            organization in service delivery, and expands the use of\n            mobile teams to reach isolated villages. It will also\n            introduce a results-based financing (RBF) approach to\n            improve maternal and child health outcomes that will be\n            piloted in two additional regions. Lastly, the additional\n            financing will strengthen monitoring and evaluation,\n            including data collection, analysis, and the use of national\n            household based surveys,
