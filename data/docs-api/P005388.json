The project would be an\n            essential part of the Government's newly emphasized\n            policy aimed at slowing down rural out migration by\n            concentrating activities and amenities in well selected\n            rural centers. The project would contribute to increasing\n            productivity in the agricultural sector, creating employment\n            and improving living conditions in rural areas. No special\n            risks are foreseen in the implementation of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Village Electrification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Village Electrification Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/04/726620/morocco-village-electrification-project","projn":"MA-Village Electrification -- P005388","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Engineering,Business Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Energy Demand,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912440069"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            services,Accounts,acquisition,agricultural uses,appropriate\n            technology,average cost of supply,balance of\n            payments,coal,coal production,conservation,consumption of\n            energy,cost accounting,Cost Estimates,cost\n            overruns,dams,demand for electricity,demand for\n            energy,domestic energy,economies of scale,efficient\n            use,efficient use of energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity sales,electricity\n            supply,employment,Energy Balance,energy consumption,energy\n            consumption levels,energy intensive,Energy Policy,energy\n            prices,Energy Resources,Engineering,engineering\n            design,Environmental Impact,financial autonomy,financial\n            subsidies,fossil fuel,Fuel,fuel oil,Gas reserves,growth in\n            demand,imports,Income,irrigation,lighting,local\n            authorities,Mines,Natural Gas,nuclear energy,nuclear\n            power,offshore exploration,Oil,oil production,oil\n            refineries,oil shale,Overhead,petroleum,petroleum\n            products,pollution,population,power generation,power\n            stations,price of oil,Primary Energy,primary energy\n            consumption,primary energy\n            requirements,Procurement,production of\n            electricity,productivity,pumps,rainfall,refineries,residential\n            customers,river basins,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,savings,shale oil,solar energy,tools,types\n            of energy,urban,urban population,water\n            distribution,Willingness to Pay,WTP"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            services,Accounts,acquisition,agricultural uses,appropriate\n            technology,average cost of supply,balance of\n            payments,coal,coal production,conservation,consumption of\n            energy,cost accounting,Cost Estimates,cost\n            overruns,dams,demand for electricity,demand for\n            energy,domestic energy,economies of scale,efficient\n            use,efficient use of energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity sales,electricity\n            supply,employment,Energy Balance,energy consumption,energy\n            consumption levels,energy intensive,Energy Policy,energy\n            prices,Energy Resources,Engineering,engineering\n            design,Environmental Impact,financial autonomy,financial\n            subsidies,fossil fuel,Fuel,fuel oil,Gas reserves,growth in\n            demand,imports,Income,irrigation,lighting,local\n            authorities,Mines,Natural Gas,nuclear energy,nuclear\n            power,offshore exploration,Oil,oil production,oil\n            refineries,oil shale,Overhead,petroleum,petroleum\n            products,pollution,population,power generation,power\n            stations,price of oil,Primary Energy,primary energy\n            consumption,primary energy\n            requirements,Procurement,production of\n            electricity,productivity,pumps,rainfall,refineries,residential\n            customers,river basins,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,savings,shale oil,solar energy,tools,types\n            of energy,urban,urban population,water\n            distribution,Willingness to Pay,WTP"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"World"},"1":{"geo_region":"World"}},"repnb":"2385","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Maroc - Projet d'Electrification Rurale"}}},"facets":{}}}
