Key\n            lessons learned under the project include: The impact of the\n            public extension service can be increased by focusing on\n            proper management, and regularly training and supervising\n            staff at all levels. There is an urgent need to address\n            institutional reform in Cameroon's agricultural sector.\n            This includes clarifying the roles and functions of the\n            various ministries involved, revamping administrative\n            procedures including procedures for financial and human\n            resource management, restructuring the organization of the\n            ministries towards a stronger decentralization and reduction\n            of headquarters staff, sub-contracting service delivery\n            where possible, and increasing involvement of beneficiaries\n            and stakeholders in the planning and priority setting\n            processes. The quality of the technical messages improves\n            when front-line extension staff and subject matter\n            specialists are better equipped and trained to listen to\n            farmers and to carry out farming system analysis. Extension\n            should incorporate traditional mass media and modern\n            information technology, strengthen community participation\n            and oversight, improve monitoring and evaluation, and\n            further strengthen research/extension linkages. The impact\n            of the demonstration plots on the use of inputs has\n            relatively little impact on farmers' investments for\n            non-cash crop-related inputs; this is mainly due to lack of\n            credit availability. Issues more relevant to female farmers\n            and more female staff need to be added."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Agricultural Extension and\n            Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon -
