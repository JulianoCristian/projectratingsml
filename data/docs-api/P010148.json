Third Water Supply and Sewerage Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the Third Water Supply\n            and Sewerage Project for Nepal was unsatisfactory due to the\n            inexperience of the Borrower (Water Supply and Sewerage\n            Board) and unrealistic expectations of the Bank. The Water\n            Supply and Sewerage Board lacked the financial income and\n            operational management skills to oversee the project. The\n            Bank put too much pressure on the Water Supply and Sewerage\n            Board to improve its financial performance and meet its loan\n            agreements. This situation neglected the main objectives of\n            the project and caused several problems. Start-up was slow\n            and effectiveness was delayed. The implementation of the\n            project was also delayed due to design changes, slowness of\n            local civil contractors, concern over sewerage designs, and\n            inertia in the Water Supply and Sewerage Board itself. There\n            are many lessons to be learned from this situation. First,\n            the Bank spent too much time and effort on financial issues\n            and illusive objects. It would have been more productive to\n            focus on improving source and distribution system management\n            and developing the Water Supply and Sewerage Board's\n            awareness of its role in the urban sector in Nepal. Second,\n            institutional development problems are not always internal.\n            It is necessary to review and address the external operating\n            environment and the extent to which the government monitors\n            or influences institutional performance. Finally, water and\n            sewerage projects in urban areas should not be developed in isolation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Third Water Supply and Sewerage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal -

population by 1990. The five year project (FY1981-85)\n            would: (i) improve and extend water supply and sewerage\n            works initiated under the previous two projects, to further\n            extend the supply hours and increase the number of persons\n            served; (ii) upgrade and extend water supply systems in six\n            additional towns; and (iii) provide institutional support to\n            the WSSB. After completion of the project, about 97% of the\n            population in the Kathmandu Valley and Pokhara and 60% of\n            the population in the additional towns would have access to\n            24-hour service of safe water. Consultant services would be\n            provided to assist with complex design work, preparation of\n            specifications and bidding documents as well as tender\n            evaluation of major contracts and for general construction\n            supervision. This technical assistance, support for the\n            in-house training program and the prudent project\n            implementation schedule reduce the risks of slow project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Third Water Supply and Sewerage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Third Water Supply and\n            Sewerage
