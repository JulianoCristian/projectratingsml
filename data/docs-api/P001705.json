Technical\n            assistance would be provided for three tasks: (a)\n            Exploration. Under a PPF, the Basin was promoted to foreign\n            oil companies and contracts were successfully negotiated for\n            two oil wells. Activities of the companies would be\n            monitored for integrating the data collected into the\n            Government's data base. An accounting system would be\n            set up designed to monitor, control and audit expenditures\n            by the companies. (b) Research. Technical evaluation of the\n            quality of the Agamor oil shale deposits would be conducted\n            by sample collection and laboratory testing. If warranted,\n            an estimate of the size of the reserves would be carried\n            out. (c) Energy Studies. Energy studies would be conducted\n            to provide sectoral analysis for defining future policies,\n            to review the system of supply and pricing of petroleum\n            products and to assess institutional training and technical\n            assistance needs for strengthening planning capabilities.\n            Terms of reference for consultant services include\n            on-the-job training of local counterpart staff and in\n            addition, eight fellowships would be provided for training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Petroleum Exploration Promotion
