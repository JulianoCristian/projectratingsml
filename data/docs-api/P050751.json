Lessons learned included: 1) One of the key\n            lessons learned in NNP is that projects can set themselves\n            up for failure by defining overly ambitious, ambiguous, and\n            un-measurable targets; 2) Future projects must address\n            possible contentious issues early on in project preparation\n            by working closely with government; 3) The process of\n            scaling up should be undertaken with care. An essential\n            prerequisite is to have a robust evaluation of the pilot, so\n            that lessons learned can be incorporated into the new\n            project; 4) Frequent changes of leadership and turnover of\n            staff both within the Bank and the borrower, and among the\n            implementing agencies are detrimental to implementation; 5)\n            Enhance program impact through decentralizing\n            decision-making, incentives and accountability; 6) Provide\n            additional assistance in preparing follow-on operations; 7)\n            Monitoring of NGO contracting is particularly important\n            since it is often subjected to undue influence from\n            political/bureaucratic bosses; 8) Keep flexibility in\n            project design to be able to adjust project components based\n            on emerging evidence from operations research; 9) Since\n            behavior change needs to occur among poor, often illiterate\n            women in rural settings, it is important that the focus of\n            behavior change communication (BCC) activities through\n            inter-personal communication at the grassroots level is\n            intensified even further; 10) Sustained effort required to\n            address malnutrition in Bangladesh; and 11) Invest in\n            operations research and monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            and ensure that the results are appropriately utilized to\n            update project design and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - National Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - National Nutrition Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/03/7572274/bangladesh-national-nutrition-project","projn":"BD-National Nutrition Project -- P050751","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Rural Poverty Reduction,Nutrition,Population Policies,Early Child and Children's Health","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070430112717"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Law and justice,Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to health care, access to health care\n            services, adolescent girls, anemia, Behavior Change,\n            Beneficiary Survey, blindness, breast-feeding,\n            Breastfeeding, breastfeeding practices, capacity assessment,\n            capacity constraints, child growth, child growth monitoring,\n            Child health, child nutrition, child nutrition outcomes,\n            childbearing, Community Nutrition, complementary feeding,\n            complementary food, complementary foods, Development\n            Objectives, Diarrheal Disease, environmental impacts, Family\n            Welfare, fewer children, Folic Acid, food insecure\n            households, food intake, food security, gender equity,\n            growth promotion, health care services, health education,\n            health sector, household food security, household income,\n            household incomes, household level, human capital, human\n            capital formation, Human Development, infants, Information\n            System, intervention, iodization, Iron, iron deficiency,\n            lack of food, lack of knowledge, local communities, local\n            community, low birth weight, malnutrition, malnutrition\n            among children, malnutrition in children, malnutrition\n            rates, maternal and child health, micronutrient\n            deficiencies, micronutrient interventions, micronutrient\n            supplementation, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health,\n            moderate child malnutrition, mortality, National level,\n            National Plan, National Plan of Action, National Strategy,\n            NUTRITION, nutrition education, nutrition interventions,\n            nutrition knowledge, Nutrition Policy, nutrition programs,\n            nutrition sector, nutrition services, nutrition status,\n            nutrition surveillance, nutritional practices, nutritional\n            status, nutritional surveillance, poor women, Population\n            Sector, Population Sector Strategy, Poverty Reduction,\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy, Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            Paper, pregnancy, pregnant women, primary health care,\n            primary health care system, productivity, progress, protein,\n            protein-energy malnutrition, public health, public health\n            problem, Quality Assurance, religious leaders, reproductive\n            age, safeguards, salt iodization, school curricula, service\n            delivery, severe malnutrition, social development, social\n            development goals, supplementary feeding, technical skills,\n            unmarried adolescent, Vitamin, Vitamin A, vulnerable groups,\n            women of childbearing age, workers, World Food Program,\n            young child, young child nutrition, young children"}},"owner":"S.A.

The project consists of two\n            components. The first, the Service Component, is comprised\n            of two sub-components: Area-based community nutrition\n            services improve behavioral practices in critical areas such\n            as breastfeeding, timely introduction of solid foods, and\n            increased food intake during pregnancy. It also increases\n            awareness and treatment of malnutrition in the primary care\n            health system and provides food security and\n            income-generating activities to the poorest households in\n            the community. The second sub-component funds a foundation\n            promoting and protecting breastfeeding; funds a program for\n            national micro-nutrient supplements; and provides technical\n            assistance to draft legislation on fortification and food\n            quality standards. The second component, the Project Support\n            and Institutional Development Component, consists of three\n            sub-components: project management and institutional\n            development; monitoring, evaluation, and operations\n            research; and training and behavioral change communications.\n            This component strengthens the management capacities of\n
