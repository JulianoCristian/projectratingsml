The key lessons convey\n            primarily, the importance of involving beneficiaries, as of\n            the early stages, in project selection, preparation, and\n            design, to attain project ownership, as shown by the success\n            of this project. The creative innovation of a financial\n            management consultant, responsible for payments,\n            disbursement commitments, and project account monitoring,\n            although successful in comparison to the former independent\n            banks' approach, did not achieve the necessary\n            skills' transfer to Project Unit (PU) staff, hence,\n            sufficient capacity should be built within the PU in the\n            future. But, both the resource mobilization method of a\n            standing payment order - which avoided experienced delays in\n            obtaining counterpart funds, - and, the establishment of a\n            maintenance account, for the release of funds for regular\n            drain maintenance, proved successful. However, the lack of\n            clearly defined responsibilities between consultants and PU\n            staff, was conducive to conflicting situations, where\n            legitimate instructions were ignored. This should be defined\n            alongside the enhancement for PU supervision capacity, and\n            training needs, as well as an increased flexibility in\n            contract documents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Lagos Drainage and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Lagos Drainage and\n            Sanitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/10/728542/nigeria-lagos-drainage-sanitation-project","projn":"NG-Lagos Drainage & San -- P002175","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Roads & Highways,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99110205301580"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Solid waste management,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"billing,cables,Community\n            Development,community health,community\n            participation,concrete,construction,construction\n            methods,construction\n            sites,culverts,Drainage,drainage,dredging,electricity,emissions,Environmental\n            Protection,excreta,extension,feasibility studies,Financial\n            Management,flooding,framework,haulage,highways,Housing,innovation,laboratory\n            equipment,litter,living conditions,loading,municipal\n            finance,PCU,pollution,pollution control,Private sector,rate\n            of return,roads,sanitary drainage,Sanitation,sanitation\n            services,sewerage,sewerage systems,solid waste,solid waste\n            management,spare parts,storm water,street\n            lighting,streets,terrain,traffic,traffic\n            congestion,transformers,transportation,vehicles,Waste,waste\n            disposal,Waste Management,waste water,waste water\n            treatment,water,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"billing,cables,Community\n            Development,community health,community\n            participation,concrete,construction,construction\n            methods,construction\n            sites,culverts,Drainage,drainage,dredging,electricity,emissions,Environmental\n            Protection,excreta,extension,feasibility studies,Financial\n            Management,flooding,framework,haulage,highways,Housing,innovation,laboratory\n            equipment,litter,living conditions,loading,municipal\n            finance,PCU,pollution,pollution control,Private sector,rate\n            of return,roads,sanitary drainage,Sanitation,sanitation\n            services,sewerage,sewerage systems,solid waste,solid waste\n            management,spare parts,storm water,street\n            lighting,streets,terrain,traffic,traffic\n            congestion,transformers,transportation,vehicles,Waste,waste\n            disposal,Waste Management,waste water,waste water\n            treatment,water,water supply"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"19762"},"3686896":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/11/3686896/nigeria-lagos-drainage-sanitation-project-report-recommendation-request-inspection","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/11/3686896/nigeria-lagos-drainage-sanitation-project-report-recommendation-request-inspection","new_url":"1998/11/3686896/nigeria-lagos-drainage-sanitation-project-report-recommendation-request-inspection","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/05/25/000265513_20040525111851/Rendered/INDEX/28417.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/05/25/000265513_20040525111851/Rendered/PDF/28417.pdf","credit_no":"2517","docdt":"1998-11-10T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2004-05-25T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Lagos Drainage and Sanitation\n            Project : Report and Recommendation on Request for Inspection"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Report and Recommendation on the\n            Request for Inspection of the Lagos Drainage and Sanitation\n            Project in Nigeria examines claims made the Requesters and\n            whether an investigation needs to take place.
