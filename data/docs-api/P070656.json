multi-donor national forest\n            and environment sector development program, initiated and\n            led by the Government of Cameroon. It will help consolidate\n            and scale up recent successful forest sector policy reforms,\n            support capacity-building, and strengthen forest and\n            environment institutions, by expanding their work programs\n            in the fields of environmental monitoring, policy oversight,\n            law enforcement, forest management, biodiversity\n            conservation, and community-based forest activities. Given\n            the concentration of poverty in rural areas (where most o f\n            the poor live, and where 64 percent of all inhabitants are\n            poor), the hardship and low wages typical of forest\n            employment, and the forest's role as the principal\n            source of cash income for the rural poor - the operation is\n            self-targeting on the poor. Through its focus on sectoral\n            policy, institutional reform, law enforcement, regulation of\n            forest production and environmental monitoring,\n            rehabilitation of degraded national parks and biodiversity\n            conservation sites, the project will have a strong positive\n            impact on the environment. However, the project carries\n            significant risks associated with political and financial\n            sustainability. For the Bank, there are also fiduciary\n            risks. Nonetheless, the project integrates comprehensive\n            measures to address or mitigate each risk: it is designed\n            and sequenced to build institutional capacity to effectively\n            address these risks. Given the Bank's considerable\n            involvement in sector reforms over the past several years in\n            Cameroon, any potential downside associated with inaction\n            would far
