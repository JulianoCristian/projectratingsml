Some of the lessons learned\n            from the project are: 1) the principal lesson that can be\n            drawn from project implementation is that top\n            entrepreneurial management is necessary to invest and\n            monitor the use of such a large portfolio. A business\n            operation managed by people with a public service or\n            development aid profile is likely to under perform; 2) the\n            combination of local business relations, understanding of\n            the local business realities and private money could have\n            been obtained by including from the beginning a local\n            private financial institution as partner in Bolivian Export\n            Foundation (BEF); and 3) in a legal framework where\n            contracts can not be enforced through courts, official\n            business is hard to carry out. Companies in Bolivia are\n            mainly family businesses which can enforce contracts using\n            multiple contract compliance strategies. An organization\n            such as BEF does not have this type of business\n            relationships and has difficulty working in such environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Agro-Export Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia -

The\n            project finances three main components:  (a) the operations\n            of the BEF, including its enterprise investment program,\n            which initially is expected to consist of five joint\n            ventures and subsidiaries; (b) the employment of a\n            management firm to provide four experts for the BEF; and (c)\n            the provision by the BEF of technical assistance for\n            carrying out market research and feasibility studies for\n            identifying new investment opportunities for export of\n            additional agricultural products from Bolivia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Agro-export Development Program\n            (AEDP) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Agro-export Development\n            Program (AEDP) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/11/735619/bolivia-agro-export-development-program-aedp-project","projn":"BO-Agro Export Development Program -- P006153","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961001173123"},"subsc":"Agro-industry,Crops,Animal production,Agricultural extension and research,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,adverse effects,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,agriculture,auditors,BANK\n            LOANS,debt,devaluation,dividends,economic\n            conditions,economic growth,employment,Equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,exports,families,farmers,feasibility studies,financial\n            management,financial markets,financial policies,Financial\n            Sector,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,forestry,GDP,Government\n            expenditures,growth\n            rate,Income,incomes,laws,livestock,macroeconomic\n            management,macroeconomic performance,macroeconomic\n            policy,marketing,operational risks,overhead costs,potential\n            investors,primary health care,private\n            sector,producers,public sector,Rural\n            Development,silk,structural\n            adjustment,subsidiaries,subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,Water Supply,wood,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,adverse effects,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,agriculture,auditors,BANK\n            LOANS,debt,devaluation,dividends,economic\n            conditions,economic growth,employment,Equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,exports,families,farmers,feasibility studies,financial\n            management,financial markets,financial policies,Financial\n            Sector,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,forestry,GDP,Government\n            expenditures,growth\n            rate,Income,incomes,laws,livestock,macroeconomic\n            management,macroeconomic performance,macroeconomic\n            policy,marketing,operational risks,overhead costs,potential\n            investors,primary health care,private\n            sector,producers,public sector,Rural\n            Development,silk,structural\n            adjustment,subsidiaries,subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,Water Supply,wood,working capital"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development Dept (LCSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF024780-AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROG\n            IN BOLIVIA,TF021956-AGRICULTURAL EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,TF033234-BOLIVIA - AGRO EXPORT\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF021955-AGRICULTURAL EXPORT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM","repnb":"P5575"},"facets":{}}}
