Some lessons learned included:\n            Renewable Energy (RE) sector development can be successfully\n            achieved through establishing a comprehensive framework\n            including: (i) developing all relevant policy, legislation,\n            incentive scheme, rulebooks, land acquisition procedures,\n            bidding packages, licensing processes; (ii) engaging with\n            all relevant stakeholders such as regulator, Ministry of\n            Economy (MoE), Macedonian Bank for Development and Promotion\n            (MBDP), Energy Agency (EA); and (iii) demonstrating\n            implementation through a project such as the 1MW solar PV\n            plant delivered under the SEFF. Based on the GEF's\n            expectations from EE projects, including e.g. guarantee\n            products, a standalone Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n            grant may not be a flexible enough instrument for Bank\n            Energy Efficiency (EE) projects. A more effective approach\n            could involve a blend of GEF grant and Bank loan, or a\n            planned approach whereby a Bank loan would be activated one\n            to two years into the project. Looking back at the lessons\n            learnt reflected in the project design at appraisal stage,\n            the guarantee instrument proposed as part of the Sustainable\n            Energy Financing Facility (SEFF) based on the success from\n            the International Finance Corporation, or IFC and Global\n            Environment Facility, or GEF supported Hungary EE\n            Co-Financing Program failed to attract interest not only in\n            the project, but also in other EE initiatives such as the\n            Poland Energy Efficiency project. The market's interest\n            in guarantee instruments to support EE programs therefore\n            needs to be reconsidered in future EE projects. The other\n            main lesson learnt discussed at appraisal considers the\n            advantages of an Energy Service Company (ESCO) model and\n            recognizes that some trial and error, flexibility, and\n            additional time may be required during implementation. The\n            experience of the project shows that this lessons stands,\n            and that in the case of FYR Macedonia, may apply to a period\n            following a successful implementation of measures in the\n            public sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of -\n            Sustainable Energy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav\n            Republic of -
