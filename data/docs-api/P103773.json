Private sector development in Malawi was\n            constrained by several factors such as unreliable\n            electricity, shortage of skilled personnel, expensive and\n            restricted access to credit, and a difficult regulatory\n            environment. As a result, private domestic and foreign\n            investment remained inadequate to accelerate economic\n            growth. Several interventions in the Business Environment\n            Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP)\n            contributed to improving the doing business climate in\n            Malawi. Laws affecting doing business were reviewed to\n            reduce legal constraints in business processes. The project\n            established institutions and systems that are expected to\n            remain sustainable, such as the Commercial Division of the\n            High Court. The revised laws would also encourage government\n            to appreciate the value of business-friendly laws for any\n            new laws that might be enacted. Computerized systems for\n            registering businesses and land are also expected to\n            continue as the norm because these systems are a significant\n            improvement in a digitized world. Since 2007, BESTAP\n            interventions collectively improved access to commercial\n            justice, with cases that used to take close to a year being\n            resolved in three months. Issues on property rights also\n            improved with time taken to register a property or business\n            reducing by more than 60 percent. More than one thousand\n            small and medium enterprises accessed technical advice and\n            services that helped them improve their productivity and sales."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Easing
