Lessons learned from the\n            project. The eleven schools built under Second Education\n            Project (SEP) are attractive structures which will serve as\n            relatively high quality schools for years to come as\n            Bhutan's rapid development continues. SEP-financed\n            schools lack a sufficient number of books to stock new\n            libraries. The outcome of implementation of the civil works\n            activities under SEP demonstrate the importance of carrying\n            out advance preparatory tasks, including site surveys, the\n            development of designs and drawings, the simplification of\n            bidding documents, and capacity building at the local level.\n            A key impediment to the effective use of new teaching\n            approaches for improved classroom management and to\n            stimulate children's learning can be largely attributed\n            to a lack of familiarity with them. Lessons learned from the\n            vast literature on the importance of good school leadership\n            for instituting pedagogic reforms and effective management\n            of schools are in evidence in Bhutan.

The project has four components. 1) Increasing and\n            upgrading facilities for basic education by constructing new\n            schools, substantially upgrading existing schools, and\n            supporting decentralized construction; 2) expanding and\n            improving teacher education; revising curriculum; and\n            supporting central, district, and school-based in-service\n            teacher-training programs; 3) improving learning processes\n            by curriculum development, examining learning processes,\n            revising existing examinations and introducing standardized\n            tests, and developing resource centers, school networks, and\n            the supplementary reading program; and 4) strengthening\n            educational management and administration by further\n            strengthening the professional skills of central staff and\n            developing the capacity to introduce a decentralized school\n            monitoring and
