Some lessons learned included: the supervision of\n            the project seems to have been critical for project\n            implementation. Important factors that would have supported\n            project success are: appropriate technical advice;\n            continuity of Bank staff, consistent follow-up, timely\n            response to the Borrower and cooperation with the Borrower\n            team. Technical Assistance (TA) should be short-term and\n            focused on beneficiary needs. Likewise training should\n            correspond to beneficiary-identified needs, and be provided\n            on site, whenever possible, by qualified trainers. The\n            reforms subject to political risks were not implemented\n            under the project. These reforms should be put as up-front\n            conditions. The time needed to change attitudes and\n            approaches should be taken into account during the\n            preparation so that reforms may be implemented before Board\n            presentation. The unreliability of Togolese counterpart\n            funding should be considered as a major risk for any\n            project, and all precautions should be taken to mitigate\n            this risk. Agreements reached during negotiations are not a\n            sufficient answer. This issue should be continuously\n            addressed during project preparation and implementation and\n            appropriate actions should be taken in case of default."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo -
