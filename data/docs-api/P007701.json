The\n            assessment confirms the following OED lessons of broader\n            relevance. Projects need to dovetail with programs; but\n            well-designed projects can rarely turn around a\n            poorly-designed program. This is a particularly important\n            lesson for the Bank's work in Mexico where leverage is\n            limited. Mexico has ample access to alternative sources of\n            funding, private as well as public. In line with the\n            Bank's poverty reduction mandate, its resources should\n            be tightly targeted, rather than added to programs where\n            there is a high potential for subsidies to be captured by\n            better-off groups. The Bank's leverage may be\n            substantially diluted when project funds flow into a\n            multi-state program which state governments have\n            considerable influence over the use to which resources are\n            put. Large Programs are candidates for formal impact\n            evaluation. In this case, the main limitation of the Alianza\n            evaluation was the absence of a control group of\n            non-beneficiaries, a striking oversight given the level of\n            funding committed. The evaluation should have sampled those\n            who did not apply to the program; and those who did but were\n            rejected. (It is not clear that a list of the rejected is\n            maintained.) Without this control it is impossible to assess\n            claims about the program's leverage: much of the\n            investment (and the income growth attributed to it) might\n            have occurred without a subsidy. Subsidies may have leaked\n            to better-off groups who don't need them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Irrigation and Drainage Sector,\n            On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement, and\n            Agricultural Productivity Improvement Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico -

The lessons\n            learned indicate that irrigation agriculture should be\n            complemented by training and improvement of technology. The\n            project requires the inclusion of a co-executing agency, an\n            arrangement and binding agreement should be established on\n            modalities of collaboration in project implementation. An\n            improvement in networks, canal lining, etc. improves water\n            quality, saves water, and contributes to the sustainable\n            management of the environment. Decentralization of\n            management and additional activities, such as improving the\n            technical capacity of water user organizations, improve\n            regulations and procedures such as water tariff payments.\n            Establish a national contingency fund to assist in covering\n            financial costs during economic crisis. Transfer of\n            irrigation management and the cultural shift towards more\n            consolidation work create a strong demand for credit by\n            water users organizations to invest in their individual\n            plots. The acquisition of machinery by modules showed a very\n            positive result.

           irrigation subsector more efficient and less reliant on\n            government funds, through shared investments by\n            beneficiaries and the government. Specific objectives are\n            to: (a) reduce loss and waste of irrigation water; (b)\n            promote decentralization and private investment in\n            irrigation; (c) increase cropping intensities and yields;\n            and (d) increase crop diversification into higher value\n            crops. The operation has three components. The first\n            component, technological support, communications and\n            training, will assist farmers and their Water Users\n            Organizations (WUOs) to develop and implement improvements\n            in minor network and on-farm irrigation systems. The second\n            component, minor network improvements, is comprised mainly\n            of field surveys, engineering works, small irrigation and\n            drainage networks, water measurement and control structures,\n            access roads, electrical distribution systems, regulating\n            works and equipment. The component is designed to help\n            farmers and their WUOs to improve off-farm minor irrigation\n            and drainage networks related to command areas of between 80\n            and 500 hectares. The third component, on-farm improvements,\n            is comprised mainly of land leveling, on-farm distribution\n            and drainage systems, control and measurement devices,\n            internal regulating tanks, and pressurized irrigation systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - On-Farm and Minor Irrigation\n            Networks Improvement

           irrigation subsector more efficient and less reliant on\n            government funds, through shared investments by\n            beneficiaries and the government. Specific objectives are\n            to: (a) reduce loss and waste of irrigation water; (b)\n            promote decentralization and private investment in\n            irrigation; (c) increase cropping intensities and yields;\n            and (d) increase crop diversification into higher value\n            crops. The operation has three components. The first\n            component, technological support, communications and\n            training, will assist farmers and their Water Users\n            Organizations (WUOs) to develop and implement improvements\n            in minor network and on-farm irrigation systems. The second\n            component, minor network improvements, is comprised mainly\n            of field surveys, engineering works, small irrigation and\n            drainage networks, water measurement and control structures,\n            access roads, electrical distribution systems, regulating\n            works and equipment. The component is designed to help\n            farmers and their WUOs to improve off-farm minor irrigation\n            and drainage networks related to command areas of between 80\n            and 500 hectares. The third component, on-farm improvements,\n            is comprised mainly of land leveling, on-farm distribution\n            and drainage systems, control and measurement devices,\n            internal regulating tanks, and pressurized irrigation systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - On-Farm and Minor Irrigation\n            Networks Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - On-Farm and Minor\n            Irrigation Networks Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/01/733037/mexico-on-farm-minor-irrigation-networks-improvement-project","projn":"MX-On-Farm & Minor Irrigation Networks\n            Improvement -- P007701","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005063510"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,Air Pollution,Air Pollution Control,allocation of\n            water,annual budget allocation,aquifers,audits,Competitive\n            Bidding,construction,cost recovery,cost sharing,crop\n            diversification,drainage systems,employment,environmental\n            monitoring,expenditures,exploitation,Export,farm\n            systems,farmers,farms,Forestry,income,Industrial\n            Sector,investment cost,irrigation,Irrigation\n            District,irrigation systems,irrigation water,land\n            use,logging,management of groundwater,management of\n            groundwater resources,marginal\n            cost,producers,productivity,project\n            management,pumping,pumping systems,resource\n            use,Salinity,savings,scarcity of water,Solid Waste,Solid\n            Waste Management,surface water,surface water\n            resources,transfer of water rights,Waste\n            Management,water,water distribution,water fees,Water\n            Law,water levels,water management,water pressure,water\n            prices,water rights,water supplies,Water Supply,water\n            table,water use,Water User"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,Air Pollution,Air Pollution Control,allocation of\n            water,annual budget allocation,aquifers,audits,Competitive\n            Bidding,construction,cost recovery,cost sharing,crop\n            diversification,drainage systems,employment,environmental\n            monitoring,expenditures,exploitation,Export,farm\n            systems,farmers,farms,Forestry,income,Industrial\n            Sector,investment cost,irrigation,Irrigation\n            District,irrigation systems,irrigation water,land\n            use,logging,management of groundwater,management of\n            groundwater resources,marginal\n            cost,producers,productivity,project\n            management,pumping,pumping systems,resource\n            use,Salinity,savings,scarcity of water,Solid Waste,Solid\n            Waste Management,surface water,surface water\n            resources,transfer of water rights,Waste\n            Management,water,water distribution,water fees,Water\n            Law,water levels,water management,water pressure,water\n            prices,water rights,water supplies,Water Supply,water\n            table,water use,Water User"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"P6149"},"facets":{}}}
