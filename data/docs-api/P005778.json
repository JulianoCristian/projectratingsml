The project would enable\n            IBY to play the pivotal role envisioned for it by the\n            Government in the development of YAR's nascent\n            industrial sector. It would provide IBY with: (i) funds to\n            meet about half of its resource requirements from 1981-1983;\n            and (ii) technical assistance for institution building. In\n            addition, the project would also provide for the\n            strengthening of the capability of the Government's\n            Department of Industry to prepare the Government's\n            plans, policies and priorities for the industrial sector.\n            The project faces no special risks, and measures to be taken\n            during project implementation will ensure that the risks\n            involved are minimized to the fullest extent possible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen Arab Republic - Industrial Bank Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen Arab Republic - Industrial\n            Bank Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/02/726137/yemen-arab-republic-industrial-bank-project","projn":"RY-Industrial Development -- P005778","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912521158"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,aggregate demand,Agricultural\n            Credit,agriculture,assets,authorized capital,balance of\n            payments,Balance Sheets,bank branches,banking\n            system,bidding,capital goods,capital loans,capital\n            markets,Central Bank,Central Bank of Yemen,Central\n            Planning,commercial banks,commercial borrowing,commercial\n            loans,comparative advantage,consumers,credit\n            guarantees,debt,demand deposits,development\n            banking,disposable income,economic analysis,Economic Rate of\n            Return,economic\n            sectors,economics,employment,entrepreneurship,Equity\n            capital,Equity investments,exchange\n            rate,exploitation,feasibility studies,Financial\n            Institutions,financial markets,financial resources,FINANCIAL\n            SECTOR,financial transactions,FISCAL YEAR,fixed\n            assets,foreign currency,foreign exchange,foreign\n            firms,foreign investment,GDP,growth\n            rate,Housing,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,industrialization,inflation,inflation\n            rate,Interest rate,Interest Rates,investment banking,labor\n            costs,Labor productivity,Laws,legislation,lending\n            rates,natural resources,net worth,onlending,organizational\n            structure,portfolio,productivity,public enterprises,real\n            GDP,resource mobilization,retained earnings,savings,savings\n            deposits,small business,specialized banks,technical\n            assistance,time deposits,transport,Value added,wages,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,aggregate demand,Agricultural\n            Credit,agriculture,assets,authorized capital,balance of\n            payments,Balance Sheets,bank branches,banking\n            system,bidding,capital goods,capital loans,capital\n            markets,Central Bank,Central Bank of Yemen,Central\n            Planning,commercial banks,commercial borrowing,commercial\n            loans,comparative advantage,consumers,credit\n            guarantees,debt,demand deposits,development\n            banking,disposable income,economic analysis,Economic Rate of\n            Return,economic\n            sectors,economics,employment,entrepreneurship,Equity\n            capital,Equity investments,exchange\n            rate,exploitation,feasibility studies,Financial\n            Institutions,financial markets,financial resources,FINANCIAL\n            SECTOR,financial transactions,FISCAL YEAR,fixed\n            assets,foreign currency,foreign exchange,foreign\n            firms,foreign investment,GDP,growth\n            rate,Housing,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,industrialization,inflation,inflation\n            rate,Interest rate,Interest Rates,investment banking,labor\n            costs,Labor productivity,Laws,legislation,lending\n            rates,natural resources,net worth,onlending,organizational\n            structure,portfolio,productivity,public enterprises,real\n            GDP,resource mobilization,retained earnings,savings,savings\n            deposits,small business,specialized banks,technical\n            assistance,time deposits,transport,Value added,wages,working capital"}},"owner":"Private Sector Dev & Finance Grp (MNSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"3211"},"facets":{}}}
