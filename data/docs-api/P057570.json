Some lessons learned included:\n            to provide assistance effectively to ten towns (or more), an\n            operation requires a wholesale project design that provides\n            Bank support through a country intermediary. The Bank cannot\n            provide hands-on retail assistance to so many\n            municipalities, especially with Bhutan's challenging\n            logistics for access. With no strong country-level\n            intermediary, the scope of a retail project should be\n            limited to fewer towns. The project experience clearly\n            demonstrates the need for building greater capacity for\n            local authorities to assess the efficiency of their\n            investments, especially to help them avoid losses from\n            sub-projects that, having incurred considerable costs, are\n            left idle and thereby generating few or no benefits.\n            Baselines must be clearly drawn and identified at appraisal\n            not only to make final evaluation more robust, but also to\n            be sure that a project is focused clearly at the outset upon\n            priority areas of need highlighted by the baseline data. As\n            urbanization takes root and accelerates, as it is in Bhutan,\n            it is important for each city and town to prepare and\n            implement its own urban plan. The plan should assess its\n            potential for developing efficiently within any physical\n            constraints it might face, while respecting prevailing\n            cultural values in land use planning and layouts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - Urban Development

Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) There is a trade-off between the number\n            of project towns and the level of effective engagement with\n            local governments, especially in Bhutan; 2) Clear\n            implementation arrangements and identification of capacity\n            constraints are paramount in a project, especially with\n            decentralized implementation responsibilities; 3) Monitoring\n            capacities need to be strengthened in central government\n            institutions; 4) Land development components require careful\n            preparation and cannot be simply subsumed as an offshoot of\n            civil works; 5) Township planning workshops should be part\n            of preparation not implementation; and 6) More attention\n            should be paid to ensure cultural coherence in urban\n            planning. Historically, Bhutan has been almost entirely\n            rural in terms of its patterns of human settlement.\n            Therefore, urban planning efforts need to be carefully\n            considered in terms of their coherence and congruence with\n            local norms, such as the layout of villages and esthetic\n            features of settlement areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan -

which\n            reviews environmental issues concerning urbanization. The\n            following measures are recommended for mitigation: Water\n            resources will be monitored and water treated to maintain\n            water quality, particularly during monsoon periods. The\n            district network system will be improved by replacing\n            defective pipes and connections, and improving skills in\n            pipelaying, as well as providing better materials, more\n            quality control during construction, more regular\n            maintenance, and civic education. More properly ventilated\n            pit latrines will be built and households with septic tanks\n            provided de-sludging and disposal facilities. Play-and-use\n            toilets will be built in the town centers. A public\n            awareness campaign will be aimed at making households\n            responsible for keeping local drains clean. Staff will be\n            trained to identify, prepare, and maintain solid waste\n            disposal sites. Garbage separation and recycling will be\n            activated through a public education campaign. Conservation\n            of significant heritage sites will require increased\n            attention to proper land use and zoning regulations and\n            their enforcement. Where rivers are eroding their banks in\n            some of the project towns, erosion control and protection\n            measures will be taken."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Urban Development Project :\n            sectoral environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan -
