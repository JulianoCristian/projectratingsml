Some lessons learned included: empowerment is\n            an important output for Community Driven Development (CDD).\n            One of the primary purposes of the CDD approach is to\n            empower local communities to affect change by improving the\n            process by which local development decisions are made. This\n            project attempt to use participatory Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) system did not work well. The rationale\n            for using a participatory M&E is that the beneficiaries,\n            by monitoring their own performance, will learn and adjust\n            accordingly. Adaptive management and learning is an\n            important ingredient for success. The flexible CDD design\n            used for this project allowed a rapid scaling up at the end\n            of the project in order to achieve the full benefit of cost\n            savings. This project demonstrated that, given a menu of\n            choices that included both community infrastructure and\n            livelihood investments; there was a strong demand for\n            livelihood investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Participatory Agricultural\n            Development and Empowerment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Participatory\n

seeks to\n            raise the production of food, incomes, and assets of\n            participating households and groups in about 840 villages in\n            a sustainable manner through the implementation of small\n            agricultural development subprojects planned and managed by\n            community members and farmers' groups. This objective\n            will be achieved by: (i) empowering self-selected rural\n            communities and farmers' groups to make decisions\n            regarding choice of sustainable and remunerative productive\n            technology; (ii) sharing of costs by the public sector and\n            participants, and hence sharing the risk of adoption of\n            improved technologies, again for self-selected participants;\n            (iii) enhancing demand for products and services provided by\n            the private sector in rural areas by increasing the\n            purchasing power of participating groups and encouraging the\n            growth of savings; (iv) promoting improved land and crop\n            husbandry practices by participants; (v) supporting the\n            ongoing decentralization process at the district level; and\n            (vi) partially financing maintenance and/or construction of\n            roads, bridges, and other small subprojects to improve\n            access to markets.  The project has two components: (i)\n            Community Agricultural Development Subprojects; and (ii)\n            Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening. The first\n            component will assist the government to provide matching\n            grants to communities and farmers' groups to finance\n            agricultural development subprojects selected through PRA\n            and approved by the Village Councils. Under this component,\n            the project will support both Community Investment\n            Subprojects (CIS) and Farmer Groups Investment Subprojects\n            (FGIS). Under this component, the Project Coordination Units\n            for Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar, together with the\n            Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security And the Ministry\n            of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and Cooperatives at\n            the national level, and the District Councils at the local\n            level, will be strengthened to enable them provide

involuntary resettlement and land\n            acquisition where feasible, to provide resettlement and\n            compensation activities as part of sustainable development\n            programs----while meaningfully consulting displaced and\n            compensated persons and providing them opportunities to\n            participate in planning and implementing resettlement\n            programs; and to improve or at least maintain the standard\n            of living. The policy applies to all displaced persons\n            regardless of the total number affected, the severity of\n            impact, and whether or not they have legal title to land.\n            Particular attention should be paid to the needs of\n            vulnerable groups among those displaced; especially those\n            below the poverty line, the landless, the elderly, women and\n            children, indigenous groups, and ethnic minorities or other\n            displaced persons who may not be protected through Tanzania\n            land compensation legislation. Implementation of the\n            sub-projects requiring resettlement plans cannot commence\n            before necessary measures for resettlement and compensation\n            are in place according to steps identified in the\n            resettlement plan. These measures will include providing for\n            compensation and other assistance required for relocation,\n            prior to displacement, and preparation and provision of\n            resettlement sites with adequate facilities, where required.\n            In particular, the taking of land and related assets may\n            take place only after compensation has been paid, and where\n            applicable, resettlement sites, new homes, related\n            infrastructure, public services, and moving allowances have\n            been provided to displaced persons. For subprojects\n            requiring relocation or loss of shelter, the policy further\n            requires that measures to assist the displaced persons be\n            implemented in accordance
