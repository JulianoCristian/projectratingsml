The lessons learned indicate that it is\n            imperative that the Government commits to a reform program\n            through effective advocacy to build a broad base of\n            understanding and support for reform. Lack of attention to\n            governance allows corruption to flourish and, poor\n            governance undermines the efforts of many cooperating\n            partners who need to make the case of continued support for\n            health reform in Zambia. Procurement capacity should be\n            strengthened. There is a widespread perception that the Bank\n            disengaged itself from the health reform process in Zambia\n            rather than working with other cooperating partners to\n            sustain the reform effort during a period when it was under\n            attack. Health sector reform is an intensive process and\n            requires strong attention to human resource issues. Health\n            staff need to have the right incentives, have access to\n            continued professional development, and be retained in the\n            health system in a productive manner.
