Key lessons learned follow. The\n            implementation of reforms in the banking sector was\n            successful due to successive Government's ownership of\n            the program and the commitment to move to a market based\n            economy. The twinning worked well in this case and proved to\n            be an effective mechanism for transferring know-how.\n            Important aspects for successful twinning are clear\n            expectations, sound work schedules, realistic pace, close\n            and candid monitoring, and the full involvement of senior\n            management of the local bank. Institution building is a\n            medium to long-term process requiring significant change in\n            minds and systems and significant training (the Bank was\n            over ambitious in estimating the time needed to implement\n            the comprehensive policy and institutional development\n            reforms). Bank's procurement procedures were perceived\n            as being complex, rigid, and not fully suitable for dealing\n            with procurement of complex software based information\n            technology. In hindsight, it may have been better to have\n            stayed with the original project proposal to finance the\n            basic, initial automation needs of the banks and leave the\n            financing of fully integrated systems for the future, at\n            which time they could have been financed directly by the\n            banks which would have had more flexibility to choose the\n            supplier and approaches to fit their individual needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Financial Institutions Development\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland

- Financial Institutions Development\n            Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objectives of the project are\n            to support financial sector development as a key element of\n            the Government's Economic Transformation Program\n            through:  (i) actions on the policy, regulatory, and\n            institutional fronts; and (ii) modernization and ultimate\n            privatization of existing banks. The project includes two\n            components:  (i) a quick-disbursing policy component; and\n            (ii) an institutional development component.  The major\n            policy reforms urgently needed to permit a rapid transition\n            toward a modern market-oriented, mostly private, financial\n            system must be accompanied by significant, concerted efforts\n            to develop efficient institutions and skilled staff.  There\n            is consequently a strong interrelation between the two\n            components and the success of the reform program will\n            closely depend on their timely joint implementation.  The\n            policy component is articulated around four elements: (i)\n            improvements of financial policies; (ii) modernization of\n            banking legislation; (iii) bank restructuring; and (iv)\n            development of financial markets.  The core of the\n            institutional development component relates to a\n            comprehensive program of technical assistance and automation\n            programs for banks aimed at their institutional\n            strengthening and privatization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Financial Institutions Development\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland -
