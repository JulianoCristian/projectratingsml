The Project used the provision of urban\n            infrastructure finance to leverage municipal management\n            improvements and introduced a new line of credit with\n            quasi-market lending terms and conditions. Its design was\n            based upon the Parana Municipal Development Project (Ln.\n            3100-BR) appraised four months earlier, but implemented in\n            quite different circumstances. Similar follow-on projects\n            were later approved for the states of Minas Gerais (Ln.\n            3639-BR) and Bahia (Ln.4140-BR). Tlhe project's\n            objectives were to: (i) improve the managerial and\n            institutional capacity and fiscal efficiency of RGS\n            municipalities and state agencies. (ii) Provide basic\n            economic and social infrastructure in urban areas. (iii)\n            Decentralize urban administration and financial management.\n            (iv) Improve targeting of urban programs to lower-income\n            populations. (v) Create and strengthen a State urban\n            development fund (FUNDOPIMES). In support of these\n            objectives, Bank Loan proceeds were on-lent to\n            municipalities, their water companies, and the RGS water\n            company, CORSAN, to finance their priority investments. In\n            addition, intemal management improvements were to be carried\n            out. Moreover, the rigorous terms and conditions of\n            FUNDOPIMES' lending were themselves an incentive for\n            municipalities to reform their finances in order to be able\n            to service their project debts comfortably. The kind of\n            investments foreseen under the project included street\n            paving, drainage, basic sanitation, day care centers and\n            health posts. PIMES supported municipal efforts to improve\n            their management directly through its institutional\n            development (ID) component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Municipal
