Some lessons\n            learned included: in the case of this project, the\n            possibility of issues with procurement had been identified\n            up front, and actions expected to mitigate potential delays\n            had been prepared. Effectiveness delays, taken here to mean\n            delays of more than six months in loan effectiveness\n            following approval, are increasingly commonplace in\n            countries that require legislative approval of external\n            financing. Although the Bank has recently sought to minimize\n            the number of effectiveness conditions as a means of\n            ensuring timely project start-up, the reality is that there\n            is often a long lag in effectiveness pending legislative\n            approval. This fact should be considered in the\n            project's timetable as one in which selected activities\n            could be finalized, thereby permitting earlier loan\n            approval. Monitoring and evaluation should be an integral\n            part of project implementation. This is especially true in\n            projects which focus on institutional capacity\n            strengthening, in support of what in the case of the project\n            was a much broader Government program. Monitoring should not\n            be contracted out in most instances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Second Health Sector\n            Strengthening and Modernization

improve health\n            system performance and financial sustainability by\n            supporting the ongoing policy changes in the health sector\n            in Costa Rica (See also report no. 11986). Most of these\n            changes are part of second-phase reforms in the Costa Rican\n            Social Security Institute (Caja Costarricanse de Seguro\n            Social, or CCSS). There are two project components. The\n            first provides financing to develop the strategies and\n            instruments required to achieve the objectives set forth in\n            the Policy Activity Schedule (PAS) (Annex 2A). The component\n            will be executed through two mechanisms that 1) finance\n            local and foreign consultant services, information systems,\n            the development of supply chain solutions--including\n            e-procurement, equipment for the Basic Health Care Teams\n            (EBAIS), training in health policy, clinical practice and\n            management, and study tours to incorporate international\n            \"best practice\" into the Costa Rican health\n            sector; and 2) allocations to decentralized sub-projects\n            with the hospitals and health areas. The second component\n            supports the development of a monitoring and evaluation\n            system, and includes resources to establish and sustain\n            information, education, and communication campaigns related\n            to the modernization process. Support will also be given for\n            the day-to-day operations of the Project Coordinating Unit\n            assisting in project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Second Health
