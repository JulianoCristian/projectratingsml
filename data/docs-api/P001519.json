There has been excellent cooperation between\n            the Bank and the Reseau National des Chemins (RNCFM) in\n            implementing the project. The Bank consultants provided\n            constant assistance throughout the project period, making a\n            significant contribution in terms of advice and\n            recommendations. The RNCFM strove to implement the project\n            successfully. At the beginning of the period the RNCFM made\n            vigorous efforts to implement the assures envisaged in the\n            financial recovery program formulated since 1982, which\n            augured well for proper start-up of the project. The\n            financial situation improved, and the RNCFM was in a\n            position to itself defray the expenses that would be\n            incurred by its participation in the various potential\n            investment operations. Despite financial and managerial\n            shortcomings, the impact of the project physical improvement\n            is sustainable, but on condition that serious efforts are\n            made by RNCFM and Government to adapt the company to its\n            changed transport market roles, as already stared with a\n            reduction of passenger services. The International\n            Development Association (IDA) financed project has\n            essentially ensured that the railway retains its competitive\n            advantage for freight transport of grains and chromite ore.\n            The simultaneous French investment in new locomotives has\n            provided the essential means for transport of other bulk\n            commodities such as petroleum products."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Third Railway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Third Railway
