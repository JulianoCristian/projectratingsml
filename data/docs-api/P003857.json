In addition, the\n            project will (d) stimulate the production of more low-cost\n            housing by both public and private developers; (e) generate\n            employment at low foreign exchange cost; and (f) strengthen\n            the key institutions in the housing sector, namely Bank\n            Tabungan Negara (BTN) and the National Urban Development\n            Corporation (PERUMNAS). This component will further assist\n            the Office of the State Minister for Housing in developing\n            and monitoring housing sector policies and programs. To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will comprise: (a) a\n            credit line to BTN which would be used to finance a share of\n            total mortgage lending commitments during the last three\n            years of the Fourth National Five-Year Development Plan\n            (Repelita IV); and (b) technical assistance and equipment\n            for BTN, PERUMNAS and the Office of the State Minister for Housing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Housing Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Housing Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/05/740916/indonesia-housing-sector-project","projn":"ID-Housing Sector-114556 -- P003857","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Economics,Urban Services to the Poor,Non Bank Financial Institutions,Housing Finance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926002720"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban housing","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,autonomy,Balance Sheet,Balance\n            Sheets,Bank Indonesia,banking system,cities,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,construction finance,contractual\n            saving,contractual savings,credit\n            line,creditworthiness,current\n            prices,disbursement,employment,Financial\n            Performance,financial policies,financial ratios,Financial\n            Statements,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,Homeownership,Housing,housing construction,Housing\n            Demand,housing finance,housing finance system,housing\n            loans,Housing Policies,Housing Policy,housing supply,income\n            distribution,Income Statements,inflation,inflation\n            rates,institutional development,insurance,insurance\n            companies,interest income,interest rates,Internal\n            Audit,inventory,land speculation,lending institutions,low\n            cost housing,mortgage,mortgage finance,mortgage\n            lending,mortgage loan,mortgage loans,profitability,public\n            housing,public sector,Public Works,resource\n            mobilization,return on equity,Savings,State Banks,technical\n            assistance,Urban Development,urban housing,urban\n            population,urban services,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,autonomy,Balance Sheet,Balance\n            Sheets,Bank Indonesia,banking system,cities,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,construction finance,contractual\n            saving,contractual savings,credit\n            line,creditworthiness,current\n            prices,disbursement,employment,Financial\n            Performance,financial policies,financial ratios,Financial\n            Statements,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,Homeownership,Housing,housing construction,Housing\n            Demand,housing finance,housing finance system,housing\n            loans,Housing Policies,Housing Policy,housing supply,income\n            distribution,Income Statements,inflation,inflation\n            rates,institutional development,insurance,insurance\n            companies,interest income,interest rates,Internal\n            Audit,inventory,land speculation,lending institutions,low\n            cost housing,mortgage,mortgage finance,mortgage\n            lending,mortgage loan,mortgage loans,profitability,public\n            housing,public sector,Public Works,resource\n            mobilization,return on equity,Savings,State Banks,technical\n            assistance,Urban Development,urban housing,urban\n            population,urban services,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"6053"},"facets":{}}}
