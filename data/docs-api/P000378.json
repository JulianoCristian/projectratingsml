The\n            request was submitted by inhabitants and people representing\n            inhabitants of the Nylon zone, Douala, Cameroon. They claim\n            to have been harmed and negatively affected by World Bank\n            activities relating to the above-mentioned Projects. In\n            their letter to the Panel, the Requesters claim that the\n            Projects have led to the destruction of their homes,\n            possessions and resources. They state that, as a consequence\n            of the Projects, about 500 people were forcefully evicted\n            from their homes. They further state that many of these\n            people have been without homes since then. According to the\n            requesters, the Government and local authorities have\n            promised them new houses, but this has not yet happened. The\n            requesters assert that until today no compensation has been\n            paid nor have they received appropriate housing. Under the\n            eligibility criteria of the Panel, the Panel may not\n            investigate Projects for which the loan has been closed or\n            more than 95% disbursed. Furthermore, paragraph 22 of the\n            Panel's Operating Procedures provides that the Panel\n            Chairperson will not register Requests if he or she finds\n            that the Request is without doubt manifestly outside the\n            Panel's mandate. Because the Projects closed,\n            respectively, on June 30, 1988, and June 30, 1994, the Panel\n            is not registering the Request in the Panel's Register,\n            and is advising the Requesters of this decision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Urban Development Project and\n            Second Urban Development Project : notice of receipt of a\n            request for inspection and decision not to register the request"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Urban Development\n            Project and Second Urban Development Project : notice of\n            receipt of a request for inspection and decision not to\n            register the request"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/10/8566556/cameroon-urban-development-project-second-urban-development-project-notice-receipt-request-inspection-decision-not-register-request","projn":"CM-Urban Ii-114400 -- P000378","docty":"Inspection Panel Notice of Registration","subtopic":"m,Access to Finance,Housing & Human Habitats,Banks & Banking Reform,Telecommunications Infrastructure","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Cameroon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020439_20071025092148"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"(Historic)Urban development adjustment","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"appropriate housing, cc, community\n            facilities, COOP, Description, education program,\n            eligibility criteria, families, fiduciary responsibility,\n            financial burden, habitat, homes, houses, housing, iC,\n            income, inhabitants, INTERNATIONAL BANK, ja, Loan,\n            neighborhood, possessions, Receipt, Resettlement, slum,\n            technical assistance, Telephone, Urban Development, wages"}},"owner":"WB Off: Yaounde-Central Africa 1 (AFCC1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"41230"},"729252":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1996/03/729252/cameroon-second-urban-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1996/03/729252/cameroon-second-urban-project","new_url":"1996/03/729252/cameroon-second-urban-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/30/000094946_00110905312320/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/30/000094946_00110905312320/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2999","datestored":"2002-07-23T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1996-03-04T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Second Urban Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The assessment of outcome is\n            unsatisfactory, with an unlikely sustainability. Although\n            the Bank performance is rated satisfactory, its handling of\n            project execution was too permissive regarding compliance\n            with legal covenants, and audit requirements, reflected in\n            the Borrower's deficient performance, whose repeated\n            breaches of loan covenants, included the resettlement\n            failure (despite availability of resources), failure to\n            replenish the special account, and reluctance to follow\n            procurement guidelines. Lessons mostly address the\n            importance of building stakeholders' commitment, and\n            ownership, and, designing sound institutional setup early\n            on. Identified reforms to improve urban sector management,\n            but relinquished in favor of civil works, confirms the\n            absence of Government commitment, an issue which should be\n            agreed prior to loan effectiveness. Furthermore, the\n            ambitious sector program, featuring a combination of\n            physical, and institutional elements, but not consistently\n            linked because of weak strategies and unclear prioritization\n            of actions, hindered even the usually successful physical\n            components. In addition, implementation arrangements -\n            critical at project design, and key conditions to project\n            success - and, performance indicators, were insufficiently\n            considered, which diverted decision-making, and weakened\n            project monitoring, respectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Second Urban
