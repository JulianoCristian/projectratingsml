Project sustainability is likely. Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances were satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include the following: The provinces are capable of\n            implementing education projects of this nature with the\n            overall advice of a Chinese Experts Panel and the guidance\n            and coordination of the Ministry of Education-Foreign\n            Investment and Loan Office; however, institutional\n            development in project management and supervision must be\n            stressed in the project formulation. As in all past\n            education projects, technical assistance and studies receive\n            very little attention until the latter part of the project\n            implementation period; consequently, their impact during the\n            project implementation period is minimal. In this project\n            there were additional difficulties whereby each of the six\n            provinces were to jointly approve terms of reference,\n            contracts, etc., and to make payments of the research group\n            conducting the three studies funded by the project.\n            Development of proper project indicators are essential for\n            the monitoring of the project--both for the physical\n            accomplishments as well as for the project benefits. IDA\n            (International Development Association) should provide more\n            supervision resources for such a geographically dispersed\n            project as this and must ensure the proper implementation of\n            all technical assistance activities early in the project\n            implementation through proper use of conditions and covenants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
