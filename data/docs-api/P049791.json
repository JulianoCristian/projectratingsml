Pakistan has a\n            population of over 162 million, with over 60 percent living\n            in rural areas. Rising food prices, the energy crisis, and\n            other inflationary pressures have not only pushed more\n            people below the poverty line, but have increased\n            vulnerability of the ultra-poor to an unprecedented level.\n            The rising levels of ethnic and religious strife, conflict\n            and insecurity, and recurring natural calamities have\n            further limited the country\u2019s capacity to deal effectively\n            with persistent poverty. The International Development\n            Association financed Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund\n            (PPAF) in 1999 to support government efforts to empower poor\n            people to achieve sustainable livelihoods. The objective was\n            to increase their incomes, improve their productive\n            capacity, and provide them better access to services. The\n            project facilitated the formation of inclusive community\n            groups, with the aim of increasing economic activity, skills\n            enhancement, asset base, infrastructure access, and market\n            linkages. The third PPAF (PPAF III) project was launched in\n            2009, built on successful PPAF experiences and further\n            targeted marginalized groups of the most vulnerable and\n            poorest households, including women. PPAF III promoted\n            stronger community institutions, particularly their ability\n            to manage their own development and to access services.\n            Access to social and physical infrastructure were fully\n            integrated to maximize the impact on poverty. Furthermore,\n            there was a major effort to provide increased occupational\n            skills training, with the goal of spurring exponential\n            growth in micro-enterprises."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Rural communities push back poverty"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Rural communities push\n            back poverty"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2009/09/25137046/pakistan-rural-communities-push-back-poverty","count":"Pakistan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Health and other social services,Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"skills, sanitation, communities,\n            micro-credit, rural producers, community institutions,\n            poverty line, farmland, impact on poverty, villages, skills\n            training, teachers, schools, income poverty, income, gender,\n            education services, homes, community organizations, groups,\n            rural access, information, services, rural poverty, incomes,\n            micro- finance institutions, health, poor people,\n            malnutrition, rural, projects, project, habitat, gender\n            disparities, market, access to markets, rural poor,\n            conflict, literacy, land, education, drinking water,\n            investment, rural households, irrigation, participatory\n            development, training, micro- finance, households, access to\n            services, rural areas, poverty, clean water, livelihood\n            opportunities, access to health facilities, community\n            groups, facilities, girls, students, houses, funding,\n            markets, poor rural households, drainage, livelihoods, poor,\n            community, women, research, food prices, history, rural\n            roads, female, districts, poverty alleviation, human development"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financial Intermediary Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","projn":"PK-Second Poverty Alleviation Fund Project\n            -- P082977,PK-Poverty Alleviation Fund -- P049791","topic":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Poverty m1326687 695,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis\n            m1327421 709,Monitoring and Evaluation Systems m1326029 1156,Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Evidence-Based Policy m1326939 706","subtopic":"Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Primary Education,Rural Poverty Reduction,Housing & Human Habitats","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Education","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083135b9a_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Gender,Rural markets,Improving labor markets,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Gender","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Poverty m1326687 695,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis\n            m1327421 709,Monitoring and Evaluation Systems m1326029 1156,Inequality and Shared Prosperity m1327655 700,Evidence-Based Policy m1326939 706","owner":"Finance & Markets - GP - IBRD (GFMDR)","trustfund":"TF023107-PHRD-FINANCIAL SEC.

These include: 1) needing a holistic approach to\n            improve access to services and reduce poverty which combines\n            micro-credit with small scale infrastructure, education, and\n            health facilities as well as skill development; 2) autonomy\n            and freedom from political pressures; 3) the need for\n            Institutional development of pro-poor institutions,\n            including strategic reviews, SWOT (strength, weaknesses,\n            opportunities and threats) analysis, mandatory submissions\n            of business plans, targeted training, capacity building of\n            staff, and strengthening of financial and monitoring\n            functions; 4) the ability of decentralization to enable\n            organizations to respond rapidly and successfully to\n            community needs; 5) the hiring of staff by PPAF through a\n            transparent and merit based procedures with policies of\n            compensation and staff development clearly articulated and\n            reviewed to keep staff motivated; and 6) making program\n            interventions demand driven.  Other key lessons cited are:\n            Government support is absolutely essential for the success\n            of the apex institution. The level of donor support and\n            facilitation, or the absence of it, can make or break the\n            project. A competent and committed Board of Directors makes\n            the task at hand much easier. A fully competent Chief\n            Executive can achieve better and quicker results. Building\n            of trust is the key to achieving sustainable development.\n            Development is an on-going process which is continually evolving."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Poverty Alleviation Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Poverty Alleviation\n            Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/5869168/pakistan-poverty-alleviation-fund-project","projn":"PK-Poverty Alleviation Fund -- P049791","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Community Development and Empowerment,Poverty Assessment,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050617101716"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage,Water supply,Roads and highways,Other social services,Micro- and SME finance","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Health and other social services,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Autonomy, Bank Performance, Bank\n            supervision, beneficiaries, capacity building, Capital\n            adequacy, case studies, civil society, commercial banks,\n            commercial credit, communities, Community Infrastructure,\n            community infrastructure projects, community members,\n            Community Organization, community organizations, community\n            participation, CPI, Currency Unit, Data collection,\n            Decentralization, drinking water, economic growth, economies\n            of scale, effective use, eligibility criteria, enhancing\n            quality, Exchange Rate, Expenditure Category, expenditures,\n            field visits, financial management, Financial ratio,\n            financial sustainability, FISCAL YEAR, flexibility, good\n            governance, governance structure, government commitment,\n            Government Securities, household income, housing, ICR,\n            Impact Assessment, impact evaluation, Impact Indicators,\n            IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT, implementing agency,\n            income, income households, Institutional Development,\n            Interest margin, intermediaries, internal controls, Internal\n            monitoring, intervention, learning, Lessons Learned, lessons\n            learnt, livelihood, livelihoods, local councils, local\n            government, local level, long term, market distortions,\n            Ministries of Finance, needs assessment, NGO, O&M,\n            operating costs, Output Indicators, outreach, political\n            patronage, poor households, POVERTY ALLEVIATION, poverty\n            alleviation programs, Poverty Reduction, poverty reduction\n            programs, Poverty Reduction Strategy, poverty targeting,\n            Present Value, procurement, productivity, profitability,\n            Program interventions, Project Appraisal, project\n            beneficiaries, Project Implementation, project management,\n            project preparation, public policy, public sector, reducing\n            poverty, Return on Equity, Return on Investment, risk\n            management, savings, service delivery, short term, social\n            development, social funds, social indicators, social\n            services, social status, State Bank of Pakistan, sustainable\n            development, sustainable livelihoods, targeting, team\n            members, technical assistance, technical support,\n            transparency, urban areas, urban poor, urban services, Water\n            supply, write offs"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financial Intermediary Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF023107-PHRD-FINANCIAL SEC.
