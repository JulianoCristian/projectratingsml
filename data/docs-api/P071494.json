The\n            ratings for the Universal Basic Education Project (UBEP) of\n            Nigeria are as follows: outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was significant; Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory; and also the performance of the Borrower was\n            rated unsatisfactory. The main lessons from the experience\n            of PEP2 and UBEP are as follows: 1) good performance during\n            implementation cannot make up for fundamental design flaws\n            in a project in which component activities are not well\n            aligned with the project development objectives (PDOs). UBEP\n            suffered from too much complexity and spread limited\n            resources too thinly among the 16 states and numerous\n            federal agencies. The states did not have the capacity to\n            implement such a complex design and spreading the resources\n            too thinly did not allow for reaching the critical mass\n            needed to have a catalytic impact upon the system; 2) lack\n            of readiness for implementation cannot be compensated for by\n            imposing many conditions of effectiveness. In hindsight the\n            UBEP was not really ready to start implementation at the\n            time of Board approval and the introduction of conditions of\n            effectiveness could not make up for this lack of readiness;\n            3) technical assistance (TA) needs to be closely aligned\n            with the project development objectives and institutional\n            capacity gaps, and closely supervised by the Bank and\n            co-financiers to prevent it from drifting away from PDOs.\n            Although the TA was implemented by the Department for\n            International Development (DFID) contractors, the Bank did\n            not exercise close monitoring and evaluation initially. The\n            broadly stated TOR led the TA providers to focus initially\n            on school development and not on the strategic management\n            competencies needed to manage a Bank supported project; and\n            4) effective monitoring and evaluation of learning outcomes\n            require a long lead time to design and develop and thus need\n            to be addressed early in project design along with PDOs. A\n            major shortcoming in the UBEP design was its failure to\n            build upon the measures of learning assessment built into\n            PEP2. Learning assessments, or other measures for monitoring\n            quality of outcomes, can be used to feed back into the\n            improvement of curriculum, teaching and school management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Second Primary Education Project;\n            and Universal Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Second Primary\n

Project\n            is expected to be minor. However, some subprojects may\n            require land acquisition and resettlement activities,\n            leading to loss of productive assets, and production, thus\n            requiring compensation. In accordance with the\n            country's legal framework, and the Bank's\n            operational directive on involuntary resettlement, this\n            resettlement policy framework provides the measures to\n            minimize adverse impacts as follows. Project affected people\n            (PAP) will be eligible for compensation due to: a) loss of\n            agricultural land, through the provision of land-for-land\n            compensation of equal productive capacity; however, if PAP\n            so wishes, cash compensation at full replacement cost will\n            be available, provided the portion of land lost represents\n            20 percent or less of the total area of landholding. Loss of\n            standing crops, including labor invested in planted crops,\n            and fruit or industrial trees, will be compensated at market\n            prices. Land temporarily lost due to construction works,\n            will be compensated for income losses, standing crops, and\n            for the cost of soil restoration, and damaged\n            infrastructure; b) residential land, and structures will be\n            compensated at replacement costs of equivalent size, and,\n            cash compensation will reflect the full replacement cost of\n            structures without depreciation. Land/structures partially\n            affected, where remaining residential land will not be\n            sufficient for rebuilding, compensation will be at full\n            replacement cost without depreciation. Tenants will be\n            compensated with a six month rental fee cash grant, at\n            prevailing market rates, assisted with alternative\n            accommodations; c) Business losses will be compensated\n            through alternative business sites, or cash compensations\n            for lost business structures, and income losses during the\n            transition period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -

Environmental impacts are likely to involve soil\n            erosion, and loss of flora, and fauna at borrow pits; soil,\n            and water pollution at construction sites; and, degradation\n            due to improper latrines, and water points site selection.\n            It is proposed that the position of an Environmental Desk\n            Officer be created in participating states, to asses, and\n            build environmental capacity, while communities will be\n            responsible for the environmental screening of schools'\n            rehabilitation, through the use of screening lists; guidance\n            on environmental categories; use of environmental\n            guidelines, and checklists to identify, and prepare\n            mitigation measures; and, procedures for rehabilitation\n            proposals requiring environmental assessment. Mitigation\n            measures are as follows. Appropriate sanitation technology\n            will be selected for the provision, and maintenance of\n            latrines, as well as for the location of water points, while\n            water quality testing will be conducted by the State\n            Ministry of Works and Housing. Daily cleaning, and control\n            at construction sites will be enforced, including provision\n            of adequate waste disposal services, which includes disposal\n            of chemicals, and hazardous materials at specific sites,\n            dust control, and regular drainage clean-up. Re-vegetation\n            practices, and physical stabilization should contain soil\n            degradation, while aquifer studies will be conducted to\n            prevent water contamination, wildlife disturbance, and loss\n            of vegetation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
