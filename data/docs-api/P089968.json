Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to entrust implementation of a post-disaster operation to a\n            well established agency, with good knowledge of Bank\n            procedures and adequate procurement and financial management\n            capacity. ADETIP (National Executing Agency for Public Works\n            - Agence Djiboutienne d'Execution des Travaux\n            d'Interet Public) did a good job in coordinating\n            implementation of a large number of components. The lack of\n            government reaction to the encroachment on public domain in\n            a sensitive area is puzzling and needs to be discussed\n            within the country dialogue context. Sooner or later, the\n            Government will have to address the problem, hopefully\n            before a severe flood. The Bank policy on involuntary\n            resettlement is difficult to accept by governments in\n            countries where squatters include illegal immigrants from\n            neighboring countries. They consider it as too generous and\n            are afraid of creating precedents. This is a sensitive issue\n            which should be discussed openly with the recipient\n            countries. Sustainability of the dike and of the\n            surveillance system is a major issue. The Bank hired a\n            consultant to review this issue and make appropriate\n            recommendations. This was most useful. It is important now\n            to sensitize key stakeholders to the findings and\n            recommendations of the report.

The main benefits would be the restoration of\n            services, through the rehabilitation of roads, bridges,\n            flood control works, health centers, and schools. Despite\n            its benefits, possible risks include: a) institutional\n            overlap and lack of coordination in the Ambouli Oued\n            rehabilitation project among government ministries, and\n            donor agencies, but mitigation measures include expansion of\n            the Djiboutian Agency for Implementation of Publics Works -\n            ADETIP - through the steering committee to ensure government\n            coordination among line ministries and agencies, and,\n            coordination with th European Union (EU), the United Nations\n            Development Programme (UNDP) and the African Development\n            Bank (AfDB); b) minor relocation and resettlement risks as a\n            result of the Oued rehabilitation project; mitigation\n            includes that as a condition for the no-objection to proceed\n            with the Oued rehabilitation component, the Bank requested\n            that the protection dyke design and the widening/leveling of\n            the Oued riverbed, avoid - to the maximum extent possible -\n            the relocation of housing structures, and/or economic\n            activities, and that a resettlement compensation plan be\n            designed appropriately; c) the selling by flood victims of\n            their lands and houses prompted the following mitigation\n            measures: a rapid socio-economic study will be conducted to\n            determine the extent of flood victims' willingness to\n            remain in place, although the proximity to Port Doraleh, and\n            its benefiting from several donor-financed projects, makes\n            it a more viable, livable place.
