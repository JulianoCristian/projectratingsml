It will also\n            strengthen the management and technical skills of those\n            institutions involved  in the program. The project will\n            represent a significant step in helping the Chilean\n            Government to address the problems affecting small and\n            medium scale industry, and will promote the participation of\n            selected commercial banks, thus enabling many small and\n            medium scale industries to have access to the banking\n            system.  The project will also help potential exporters to\n            find foreign markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Small and Medium Industry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile - Small and Medium Industry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/07/741234/chile-small-medium-industry-project","projn":"CL-Small & Med Ind -- P006617","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Environment","count":"Chile","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970723102228"},"subsc":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise-IL","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,agriculture,assets,Auditing,Balance\n            Sheets,banking sector,Banking System,Budgetary\n            support,capital base,Capital Formation,capital goods,Central\n            Bank,Commercial banks,commercial\n            credit,competitiveness,Consumer Price Index,CPI,credit\n            risk,debt,demand deposits,economic problems,Economic Rate of\n            Return,economic resources,Employment,equity capital,equity\n            investments,Exchange rate,expenditures,exports,feasibility\n            studies,financial assets,financial crisis,financial\n            institutions,Financial Intermediaries,financial\n            intermediation,financial planning,financial\n            restructuring,financial sector,fiscal year,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,GOVERNMENT BANKS,Gross Domestic\n            Product,high unemployment,import\n            tariffs,imports,Income,Income Statements,interest\n            rate,interest rates,labor force,labor\n            productivity,liquidity,loan financing,low interest\n            rates,macroeconomic policies,maturities,mortgages,net\n            worth,operating costs,overvaluation,ownership\n            structure,policy environment,productivity,public\n            enterprises,real interest\n            rate,recapitalization,savings,securities,Structural\n            Adjustment,Structural\n            Change,subsidiaries,subsidiary,Technical\n            Assistance,telecommunications,transport,unemployment,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,agriculture,assets,Auditing,Balance\n            Sheets,banking sector,Banking System,Budgetary\n            support,capital base,Capital Formation,capital goods,Central\n            Bank,Commercial banks,commercial\n            credit,competitiveness,Consumer Price Index,CPI,credit\n            risk,debt,demand deposits,economic problems,Economic Rate of\n            Return,economic resources,Employment,equity capital,equity\n            investments,Exchange rate,expenditures,exports,feasibility\n            studies,financial assets,financial crisis,financial\n            institutions,Financial Intermediaries,financial\n            intermediation,financial planning,financial\n            restructuring,financial sector,fiscal year,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,GOVERNMENT BANKS,Gross Domestic\n            Product,high unemployment,import\n            tariffs,imports,Income,Income Statements,interest\n            rate,interest rates,labor force,labor\n            productivity,liquidity,loan financing,low interest\n            rates,macroeconomic policies,maturities,mortgages,net\n            worth,operating costs,overvaluation,ownership\n            structure,policy environment,productivity,public\n            enterprises,real interest\n            rate,recapitalization,savings,securities,Structural\n            Adjustment,Structural\n            Change,subsidiaries,subsidiary,Technical\n            Assistance,telecommunications,transport,unemployment,working capital"}},"owner":"WB Off:Buenos Aires-Southrn Cone (LCC7C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"5579"},"facets":{}}}
