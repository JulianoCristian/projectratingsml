The lessons\n            learned indicate that institutional change processes are\n            difficult and will encounter resistance. Political will is\n            critical to effect institutional change and must be\n            carefully managed through election turnovers. Institutional\n            change processes cannot be included as a small subcomponent\n            in a 2-3 year project but must be core project objectives or\n            provided in a separate project. Supporting mechanisms to\n            increase accountability and transparency of local\n            governments (e.g. private sector associations, media, NGOs,\n            council committees, communities) are key to ensuring an\n            early warning system and to improving commitment to reform\n            local finances and service delivery, especially through\n            election changes. Maintenance for large investments is tied\n            up with overall financial management (expenditure and\n            revenues) of municipality and cannot be treated as wholly\n            separate. With proper planning, supervision and monitoring,\n            the private sector can provide better quality services more\n            competitively in certain service areas. Basic management\n            techniques and systems are critical inputs to improving\n            performance and accountability and need to be\n            institutionalized early on in project life. Projects of this\n            nature and scale can be properly managed by local\n            consultants with limited support from international consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -  Nakivubo Channel Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda -

Project for Uganda,\n            which includes deepening and widening the main stormwater\n            drainage channel in Kampala in order to accommodate the\n            1-in-10-year return period storm flow. These are the adverse\n            environmental impacts and mitigation measures. Construction\n            will likely cause damage to some of the flora and fauna in\n            the area, soil erosion, and adverse aesthetic impacts. Also,\n            the transport of substantial volumes of materials to and\n            from the construction site will cause noise, dust, traffic\n            disruption, and adverse aesthetic impacts. Limiting the work\n            areas to be cleared ahead of construction, and revegetating\n            bank slopes will arrest vegetal removal and the resulting\n            loss of fauna habitat as well as soil erosion. Also,\n            excavated areas below flood water levels will be treated and\n            stone gabions and mattresses used. A traffic management plan\n            including details of lane closures and bridges to be closed,\n            proposed diversions, durations of interruptions, time\n            restrictions on vehicular movements, and construction of\n            footbridges will mitigate traffic disruption. To minimize\n            flooding during channel construction, the contract documents\n            will include restrictions on construction during the rainy\n            season and the use of diversionary works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Nakivubo Channel Rehabilitation\n            Project - environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Nakivubo Channel\n            Rehabilitation Project - environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/02/440991/uganda-nakivubo-channel-rehabilitation-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"UG-Nakivubo Channel Rehab Sil (Fy99) -- P059223","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Water Supply and Systems,Roads & Highways,Water Conservation,Earth Sciences & GIS","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Uganda","authors":{"authr":"Kampala City Council"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99061105313271"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Sub-national government administration,Flood protection","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aesthetics,batteries,blockage,bridge,bridge\n            widening,carrying capacity,cars,catchment,catchment\n            area,Channel,channels,clay,Compaction,Concrete,concrete\n            pipes,Conservation,Construction,covering,culverts,debris,discharge,Diversion,drain,DRAINAGE,Drainage\n            Areas,drainage\n            system,drains,earth,Effluent,engineering,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            MANAGEMENT,Erosion,export,farmers,fishing,flood plain,flood\n            plains,flooding,flooding\n            problems,Flora,footbridges,footpaths,FRAMEWORK,fuel,hills,intersections,Lake\n            Victoria,Land acquisition,land development,Land\n            Use,lines,local authorities,main\n            roads,masonry,pavement,pedestrian bridges,pedestrian\n            crossings,pedestrians,pipe,pipes,point,point\n            sources,Police,pollution,ponding,precast\n            concrete,Rainfall,rainy season,reinforced concrete,retaining\n            walls,return period,Ridging,road\n            surface,roads,Roundabouts,runoff,screens,silt,silting,Soil,Soil\n            Compaction,Soil Erosion,Soils,spring,springs,stone,storm\n            water,Streets,Structures,Surface Water,Surface Water\n            Monitoring,swamps,terrain,topography,Traffic,traffic\n            congestion,traffic flow,transport,Vegetation,vehicles,water\n            drainage,water level,Water Quality,Water Resources,water\n            services,water table,west,wetlands,wire"},"1":{"cdata!":"aesthetics,batteries,blockage,bridge,bridge\n            widening,carrying capacity,cars,catchment,catchment\n            area,Channel,channels,clay,Compaction,Concrete,concrete\n            pipes,Conservation,Construction,covering,culverts,debris,discharge,Diversion,drain,DRAINAGE,Drainage\n            Areas,drainage\n            system,drains,earth,Effluent,engineering,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            MANAGEMENT,Erosion,export,farmers,fishing,flood plain,flood\n            plains,flooding,flooding\n            problems,Flora,footbridges,footpaths,FRAMEWORK,fuel,hills,intersections,Lake\n            Victoria,Land acquisition,land development,Land\n            Use,lines,local authorities,main\n            roads,masonry,pavement,pedestrian bridges,pedestrian\n            crossings,pedestrians,pipe,pipes,point,point\n            sources,Police,pollution,ponding,precast\n            concrete,Rainfall,rainy season,reinforced concrete,retaining\n            walls,return period,Ridging,road\n            surface,roads,Roundabouts,runoff,screens,silt,silting,Soil,Soil\n            Compaction,Soil Erosion,Soils,spring,springs,stone,storm\n            water,Streets,Structures,Surface Water,Surface Water\n            Monitoring,swamps,terrain,topography,Traffic,traffic\n            congestion,traffic flow,transport,Vegetation,vehicles,water\n            drainage,water level,Water Quality,Water Resources,water\n            services,water table,west,wetlands,wire"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Anglophone (AFTU1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF040216-UGANDA - SUPERVISION OF URBAN\n            DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT PROJECTS,TF037946-UGANDA - NAKIVUBO CHANNEL\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT","repnb":"E263"},"facets":{}}}
