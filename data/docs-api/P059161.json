Some lessons learned included: the\n            case of Mexico City has demonstrated that the creation of an\n            enabling environment is necessary before sustainable\n            measures can be implemented. The adequate regulatory,\n            institutional and technical frameworks were in place before\n            starting construction and provide a solid base for the\n            expansion of the system. Specifically the creation of a\n            stable institution for the management of the corridor, the\n            involvement of private bus operators, the new regulatory\n            framework under which services are being provided, and the\n            structuring of an integrated fare represented success\n            factors in the development of Metrobus. Further field\n            testing of bus technologies is needed for defining emission\n            standards and for the decision-making process on alternative\n            bus technologies for public transport. The field test has\n            provided helpful data for the operation of alternative bus\n            technologies under real conditions at Mexico City's\n            altitude. However, because the test fleet consisted of only\n            a few vehicles per type and in many cases for advanced\n            technologies a single vehicle was tested, further field\n            testing is needed to strengthen the database for decision\n            making on bus technologies for public transport with major\n            emission reduction potentials."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Introduction of Climate Friendly\n            Measures in Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Introduction of Climate\n

Therefore, in the medium and\n            long term the Federal District Government needs to implement\n            a comprehensive reform of urban transport system that favors\n            efficiency and at the same time upkeeps environmental\n            benefits. The paper points out the relevance of this\n            argument when it is realized that 81 percent of the\n            population travel by mass transit while only 19 percent use\n            private vehicles. This raises the need for a transport\n            system based on a design of strategic corridors of the main\n            roads in Mexico City, that will result in a mass transit\n            alternative that contributes to the improvement of both the\n            public transport system and the metropolitan environment in general."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pruebas en campo de autobuses de tecnolog\u00edas\n            alternativas en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pruebas en campo de autobuses de\n            tecnolog\u00edas alternativas en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/05/12837576/pruebas-en-campo-de-autobuses-de-tecnolog\u00edas-alternativas-en-la-ciudad-de-m\u00e9xico","projn":"MX-Introduction Of Climate Friendly Measures\n            In Transport -- P059161","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Urban Transport,Roads & Highways,Montreal Protocol,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Working Paper","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20101006094326"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General transportation sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Air,air pollution,Air Quality,Air Quality\n            Management,altitude,atmosphere,benefit analysis,bicycle\n            parking,bicycles,bus,bus line,bus operators,bus\n            transport,buses,car\n            park,carbon,cars,Chemistry,Climate,climate\n            change,commuters,concessions,diesel\n            vehicles,driving,emissions,fares,Forestry,framework,fuel,fuel\n            efficiency,greenhouse gas,greenhouse gas\n            emissions,Indigenous Peoples,land use,managers,Metro\n            system,metropolitan areas,mode of transport,modes of\n            transport,motorized transport,operating costs,public\n            transport,public transport efficiency,public transport\n            sector,quality control,routes,Safeguard Policies,safeguard\n            policy,safety awareness,Safety Management,Safety of\n            Dams,schools,social issues,technical\n            assistance,traffic,traffic safety,Transport,transport\n            planning,transport policy,transport projects,transport\n            sector,Transportation,urban development,urban growth,waste"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"trustfund":"BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF022844-GEF2:MEXICO SECOND AIR QUALITY PROJECT,TF027081-PHRD-URBAN TRANSPORT & AIR\n            QUALITY MANAGEMENT,TF038513-MEXICO:  AIR QUALITY AND\n            TRANSPORT II,TF051612-GEF2 FSP -MEXICO:CLIMATE\n            FRIENDLY MEASURES IN TRANSPORT PROJECT","repnb":"56940","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Pruebas en campo de autobuses de\n            tecnolog\u00edas alternativas en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico"}}},"6753492":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/04/6753492/mexico-climate-friendly-measures-transport-gef-project-procurement-plan-mexico-climate-friendly-measures-transport-gef-project-procurement-plan","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/04/6753492/mexico-climate-friendly-measures-transport-gef-project-procurement-plan-mexico-climate-friendly-measures-transport-gef-project-procurement-plan","new_url":"2006/04/6753492/mexico-climate-friendly-measures-transport-gef-project-procurement-plan-mexico-climate-friendly-measures-transport-gef-project-procurement-plan","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/04/27/000012009_20060427085351/Rendered/INDEX/359790rev0pdf.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/04/27/000012009_20060427085351/Rendered/PDF/359790rev0pdf.pdf","docdt":"2006-04-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2006-04-27T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

To\n            this end, the components include: 1) rationalization of\n            sector strategies on air quality issues, through the\n            revision of plans, and through workshops on integrated\n            environment and transport issues. This component will\n            support the design, development, and monitoring of the\n            Metropolitan Climate Change Action Plan for Transport in the\n            MCMA; 2) definition of an enabling environment, to\n            facilitate the implementation of sustainable transport\n            strategies, through a revision of institutional frameworks,\n            that includes integration of metro and bus transport, reform\n            of bus regulations, particularly regarding quality control\n            of the corridors system, business and management structure\n            on corridor operations, and measures to promote increased\n            numbers of metro customers; 3) field tests of\n            climate-friendly high capacity vehicles, through comparative\n            tests for alternative bus/fuel technologies; 4) technical\n            assistance, and training to integrate climate change, and\n            air quality considerations in the design, and analysis of\n            transport strategies, supported by cost-benefit analysis of\n            sustainable transport projects, with environmental\n            considerations; 5) public awareness and information\n            dissemination, to sensitize communities on the benefits of\n            new transportation modes, in addition to workshops to\n            increase stakeholder
