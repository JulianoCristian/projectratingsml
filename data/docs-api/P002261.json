Conditions\n            internal and external to Rwanda affected project\n            development, impact, and success. Throughout the\n            project's life, Rwanda experienced political\n            instability, internal and regional insecurity, and suffered\n            from a lack of institutional capacity. The lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) Post-conflict environments\n            necessitate malleable project designs in order to be able to\n            adapt to the often rapidly changing conditions as to what is\n            feasible and what is desirable. 2) Speed and ownership are a\n            regular trade-off for interventions in a post-conflict\n            environment. In an emergency period, implementation through\n            an independent agency may be most efficient as long as local\n            capacities are too weak to carry out such activities. 3)\n            Projects in post-conflict countries should pay particular\n            attention to financial management. Weak government capacity\n            and the lack of adequate financial controls require the\n            close monitoring of funds. 4) Micro-credit activities, which\n            by nature require some level of stability within the\n            environment they are implemented, may not be appropriate in\n            post-conflict environments. 5) Monitoring and evaluation\n            should be conducted regularly so as to be able to make snap\n            decisions and respond expediently to matters in a changing\n            and sometimes volatile environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Food Security and Social Action Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Food Security and Social\n            Action Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1490108/rwanda-food-security-social-action-project","projn":"RW-- Food Security -- P002261","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Research,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Rwanda","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01071304102340"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adaptation,audits,Bank\n            Performance,beneficiary assessment,capacity\n            building,clinics,Community development,community\n            level,community members,country conditions,Currency\n            Unit,decentralization,developed\n            countries,development,economic\n            conditions,education,employment,ethnicity,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,families,financial institutions,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,Food insecurity,food production,Food\n            Security,health,health centers,Human\n            Development,income,increased\n            emphasis,indicators,Institutional\n            Development,inventory,iron,key performance indicators,labor\n            force,living standards,local administration,local\n            government,local level,local levels,malnutrition,mass\n            migration,migration,national levels,nutrition\n            education,Participatory research,Participatory research\n            methods,partnership,population groups,poverty\n            alleviation,poverty reduction,prefectures,primary\n            school,public expenditures,recurrent costs,refugees,research\n            methods,rural areas,rural roads,safety,safety\n            net,schools,Social Assistance,social capital,social\n            services,social welfare,Structural Adjustment,technical\n            assistance,transport,UNDP,United Nations,urban\n            poverty,victims,violence,vulnerable groups,water\n            supply,widows,workers,working conditions"},"1":{"cdata!":"adaptation,audits,Bank\n            Performance,beneficiary assessment,capacity\n            building,clinics,Community development,community\n            level,community members,country conditions,Currency\n            Unit,decentralization,developed\n            countries,development,economic\n            conditions,education,employment,ethnicity,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,families,financial institutions,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,Food insecurity,food production,Food\n            Security,health,health centers,Human\n            Development,income,increased\n            emphasis,indicators,Institutional\n            Development,inventory,iron,key performance indicators,labor\n            force,living standards,local administration,local\n            government,local level,local levels,malnutrition,mass\n            migration,migration,national levels,nutrition\n            education,Participatory research,Participatory research\n            methods,partnership,population groups,poverty\n            alleviation,poverty reduction,prefectures,primary\n            school,public expenditures,recurrent costs,refugees,research\n            methods,rural areas,rural roads,safety,safety\n            net,schools,Social Assistance,social capital,social\n            services,social welfare,Structural Adjustment,technical\n            assistance,transport,UNDP,United Nations,urban\n            poverty,victims,violence,vulnerable groups,water\n            supply,widows,workers,working conditions"}},"owner":"AFT: HD4 Trust Fund Admin (AFTH4)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.

The objectives of the project are to :\n            a) improve the food security and social welfare of the\n            poorest population groups; b) improve the Government's\n            capability to monitor living standards; and c) initiate a\n            long-term poverty alleviation strategy.  The project\n            includes four components. The food aid and nutrition\n            component aims at reducing food insecurity and malnutrition\n            through food aid purchased locally and targeted at\n            vulnerable groups (orphans, AIDS afflicted households,\n            pregnant and lactating women, and children); coordinated\n            emergency food relief; and support for a national food\n            policy.  The labor based works component will increase the\n            purchasing power of the population of the 43 poorest\n            communes in the country through community-based works\n            including: i) communal road rehabilitation; ii) anti-erosion\n            and land improvement measures such as reforestation; and\n            iii) other public works.  The micro-enterprise promotion and\n            development component will: a) promote the creation of\n            profitable micro-enterprises in rural areas; and b) identify\n            potential entrepreneurs. Finally, the social surveys\n            component will aim at strengthening the government's\n            capacities to monitor living standards through surveys and\n            studies and to

The objectives of the project are to :\n            a) improve the food security and social welfare of the\n            poorest population groups; b) improve the Government's\n            capability to monitor living standards; and c) initiate a\n            long-term poverty alleviation strategy.  The project\n            includes four components. The food aid and nutrition\n            component aims at reducing food insecurity and malnutrition\n            through food aid purchased locally and targeted at\n            vulnerable groups (orphans, AIDS afflicted households,\n            pregnant and lactating women, and children); coordinated\n            emergency food relief; and support for a national food\n            policy.  The labor based works component will increase the\n            purchasing power of the population of the 43 poorest\n            communes in the country through community-based works\n            including: i) communal road rehabilitation; ii) anti-erosion\n            and land improvement measures such as reforestation; and\n            iii) other public works.  The micro-enterprise promotion and\n            development component will: a) promote the creation of\n            profitable micro-enterprises in rural areas; and b) identify\n            potential entrepreneurs. Finally, the social surveys\n            component will aim at strengthening the government's\n            capacities to monitor living standards through surveys and\n            studies and to elaborate relevant social policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Food Security and Social Action Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Food Security and Social\n            Action Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/05/735517/rwanda-food-security-social-action-project","projn":"RW-- Food Security -- P002261","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Health Economics & Finance,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Rwanda","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961002084240"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,arable\n            land,audits,autonomy,balance of payments,capacity\n            building,capital grants,Cd,climate,commercial\n            banks,commodities,conditionality,current\n            prices,Debt,demographic\n            growth,deposits,devaluation,development policies,development\n            strategies,economic growth,economic life,economic\n            projections,employment,ethnic groups,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,exports,financial\n            sector,Forestry,GDP,girls,GNP,growth rate,health care,import\n            quotas,imports,income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,Institutional Development,interest rate,interest\n            rates,legal framework,legislation,local\n            governments,malaria,malnutrition,marketing,medicines,migration,monopolies,mortality,natural\n            resources,per capita income,population growth,Poverty\n            alleviation,private sector,profit margins,property\n            rights,public expenditures,public health,public\n            sector,public services,refugees,regulatory\n            framework,resource allocation,resources\n            management,safety,sustainable growth,Terms of\n            Trade,transport,urban areas,urban development,violence,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,arable\n            land,audits,autonomy,balance of payments,capacity\n            building,capital grants,Cd,climate,commercial\n            banks,commodities,conditionality,current\n            prices,Debt,demographic\n            growth,deposits,devaluation,development policies,development\n            strategies,economic growth,economic life,economic\n            projections,employment,ethnic groups,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,exports,financial\n            sector,Forestry,GDP,girls,GNP,growth rate,health care,import\n            quotas,imports,income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,Institutional Development,interest rate,interest\n            rates,legal framework,legislation,local\n            governments,malaria,malnutrition,marketing,medicines,migration,monopolies,mortality,natural\n            resources,per capita income,population growth,Poverty\n            alleviation,private sector,profit margins,property\n            rights,public expenditures,public health,public\n            sector,public services,refugees,regulatory\n            framework,resource allocation,resources\n            management,safety,sustainable growth,Terms of\n            Trade,transport,urban areas,urban development,violence,Water Supply"}},"owner":"AFT: HD4 Trust Fund Admin (AFTH4)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
