The\n            lessons learned indicate that the outcome of both projects\n            is obviously not satisfactory to the Bank, and in many ways\n            it is not satisfactory to the client governments involved\n            either. The objective of the projects was to change behavior\n            of private and public agents in the use of the natural\n            resources of tropical rain forests. The project concept did\n            not recognize the strong existing economic and political\n            forces that were (and still are) working in favor of\n            continued expansion of forest clearing - the \"political\n            economy\" of the frontier states. In the strive for\n            decentralization after POLONOROESTE, state governments\n            became the principal partners and executors of the projects.\n            At the risk of undue simplification, the Bank had a strong\n            interest in the environmental objectives of the projects, in\n            the aftermath of POLONOROESTE (Northwest Integrated\n            Development Program), but saw development - in the right\n            places - as part of an overall strategy. The state\n            governments (and their societies) were much more interested\n            in development, particularly infrastructure. In spite of\n            formally approved initial zoning laws, there was no\n            sufficiently deep commitment on the part of the states'\n            society to be bound by the provisions of (first\n            approximation) zoning. Refined (second approximation) zoning\n            came too late to change such commitment, and is not binding\n            yet in either state. The sustainability of project results\n            remains highly questionable, not only because appropriate\n            arrangements were absent, but even more importantly because\n            the thrust of the projects was, and likely still is, not in\n            line with the local mainstream. The project reformulation\n            after the mid-term review did not address the principal\n            shortcomings of the original projects. They accommodated one\n            part of society (\"organized civil society\"), but\n            not private sector interests, on the basis of a vague\n            strategy of community-driven development, largely without\n            any solid and proven natural resource management\n            technologies that would have reverted the mainstream use\n            (clearing) of rain forests.

In the case of this\n            Request, communities previously adversely affected in\n            Rondonia by the POLONOROESTE program expected beneficial\n            effects from the implementation of PLANAFLORO according to\n            the standards and timetable promised by the Bank, but\n            expectations were not met. The intended beneficiaries\n            represented by local non governmental organizations (NGOs)\n            requested the Panel to investigate the reasons for the\n            Bank's failure to carry out its commitment to prevent\n            further damage to their land. The Requesters'\n            fundamental complaint is that the Project-intended to be\n            beneficial to fragile communities and the natural\n            environments they depend on for their livelihood-has not\n            been adequately implemented since Board approval 3 1/2 years\n            ago. The Panel is presenting this additional review based on\n            available data at this time because: Sufficient information\n            is available to illustrate how the rights and interests of\n            groups have been adversely affected and that they have\n            suffered substantial, possibly irreversible, material\n            damage.  Damage continues and in some areas is worsening,\n            but it could be mitigated in the future if Management takes\n            steps to remedy the situation in high priority vulnerable\n            areas--quickly. If authorized, an investigation to obtain\n            specific data indicating and evidence quantifying monetary\n            and other damage that occurred between 1992 and 1995 in all\n            other relevant areas of the State of Rondonia, would take\n            about six months. A \"Work Plan\" is attached as\n            ANNEX A. It is imperative to set project priorities now to\n            accelerate implementation of feasible remedial measures for\n            this beneficial on-going project. This may involve\n            reorientation of goals and a revision of specific targets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rondonia Natural Resources\n            Management Project : Report on Additional Review"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Rondonia Natural\n            Resources Management Project : Report on Additional Review"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/12/3752100/brazil-rondonia-natural-resources-management-project-report-additional-review","projn":"BR-Rondonia Natural Resources Management\n            Project -- P006454","docty":"Investigation Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Forestry,Agricultural Research,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Environment,Energy,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000265513_20040527172220"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Sub-national government administration,Micro- and SME finance,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Energy,Agriculture,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Conservation,Deforestation,deforestation\n            rates,Expenditures,FAO,fires,Forest,forest loss,Forest\n            Reserves,Forest Resources,forests,illegal\n            deforestation,Illegal logging,income,land holdings,Land\n            Tenure,land tenure problems,local\n            authorities,logging,national income,natural capital,natural\n            resource,natural resource base,Natural Resources,Natural\n            Resources Management,Resources Management,soils,State Forest,timber,trees,violence,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"Conservation,Deforestation,deforestation\n            rates,Expenditures,FAO,fires,Forest,forest loss,Forest\n            Reserves,Forest Resources,forests,illegal\n            deforestation,Illegal logging,income,land holdings,Land\n            Tenure,land tenure problems,local\n            authorities,logging,national income,natural capital,natural\n            resource,natural resource base,Natural Resources,Natural\n            Resources Management,Resources Management,soils,State Forest,timber,trees,violence,wood"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF034231-BRAZIL - RONDONIA MATO GROSSO PROJECT,TF035859-BRAZIL - RONDONIA AND MATO\n            GROSSO NATURAL RESOURCES MGMT PROJ.,TF040026-BRAZIL-RO AND MT NATURAL\n            RESOURCES MNG.
