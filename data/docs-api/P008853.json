World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were highly satisfactory overall.\n            Theses were the lessons learned: to promote environmental\n            investments which otherwise may not at all, or only very\n            slowly, come about, the low cost-directed credit of the\n            Ekofund for the funding of air pollution abatement projects\n            was welcome, timely, and successful. And the successful\n            implementation of the air pollution abatement program (APAP)\n            component helped alert commercial banks to compete for this\n            market so that in the near future the program would no\n            longer be needed. It is important to carefully design such a\n            program, to keep procedures simple, to conduct regular\n            public relations campaigns, and to address potential\n            customers even directly. Also, the administration of the\n            program has to be carefully planned and implemented. This\n            could be achieved by launching a pilot phase on a limited\n            scope and choosing professional implementers. A lot of early\n            campaigning had to be done to provide knowledge about the\n            Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and to report the\n            multifold benefits which could be derived from relatively\n            small investments. This understanding is important since\n            constant and sustained cooperation with potential clients\n            and users for new systems, as well as sustained training of\n            future users, are essential ingredients for a successful project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovenia -

The project consists of two\n            major components: 1) an air pollution abatement component\n            which will provide fuel conversion loans to about 6,500\n            households and about 65 boilerhouse operators during the\n            three years over which the Bank loan will be disbursed.\n            These loans will be used to finance the conversion of\n            heating and hot water systems currently using polluting\n            fuels to the use of cleaner fuels; and 2) a geographical\n            information system (GIS) component which will include the\n            following: (a) the establishment of a central Geographical\n            Information Center; (b) the establishment of a market\n            development group to promote the use of GIS, to provide\n            training (in the use of GIS), to raise market awareness on\n            exchange of data and to provide assistance to regional\n            administrations, government agencies and departments, and\n            domestic and foreign industrial, commercial and service\n            users; (c) the establishment of formal standards (in line\n            with international standards) on data collection, use and\n            maintenance of data and quality assurance compliance group\n            to ensure that the information system operates in accordance\n            with international standards; and (d) the establishment of a\n            local training center in order to develop local expertise in\n            the operation of GIS."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovenia -
