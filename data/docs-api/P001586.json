Both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are assessed\n            unsatisfactory, given the poor quality at entry, conducive\n            to critical failures in the appraisal of management\n            practices, and, the neglect in establishing an independent\n            research advisory committee to oversee the project's\n            science agenda, respectively. The lessons learned raise two\n            major issues: a) how to ensure a balanced scientific\n            research, and pro-active planning for resource management,\n            and, b) how to achieve sustainable management of\n            trans-boundary resources, given differing riparian\n            interests, and incentives to participate. The balance\n            between research, and planning appears to be primarily\n            determined by the terms of reference of the project manager,\n            and to a lesser extent, by the effectiveness of the steering\n            committee. While undoubtedly, the project's\n            science-bias caused a lack of focus on the planning, and\n            resource management, a more generalist scientific approach\n            would have improved the Lake's management plans, and, a\n            well designed operational set-up would have achieved\n            relevant objectives, with a greater inclusive, and riparian\n            approach to a balanced biodiversity conservation. Bank\n            efforts should facilitate regional institutions, and plan\n            extensive consultations to coordinate riparian efforts,\n            through free-standing projects to better support\n            cross-boundary resource conservation, with objective\n            management, and technical reviews, and carefully structured partnerships."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - GEF/SADC Lake Malawi / Nyasa\n            Biodiversity Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - GEF/SADC Lake Malawi /\n            Nyasa Biodiversity Conservation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/08/1561450/malawi-gefsadc-lake-malawi-nyasa-biodiversity-conservation-project","projn":"MW-Lake Malawi -- P001586","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Wetlands,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Malawi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01090504005582"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"algae,assistance in\n            kind,Biodiversity,biodiversity research,biological\n            diversity,breeding,Canadian International Development\n            Agency,capacity building,CIDA,community\n            participation,comparative advantage,deep\n            water,deforestation,diet,ecology,economic\n            growth,environmental impacts,environmental\n            management,equipment,erosion,extension,FAO,field\n            research,Financial Resources,fish,fish\n            production,fisheries,fisheries\n            management,fishing,Forestry,fresh water,Freshwater,funds for\n            research,GIS,habitats,housing,human activities,human\n            activity,Inland Fisheries,international\n            organizations,laboratories,lakes,land management,land\n            use,legislation,limnology,managers,marketing,natural\n            resource management,natural resources,natural resources\n            management,Parks,partnership,policy\n            makers,pollution,Posters,productivity,rainfall,research\n            agenda,resource conservation,resource\n            use,savings,schools,scientific knowledge,scientific\n            research,scientists,sediment,sustainable\n            management,UNDP,watershed,watershed management,watersheds,Wildlife"},"1":{"cdata!":"algae,assistance in\n            kind,Biodiversity,biodiversity research,biological\n            diversity,breeding,Canadian International Development\n            Agency,capacity building,CIDA,community\n            participation,comparative advantage,deep\n            water,deforestation,diet,ecology,economic\n            growth,environmental impacts,environmental\n            management,equipment,erosion,extension,FAO,field\n            research,Financial Resources,fish,fish\n            production,fisheries,fisheries\n            management,fishing,Forestry,fresh water,Freshwater,funds for\n            research,GIS,habitats,housing,human activities,human\n            activity,Inland Fisheries,international\n            organizations,laboratories,lakes,land management,land\n            use,legislation,limnology,managers,marketing,natural\n            resource management,natural resources,natural resources\n            management,Parks,partnership,policy\n            makers,pollution,Posters,productivity,rainfall,research\n            agenda,resource conservation,resource\n            use,savings,schools,scientific knowledge,scientific\n            research,scientists,sediment,sustainable\n            management,UNDP,watershed,watershed management,watersheds,Wildlife"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028098-UK (ODA) CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF026530-TAGPE - ENVIR.

The absence\n            of data on the Lake's biodiversity, and productive\n            systems, justified research which, in parallel with\n            on-the-job training towards building the riparian states\n            institutional capacity, was conducted by highly academic,\n            and scientific experts. This far sighted decision, provided\n            a cadre of scientific personnel, who can now build upon the\n            research undertaken, to manage the lake in the future.\n            However, it is important to note that the project's\n            institutional design stems from weak horizontal linkages\n            with national institutions, a most relevant factor to\n            scientific findings. These institutions, the Fisheries\n            Department, Water Resources Department, and the University\n            of Malawi, whose linkages most likely may not reduce the\n            long-term impact of the project, may well delay the adequacy\n            of the lake's management. Nonetheless, the\n            establishment of an environmental monitoring program for the\n            maintenance of ecosystems, was a major decision for riparian\n            cooperation in the lake's resource management, for it\n            lay the foundation to strengthen riparian capacity, in\n            preparation of the next phase of the program. However, the\n            project reinforces that insufficient preparation of project\n            components affects, and delays implementation, for it forces\n            management to determine factors whose suitability should\n            have been set at appraisal.

measuring water quality at sites where human\n            activities threaten biodiversity; (d) preparing a Strategic\n            Plan for the Nankumba Peninsula and Lake Malawi National\n            Park for eco-tourism development, consistent with the\n            protection and conservation of the Lake's biodiversity;\n            (e) preparing a comprehensive Biodiversity Map and\n            Management Plan for Lake Malawi/Nyasa based on the\n            information provided by the species, habitat, and water\n            quality analyses; (f) increasing conservation awareness\n            among the lakeshore population and regional and national\n            policy makers, whose decisions regarding regional\n            development have an impact on the Lake's ecosystem; and\n            (g) reviewing the adequacy of existing national\n            environmental legislation in Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania\n            and making appropriate legislative recommendations for\n            revision and/or strengthening enforcement for the\n            conservation of the Lake's biodiversity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Lake Malawi / Nyasa Biodiversity\n            Conservation
