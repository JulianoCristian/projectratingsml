The Bank performed successfully in all stages\n            of the project, and in particular, was instrumental in\n            providing recommendations to the Shandong Provincial\n            Electric Power Bureau (SPEPB), in the revision of project\n            costs, cautioning about implementation delays of project\n            components, in early stages, and, ensuring a timely\n            completion. This in turn, translated into a close\n            cooperation with the borrower, whose understanding of\n            management performance was conducive to a successful\n            international standardization process. The tariff reform\n            action plan, has now the full commitment from SPEPB, to\n            continue the tariff reforms within the agreed framework.\n            Time an again, the lessons show, that implementing agencies,\n            with strong ownership and commitment are key to success.\n            However, and regardless of success, it is suggested that\n            procurement should be determined early on, to minimize\n            interface work during implementation. Furthermore, although\n            experienced foreign consultants were selected, certain\n            issues, such as engineering, construction, and,\n            commissioning, did not meet the implementing agencies'\n            expectations, although did not affect the project adversely.\n            To ensure timely policy reforms, further guidance could be\n            provided by the
