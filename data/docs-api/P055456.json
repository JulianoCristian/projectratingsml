Lessons learned from the projects\n            included: 1) when the experience of the implementing agency\n            in managing projects is limited, and especially when such\n            projects are complex, it is essential to appoint a project\n            management consultant early-on to compensate for any gaps in\n            expertise. Most of the difficulties experienced in the\n            implementation of the Telecom Sector Reform Project,\n            involving the modernization of the country's radio\n            frequency and licensing system, were attributable to\n            inability to take decisions and lack of capacity to find\n            solutions to problems; and 2) in a sector where technology\n            advancement is a key driver of change, it is necessary to\n            build sufficient flexibility and foresight into the\n            projects. In the India Telecom Reform Project, flexibility\n            allowed for project realignment during implementation, when\n            required, thus facilitating a redefinition of needs. An\n            example of this was an unexpected need to gain an\n            understanding of television broadcasting signal technology.\n            However, with regard to the need for foresight, a better\n            understanding of the relationship between rapid\n            technological change and project costs could have avoided a\n            serious overestimate of equipment costs, and this would have\n            saved US$ 331,000 in front-end fees, while the Bank would\n            have better utilized part of its loan. Obsolescence also\n            occurs more quickly in the telecommunications field and so\n            it is critical to avoid delays in project completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Telecommunications Sector Reform\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -

Lessons learned from the project: Clear\n            leadership, willingness to implement reforms at a senior\n            level, and a broad consensus of priorities are prerequisites\n            for smooth project implementation. Investing in capacity\n            building is key to addressing sustainability: once expertise\n            is developed, institutions become empowered to drive and\n            sustain reforms. Project Implementation Units (PIUs) need to\n            be empowered with the appropriate staff, resources, and\n            authority over the elements that directly affect\n            implementation. The provision of adequate technical\n            assistance at the very beginning to build good project\n            management and implementation capacity in the PIU, could\n            have contributed greatly to the success and sustainability\n            of the project. When projects are complex and the experience\n            in managing such projects is limited, it is essential to\n            appoint a project management consultant early on, and to\n            ensure that there is the appropriate buy-in for their\n            recommendations. In complex systems, when using two\n            subcontractors, it is essential to establish a clear\n            reporting structure, and preferably for one contractor to be\n            subordinate to the other, so that ultimate responsibility\n            lies with a single contractor. In the telecommunications\n            sector where technology advancement is a key driver of\n            change, it is necessary to build flexibility into the\n            project. For a more sophisticated or institutionally capable\n            client such as Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the\n            Consultants Qualification procurement method was useful and\n            provided significant flexibility and speed in hiring\n            consultants to help with important or urgent issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
