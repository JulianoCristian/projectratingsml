The lessons learned indicate that combining\n            long-term disaster mitigation activities management into a\n            three year emergency reconstruction project proved to be\n            unrealistic and contributed to the failure in completing\n            some of the disaster mitigation activities within the\n            expected timeframe. Early resolution is required on the\n            institutional arrangements for a core institution with\n            adequate capacity and power to take the lead in hazard\n            mitigation activities. Adequacy of project preparation is\n            crucial, and this should continue to be followed up\n            rigorously during implementation period in the case of\n            emergency operation. The Government of Andhra Pradesh\n            (GoAP's) maintenance of cap on bid prices is\n            inconsistent with Bank procurement rules, as it may result\n            in rebidding, lack of credible response to bid invitations,\n            bid rejections and delayed action, which in the end would\n            hamper the quality of work. Efficient project management and\n            delegation of full administrative and financial powers to\n            implementing agency proved to be beneficial. Information\n            dissemination, capacity building of the implementing\n            agencies' staff and proper due diligence are crucial,\n            particularly in complex, multi-sectoral projects.\n            Establishment of a specialized maintenance wing within AP\n            Transco and initiation of community involvement in\n            maintenance proved to have considerably contributed to more\n            trouble-free operation and strengthened maintenance.\n            Extension to project implementation period provides the\n            window of opportunity for remedial actions and should be\n            followed up more rigorously during the extension period.\n            Land acquisition and resettlement impacts need to be fully\n            considered for implementation of infrastructure works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Andhra Pradesh Hazard Mitigation and\n            Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Andhra Pradesh Hazard\n            Mitigation and Emergency Cyclone Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/11/2877083/india-andhra-pradesh-hazard-mitigation-emergency-cyclone-recovery-project","projn":"IN-A.P.
