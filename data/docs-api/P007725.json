The sharp devaluation\n            of Mexican peso in 1994-95 led to a reduction in project\n            costs, which in turn led to a partial cancellation of the\n            Bank loan in 1995 and a complex project restructuring\n            exercise which was successfully completed in 1997. As a\n            result, project objectives were expanded and two new\n            components were added. The key lessons learned include: A\n            clear and consistent policy framework is key to the\n            achievement of project objectives. Project ownership and\n            continuous participation of stakeholders greatly enhance\n            project design and implementation. Effective targeting is\n            essential to optimize the impact of compensatory programs.\n            Precise output indicators should not obviate the need for\n            outcome indicators. The results of the measurement of\n            education quality must be analyzed and disseminated.\n            Updating teaching skills through in-service training can be\n            more effective when combined with classroom-based technical\n            assistance. Community participation greatly improves the\n            cost-effectiveness of school infrastructure investments but\n            requires appropriate design and technical supervision.\n            Community agreements for the maintenance of school buildings\n            need to be properly funded."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Second Primary Education
