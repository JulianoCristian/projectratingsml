Competitiveness and Enterprise\n            Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Competitiveness and\n            Enterprise Development Project for Rwanda were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the successful\n            implementation of policy and institutional reforms requires\n            adequate capacity in key areas. This factor will need\n            special attention in the formulation of future programs.\n            Human capital constraints were a major factor in slowing\n            down the implementation of some of the program's\n            components and the management of the project. The Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) also needs to be properly staffed\n            with a trained fiduciary team. One recommendation is to\n            identify members of the PCU and initiate training on World\n            Bank guidelines at the design stage such that the PCU team\n            is fully capable of kick starting the implementation phase\n            as soon as the project is approved. In countries with\n            limited institutional capacity, having the Task Team Leader\n            (TTL) in the field can help to resolve issues as they raise\n            with either the PCU, Implementing agencies or Government and\n            ensure a constant implementation pace. The project brought\n            together experts across various sectors and units within the\n            World Bank Group and from other donor agencies. It was\n            challenging to coordinate technical and supervision missions\n            from the different stakeholders. One recommendation would be\n            to coordinate missions so as to have a common dialogue on\n            issues to be addressed, action plans to be implemented and\n            agreed roles and responsibilities of each team. The Business\n            Plan Competition enabled potential entrepreneurs throughout\n            Rwanda to be aware of the support services provided to Small\n            and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to start their project.\n            Through this competition, participating SMEs were given\n            mentoring and hand holding services to conceptualize their\n            business ideas and prepare bankable projects. Rwanda was\n            positioned as a pocket of excellence in doing business\n            reforms and facilitated the replication of the successful\n            reform experiences across the region
