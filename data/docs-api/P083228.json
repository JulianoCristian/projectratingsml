Some lessons\n            learned included: Strong political support and government\n            ownership is essential for any program to succeed. This\n            leads to high level of monitoring and oversight. Continuity\n            of the same team over a project, including officials and\n            politicians at various tiers helps maintain momentum of\n            reforms and enhances the probability of success of a\n            program. Success of a program requires a flexible approach\n            to implementation with effective monitoring and evaluation\n            of the program during the implementation process with the\n            help of relevant data and information to identify\n            shortcomings and problem issues and be able to rectify them\n            during the course of implementation. Strong ongoing\n            analytical work helps deepen and refine policies and\n            programs. Finally, the success of any education system is\n            judged by the quality of its graduates. While quality\n            remains the core desired outcome of any education reform\n            program, it takes several years to show tangible results.\n            Therefore, education reforms require a long term commitment,\n            backed by a clear strategy for improving school level\n            performance through both quantitative and qualitative

The performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are satisfactory. Several factors\n            have affected the satisfactory implementation and outcomes\n            in the Program supported by PEDPC II. First, the continued\n            high level political support and commitment has kept the\n            Program on track, enabling the Government to take on\n            challenging institutional reforms, such as establishing an\n            independent Examination Commission, moving forward on the\n            restructuring of the Textbook Board, and the Chief\n            Minister's monitoring teams that have helped to fill\n            gaps in district monitoring. Second, alignment in the senior\n            provincial management and bureaucracy has been maintained\n            which also facilitates implementation. Third, the Government\n            has maintained its financing commitments under the medium\n            Term Budget Framework. Fourth and most important, a strong\n            management information system and data analysis has helped\n            to monitor progress and to identify areas that require\n            further support. There are however factors that have\n            hindered progress in implementation and outcomes in certain\n            areas. Delays in reorganization of the district education\n            system have delayed the start up of district capacity\n            building programs. This has in turn affected the capacity to\n            monitor school performance, including setting up a\n            streamlined system to monitor teacher absenteeism. The slow\n            progress in capacity building of school councils has also\n            delayed activating school councils to play a more effective\n            role. The institutional reforms required for improving\n            quality have taken longer than earlier anticipated, but will\n            be a key focus in the next phase of reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Development Policy Credit\n            (PEDPCII) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Development\n            Policy Credit (PEDPCII) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/05/6959041/pakistan-second-development-policy-credit-pedpcii-project","projn":"PK-Punjab Education Sector Adjustment Credit\n            -- P083228","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Primary Education,Education For All,Tertiary Education","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Education","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060731114740"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General education sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absence of teachers, Access to Education,\n            Achievements, assessment of achievement, budget for\n            education, career, chronic absenteeism, civil society,\n            classroom, classroom practice, classroom space, cohort\n            analysis, college education, completion rates,\n            Decentralization, district education, drop out rates,\n            Education Assessment, education budget, education\n            department, education departments, Education Development,\n            education indicators, Education Management, education\n            outcomes, education policies, education reforms, Education\n            Sector, Education Sector Development, education system,\n            educational institutes, elementary education, Enrollment\n            increases, Enrollment Rate, enrollment rates, enrolment\n            increases, Equitable Access, expenditures, female teachers,\n            free textbooks, gender gap, gender parity, girl students,\n            girls, graduate degrees, Human Development, information\n            systems, interventions, leadership, learning, learning\n            environment, literacy, literacy levels, mathematics,\n            Ministry of Education, mobility, National Education, NER,\n            net enrollment, number of students, number of textbooks,\n            Primary Completion, Primary Completion rate, Primary\n            Enrollment Rates, primary school, Primary school completion,\n            Primary school completion rates, primary school teachers,\n            primary schools, Primary \u00ad Grade, private partnerships,\n            private schools, private sector providers, professional\n            development, provincial education, public expenditure,\n            public school, public training, qualified teachers, Quality\n            Education, quality of education, quality of teachers,\n            quality of teaching, Recruitment of teachers, regular\n            teachers, repeaters, rural areas, school affairs, school\n            census, school construction, School Councils, school\n            education, school enrollment, school enrolments, school\n            level, school performance, school students, school year,\n            schooling, Schools, skill development, Staff Development,\n            stipends, student learning, student learning outcomes,\n            targeted incentives, teacher, teacher absenteeism, teacher\n            development, teacher development programs, teacher\n            management, Teacher performance, teacher professional\n            development, teacher recruitment, teacher requirements,\n            teacher training, teachers, Teaching, technical assistance,\n            technical expertise, textbook, Textbook Board, textbook\n            distribution, textbook printing, training institutes,\n            tuition, Universal Primary Education, Universal Primary\n            Enrollment, UPE, urban slums"}},"owner":"S.A.

Education Sector Adjustment\n            Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The purpose of this Education Sector\n            Adjustment Credit for Pakistan is to provide financing for\n            the Province of Punjab, which has embarked on a wide-ranging\n            reform agenda to improve fiscal management, promote\n            devolution and improve service delivery starting with\n            education. The credit is the first of a series of three\n            adjustment credits to support the Government of\n            Punjab's medium-term sector-wide reform program to\n            enhance access and quality of education. Punjab is\n            reallocating public expenditures towards education and other\n            pro-poor programs, and implementing national initiatives on\n            decentralization and the accompanying public finance and\n            management reforms, using the education sector as the\n            leading sector. The Government has developed a Punjab\n            Education Sector Reform Program (PESRP) Strategy that is\n            consistent with the National Education Sector Reform\n            Program. The Punjab ESRP has three pillars: (A) public\n            finance reforms to realign expenditures at the provincial\n            and district level toward education and other pro-poor\n            expenditures; (B) devolution and public sector management\n            reforms; and (C) education sector reforms to improve\n            quality, access, and governance of the education system.\n            These reforms will be fully implemented over a three-year\n            period. The first two pillars of the reforms are also\n            supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the\n            Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP). The Punjab\n            Government has also developed a Provincial PRSP, which,\n            among other things, supports the devolution of decision\n            making and finances to districts and provides the impetus\n            for public finance and management reforms. These reforms are\n            being undertaken concurrently. As earlier experience in\n            Pakistan shows, education sector reforms cannot be\n            successful without reforms in public finance management and\n            governance. While significant actions were taken prior to\n            the first IDA Credit, this reform program envisages\n            completion of future actions by FY06. The main benefits come\n            from reversing the slide in education indicators, bringing\n            more children (particularly poor children and girls) into\n            school, up to grade 8 sooner than previously expected, and\n            providing them with better quality education.
