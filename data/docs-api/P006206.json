OED rates the outcome of both the FIS II\n            water supply and sanitation components and the RWSP projects\n            as \"satisfactory\" since the FIS II project\n            combined \"substantial\" relevance, efficiacy, and\n            efficiency and the RWSP project \"high\" relevance\n            with \"substantial\" efficacy and efficiency.\n            Sustainability of both projects are rated\n            \"likely.\" World Bank performance of both projects\n            is rated \"satisfactory\" although it should be\n            noted that quality at entry of the RWSP was superior to that\n            of the FIS II. Similarly, Borrower performance for both was\n            rated as \"satisfactory.\" Two main lessons were\n            derived and recommendation made: The end of construction\n            does not end the government's responsibilities;\n            therefore, the government must create back-up regulation and\n            operational assistance to the communities. Second, rural\n            water supply and sanitation programs invariably neglect the\n            sanitation components; therefore, it is advised that a\n            national sewerage and sanitation program be prepared and implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -

Some of the many lessons learned from\n            this project include the following: Community participation\n            is key for sustainability. Training should include both men\n            and women. Communities and municipalities have demonstrated\n            the capacity to finance a high percentage of investment\n            costs. A \"price and subsidy cap\" is an important\n            tool to force a review and reduction of costs and stretch\n            the public money to reach more people. The tendency for\n            costs to increase with each added actor is noted (consulant\n            to prefecture, to Social Investment Fund (SIF) to\n            contractor, and back to SIF). Incentives mattered in\n            enticing the SIF to consider low-cost options and reduce the\n            final costs of the sub-projects. One agency should be\n            responsible for all aspects of project implementation.\n            Reduce the number of contracts and increase the size of the\n            packages as far as possible. Propose early involvement of\n            the municipalities which have shown increasing interest and\n            capacity. Counterpart funding should be assured from the\n            outset. Simplify the process of design and system of\n            approval. Community development and training should continue\n            after construction. Increase the use of auto-construction\n            method with the help of NGOs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Rural Water and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Rural Water and\n            Sanitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/03/1738584/bolivia-rural-water-sanitation-project","projn":"BO-Rural Water And Sanitation -- P006206","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Services to the Poor,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02032804021558"},"subsc":"Water supply,Central government administration,Other social services,Sub-national government administration,Sanitation","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Bacteriological quality,Basic\n            Services,beneficiary communities,capacity\n            building,certification,Child mortality,Child mortality\n            rate,clean water,community contribution,community\n            members,community needs,community organizations,community\n            participation,community water,Cost recovery,counterpart\n            funding,decision making,demand for water,disposal\n            systems,hand pumps,health conditions,household\n            connections,households,Housing,hygiene education,investment\n            costs,latrine construction,local communities,local\n            community,local governments,local water,maintenance\n            costs,maintenance of water,management of water,municipal\n            governments,municipal level,Municipalities,number of\n            beneficiaries,operation of water supply,Pipe system,Project\n            Management,provision of water,Public\n            Participation,pumping,quality of water,rural\n            communities,rural dwellers,rural population,Rural\n            Water,Rural Water Supply,sanitary\n            facilities,Sanitation,sanitation coverage,sanitation\n            infrastructure,sanitation sector,sanitation\n            services,sanitation systems,schools,sewage\n            collection,sewerage systems,Small Towns,Small Towns Water\n            Supply,spring protection,sustainable use,sustainable\n            water,Urban Development,use of water,wastewater,wastewater\n            collection,wastewater treatment,Water coverage,water\n            investments,Water Management,water projects,water\n            quality,water sector,water service,water supply\n            systems,water use,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"Bacteriological quality,Basic\n            Services,beneficiary communities,capacity\n            building,certification,Child mortality,Child mortality\n            rate,clean water,community contribution,community\n            members,community needs,community organizations,community\n            participation,community water,Cost recovery,counterpart\n            funding,decision making,demand for water,disposal\n            systems,hand pumps,health conditions,household\n            connections,households,Housing,hygiene education,investment\n            costs,latrine construction,local communities,local\n            community,local governments,local water,maintenance\n            costs,maintenance of water,management of water,municipal\n            governments,municipal level,Municipalities,number of\n            beneficiaries,operation of water supply,Pipe system,Project\n            Management,provision of water,Public\n            Participation,pumping,quality of water,rural\n            communities,rural dwellers,rural population,Rural\n            Water,Rural Water Supply,sanitary\n            facilities,Sanitation,sanitation coverage,sanitation\n            infrastructure,sanitation sector,sanitation\n            services,sanitation systems,schools,sewage\n            collection,sewerage systems,Small Towns,Small Towns Water\n            Supply,spring protection,sustainable use,sustainable\n            water,Urban Development,use of water,wastewater,wastewater\n            collection,wastewater treatment,Water coverage,water\n            investments,Water Management,water projects,water\n            quality,water sector,water service,water supply\n            systems,water use,wells"}},"owner":"Water & Sanitation Cluster (LCSFW)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF034638-BOLIVIA -
