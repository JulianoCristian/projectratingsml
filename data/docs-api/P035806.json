Some lessons\n            learned included: (1) given the large attitudinal shift\n            involved in the agricultural transition, government\n            officials and project staff need substantial technical\n            assistance and training before operations can be expected to\n            succeed; (2) in the complex and rapidly changing ECA\n            environment, sound donor coordination was critical; (3) with\n            respect to agriculture and agribusiness services, project\n            experience demonstrated that farmers and rural business\n            owners will respond enthusiastically to innovative\n            technologies corresponding to their needs; (4) on land\n            administration, the Bank\u0092s international experience\n            strengthened the design of projects in ECA, and these\n            projects showed the importance of avoiding a\n            'one-size-fits- all' approach and the sound payoff\n            to adopting a unified approach to develop property registry\n            and cadaster; and (5) the rural finance operations showed\n            that with appropriate regulation, technical advice and staff\n            training banks that lend to rural areas can operate\n            sustainably; also, non-bank financial intermediaries have an\n            important role to play in rural areas; but it is important\n            to be realistic about their capabilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Europe and Central Asia - Agricultural\n            Reform Support and Agricultural Development

The\n            intermediate objectives of the project are to develop an\n            agricultural credit system and target the needs of small\n            farmers in agricultural research, extension and provision of\n            market information.  The project has three components:  a)\n            provide loans for working capital and investments to small\n            farms and business;  b) provide agribusiness training and\n            technical assistance in project finance to private\n            agricultural processing and marketing enterprises to assist\n            them in post-privatization restructuring;  and c) initiate\n
