supervise efficient export and import\n            substitution projects. Medium and long term credit, which is\n            in short supply, would be made available to financial\n            intermediaries through FODEIN to finance fixed assets,\n            permanent working capital and preinvestment studies.\n            Financial intermediaries would receive incentives to lend to\n            smaller enterprises for which FODEIN would also furnish a\n            guarantee facility. The project faces no special risks,\n            although close initial supervision may be required since the\n            intitutional arrangements for project administration are new."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Industrial Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Industrial Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/05/726840/costa-rica-industrial-credit-project","projn":"CR-Industrial Credit (D -- P006916","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Costa Rica","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912394041"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agricultural Credit,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,assets,audits,balance of\n            payments,Balance Sheet,bank loans,banking law,banking\n            system,capital goods,capital loans,capital\n            requirements,Central Bank,collateral,commercial\n            banks,comparative advantage,comparative advantages,corporate\n            profits,credit policies,current\n            prices,debt,decentralization,depreciation,distribution of\n            income,Economic Integration,economic policies,Economic Rate\n            of Return,Employment,equity investments,evaluation\n            criteria,Exports,Financial Institutions,Financial\n            Intermediaries,financial leverage,financial sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Foreign banks,foreign exchange,GDP,GNP,growth\n            rate,imports,inflation,inflation rate,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,Intermediate goods,labor costs,labor\n            force,legislation,Lending rates,liquidity,monetary\n            authorities,monetary policy,natural resources,now\n            accounts,policy instruments,policy makers,production\n            costs,Reserve requirements,resource\n            allocation,Savings,Savings accounts,state\n            banks,subsidiaries,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,time\n            deposits,value added,wages,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agricultural Credit,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,assets,audits,balance of\n            payments,Balance Sheet,bank loans,banking law,banking\n            system,capital goods,capital loans,capital\n            requirements,Central Bank,collateral,commercial\n            banks,comparative advantage,comparative advantages,corporate\n            profits,credit policies,current\n            prices,debt,decentralization,depreciation,distribution of\n            income,Economic Integration,economic policies,Economic Rate\n            of Return,Employment,equity investments,evaluation\n            criteria,Exports,Financial Institutions,Financial\n            Intermediaries,financial leverage,financial sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Foreign banks,foreign exchange,GDP,GNP,growth\n            rate,imports,inflation,inflation rate,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,Intermediate goods,labor costs,labor\n            force,legislation,Lending rates,liquidity,monetary\n            authorities,monetary policy,natural resources,now\n            accounts,policy instruments,policy makers,production\n            costs,Reserve requirements,resource\n            allocation,Savings,Savings accounts,state\n            banks,subsidiaries,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,time\n            deposits,value added,wages,working capital"}},"owner":"Central America Countries CMU (LCC2C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"repnb":"2029"},"facets":{}}}
