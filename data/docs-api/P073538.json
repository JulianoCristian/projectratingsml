In response, the\n            Bank in December 2000 launched an emergency response program\n            (ERP) with a 12 million dollars grant to ease the harshest\n            effects of the closure by offering temporary jobs to\n            Palestinian workers. Designed by the Bank in cooperation\n            with village councils, municipalities, and Palestinian\n            authorities' agencies, the program has so far created\n            more than 190,000 direct person days of work for\n            Palestinians in West Bank and Gaza through 232 micro projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - World Bank responds to emergency"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - World Bank\n            responds to emergency"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23835843/west-bank-gaza-world-bank-responds-emergency","count":"West Bank and Gaza","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,adverse\n            effects,auditors,economic activity,economic\n            impact,Education,employment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,families,FISCAL YEAR,GNP,Gross National\n            Product,Health,income,interest income,labor\n            force,liquidity,Local Government,municipalities,national\n            income,non-governmental organizations,poverty line,private\n            consumption,Productivity,savings,solid waste collection,tax\n            collection,trade flows,transaction\n            costs,unemployment,wages,waste,workersEmergency recovery\n            loan;

Project\n            sustainability is rated as likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included the following: Using existing and\n            well-functioning programs to channel funds for emergency\n            operations can be effective. The use of existing mechanisms\n            for disbursement and financial control can give a project\n            immediate impetus and reduce the time needed for\n            preparation. Decentralized assistance to the client by the\n            Bank can be a determining factor in project success. It is\n            especially useful for task teams to be close to the client\n            in emergency projects with short implementation periods.\n            Statistics on employment generation can be misleading and\n            need to be carefully interpreted. Quick implementation of\n            emergency community projects requires decentralized,\n            streamlined implementation procedures. Simplified\n            procurement methods and disbursement procedures can be a\n            major factor in speeding up project implementation. Strong\n            project ownership is a determining factor for success. In\n            emergency operations, detailed analysis of the longer terms\n            issues related to sustainability and risk should be done at\n            project preparation. A review should be taken with other\n            donors to assess how these types of projects can be scaled\n            up and how they can have a greater impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Emergency Response\n            Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - Emergency\n            Response Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/02/1732199/west-bank-gaza-emergency-response-program-project","projn":"GZ-Emergency Response Program -- P073538","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Municipal Financial Management,Urban Services to the Poor,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"West Bank and Gaza","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02032204102280"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Roads and highways,Other social services,Health,General education sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Bank Performance,Basic\n            Services,cities,clinics,communities,Community\n            Development,emergency projects,employment,families,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,girls,incremental costs,Institutional\n            Development,interest income,intervention,Islamic Development\n            Bank,labor unions,local councils,Local Government,local\n            governments,municipalities,partnership,playgrounds,Private\n            Sector,road\n            construction,roads,safety,sanitation,schools,sewage,technical\n            assistance,unemployment,urban planning,water supply,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Bank Performance,Basic\n            Services,cities,clinics,communities,Community\n            Development,emergency projects,employment,families,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,girls,incremental costs,Institutional\n            Development,interest income,intervention,Islamic Development\n            Bank,labor unions,local councils,Local Government,local\n            governments,municipalities,partnership,playgrounds,Private\n            Sector,road\n            construction,roads,safety,sanitation,schools,sewage,technical\n            assistance,unemployment,urban planning,water supply,workers"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"23412"},"facets":{}}}
