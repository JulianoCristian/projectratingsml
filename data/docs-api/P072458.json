Some lessons learned included:\n            the first and most important lesson learned is the need for\n            a realistic and less ambitious approach in circumstances\n            encountered in Algeria. Less optimistic development\n            objectives should have been targeted and focusing directly\n            on project activity outcomes. The second lesson is the\n            requirement to invest more in consensus-building among\n            stakeholders during such ambitious reform processes. A third\n            lesson relates to changing priorities, such as a sudden\n            oil-generated financial bonanza, and the ensuing massive\n            level of investments. This heavily taxes the country's\n            absorptive capacity, particularly at the administrative\n            level. Unless this overall capacity is drastically expanded,\n            and commensurate means and explicit instructions handed down\n            to steadily develop 'soft' reforms, investments\n            will take priority and reforms ultimately become secondary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Transport Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Transport Technical\n

The project components will provide: 1)\n            technical assistance (TA) for the ports reform, by\n            implementing an institutional framework for better public\n            planning, land management, and regulation, while opening the\n            delivery of services to private sector participation, under\n            competitive conditions.
