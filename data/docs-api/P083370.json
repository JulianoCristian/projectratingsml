Some lessons\n            learned included: the project successfully completed a\n            series of human capital development activities, but as\n            intended outcomes were conditional on external actions that\n            were not forthcoming, the project was unable to meet its\n            overall objective. A project design developed from a\n            rigorous identification of the necessary and sufficient\n            conditions for increasing civil service capacity, with\n            activities structured around each of these conditions, can\n            have potentially avoided these pitfalls. To ensure that\n            project development objectives (PDOs) are appropriately\n            focused on outcomes which can be reasonably expected to\n            result from outputs delivered by the project. When projects\n            outcomes are dependent on the continuing commitment of the\n            government to inherently unpopular reforms, designs need to\n            make a realistic accounting of these risks and propose\n            components that effectively mitigate the attendant risk and\n            or directly support the continuation of commitment. A more\n            developed delineation of the manner in which officers\n            trained by the project were to be expected to serve as\n            reform champions should have been used to develop policies\n            and services necessary to ensure the effective utilization\n            of project beneficiaries. To avoid a dilution of\n            implementation and supervision resources, as well as project\n            impacts, across an excessively large number of participating

Building Project in Pakistan is to improve the\n            Government's capacity to implement its on-going\n            economic reform program. Focusing on strategic areas, the\n            project will have three distinct capacity building\n            objectives: 1) broad-based professional development of\n            public sector officers; 2) capacity enhancement in key\n            ministries and agencies at the forefront of design,\n            implementation and monitoring of policy reforms; and 3)\n            strengthening of regulatory agencies. The Civil Service\n            restructuring is a significant administrative feature of the\n            Civil Service Reforms under the Economic Revival Program of\n            1999. The first component will address the capacity, and\n            technical skills gap in the civil service, largely focusing\n            on the professional development of federal and provincial\n            civil service, and ex-cadre officers. It will be undertaken\n            through a professional training program, on priority areas\n            for degree programs abroad, and, in-country training\n            capacity through support of training institutions. The civil\n            service recruitment process will be improved through support\n            to the Federal Public Service Commission. The second\n            component will strengthen economic policy and management,\n            through capacity building of key federal and provincial\n            ministries and divisions, including finance, planning,\n            commerce, central board of revenue, etc., who are in the\n            vanguard of design and implementation of the reform agenda.\n            Finally, the third component will support capacity building\n            of the newly established regulatory agencies through a\n            specialized training of officers, and, specialized technical\n            consultancies for analytical studies, and, includes\n            procurement of equipment and related materials. An\n            unallocated amount will be disbursed to interested\n            ministries/agencies, once their individual proposals are\n            approved by the National Steering and Coordination Committee (NSCC)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Public Sector Capacity Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Public Sector Capacity\n            Building

Capacity Building Project in Pakistan is to improve the\n            Government's capacity to implement its on-going\n            economic reform program. Focusing on strategic areas, the\n            project will have three distinct capacity building\n            objectives: 1) broad-based professional development of\n            public sector officers; 2) capacity enhancement in key\n            ministries and agencies at the forefront of design,\n            implementation and monitoring of policy reforms; and 3)\n            strengthening of regulatory agencies. The Civil Service\n            restructuring is a significant administrative feature of the\n            Civil Service Reforms under the Economic Revival Program of\n            1999. The first component will address the capacity, and\n            technical skills gap in the civil service, largely focusing\n            on the professional development of federal and provincial\n            civil service, and ex-cadre officers. It will be undertaken\n            through a professional training program, on priority areas\n            for degree programs abroad, and, in-country training\n            capacity through support of training institutions. The civil\n            service recruitment process will be improved through support\n            to the Federal Public Service Commission. The second\n            component will strengthen economic policy and management,\n            through capacity building of key federal and provincial\n            ministries and divisions, including finance, planning,\n            commerce, central board of revenue, etc., who are in the\n            vanguard of design and implementation of the reform agenda.\n            Finally, the third component will support capacity building\n            of the newly established regulatory agencies through a\n            specialized training of officers, and, specialized technical\n            consultancies for analytical studies, and, includes\n            procurement of equipment and related materials. An\n            unallocated amount will be disbursed to interested\n            ministries/agencies, once their individual proposals are\n            approved by the National Steering and Coordination Committee (NSCC)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Public Sector Capacity Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Public Sector Capacity\n            Building
