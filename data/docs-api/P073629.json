Some lessons\n            learned included: communities with limited technical\n            capacities and weak control mechanisms, financial\n            decentralization should follow a phased approach, which\n            fully capitalizes on past experience. The first phase of the\n            project successfully tested a mechanism for channeling\n            resources to communes and communities. This success gave\n            sufficient confidence to the Government, which enacted a\n            decision to transfer areas of competence and associated\n            resources for nine ministries to the communes, one of the\n            greatest achievements of the project was to create a new\n            environment for local development planning, financing and\n            management, leading to a greater command of the local\n            development process by communities, and to an improved\n            delivery of basic social services, simplicity in the process\n            of preparing local and communal development plans would\n            strengthen ownership and improve implementation efficiency.\n            A shortcoming of the project was the lack of a mechanism to\n            monitor communal development plans, as well as the absence\n            of expertise to provide operational content to the strategic\n            elements of the plans, a systematic use of simplified guides\n            and procedural manuals is critical for quality insurance and\n            greater fiduciary compliance at local level, sectoral\n            ministries have a critical role to play in ensuring quality\n            control of infrastructure realized through the local\n            development process; situations of conflict of interest are\n            to be avoided, financing communal agents is a smart\n            investment for increasing communal fiscal space and tax\n            revenues, using in-kind contributions of beneficiaries\n            provides a greater flexibility in financing local\n            development; however, this mode of financing is also source\n            of quality issues and implementation difficulties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Community Development Program\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Community Development\n            Program

       Support Project (PAPNDP) is the first phase of the program.\n            Its objective is to assist the Government of Cameroon in\n            setting up and implementing a decentralized financing\n            mechanism to ensure participatory community development in\n            rural areas. The project has the following four components:\n            Component 1) The Community Development Program Support\n            Project (PAPNDP) would channel grants to rural\n            community-based organizations (CBOs with legal status) and\n            rural communes to cofinance their proposed subprojects to\n            reduce poverty by addressing their priority needs. Communes\n            will have ownership of all infrastructure, whether the\n            subproject has been requested by a community or not. When a\n            communal subproject has been approved, the Provincial\n            Project Unit (PPU) would transfer a grant to an account\n            opened by the commune. For a community-based organization\n            subproject, the commune would sign an agreement with the\n            Community-Based Organization (CBO) to delegate\n            implementation and management responsibilities. The\n            community-based organization and the commune would open a\n            joint account to receive the grant. Component 2) aims to\n            strengthen local governance to give accountable\n            decentralized authorities the legal authority and human and\n            financial resources needed for local development. It\n            includes three subcomponents. 2.1 Support to the\n            finalization of the legal and regulatory framework for local\n            Governance; 2.2 Capacity building for communes; 2.3\n            Sensitization on decentralization Component 3) aims to\n            strengthen and empower communities to get involved in\n            decision-making and have an active role in local\n            development. It includes two subcomponents: 3.1. Support for\n            preparation of local and communal development plans,\n            subprojects, and implementation; 3.2 Specific training and\n            outreach campaigns to improve communities' livelihoods\n            and reduce poverty. Component 4) aims to allow all actors of\n            the project and the rural and local development sector in\n            general to share information and tools. This component\n            includes three subcomponents: 4.1 Management and\n            coordination; 4.2 Project monitoring and evaluation; 4.3 Communication."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
