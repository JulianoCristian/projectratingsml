The objectives of the project were aimed at improving\n            economic and financial management by: (i) reinforcing\n            controls on public expenditures;( ii) improving the revenue\n            collection system;( iii) restructuring the public service\n            sector; (iv) inducing economic growth by improving the\n            incentives framework for the private sector; (v) improving\n            the resource allocation process; (vi) improving policies for\n            the management of human and physical resources; and (vii)\n            improving the quality and implementation of the public\n            investment program. Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (a) the assessment\n            of ERCs in such cases would require that the credit be\n            judged on its own merit, rather than being clouded by the\n            progress of otherwise long term continuing reforms; (b) a\n            better understanding of the need and rational for reforms by\n            the different political, interest and pressure groups and to\n            ensure greater assimilation and ownership within the\n            administration; (c) the setting of reform objectives and the\n            timetable for their implementation must be realistic and\n            take into account the risks inherent in a pluralistic\n            political situation where coalition-building and consensual\n            decision making are the name of the game; and (d) in the\n            final analysis, the success of a reform program and its\n            effective implementation depend to a large extent on the\n            political will and unequivocal commitment of the government\n            to undertake reforms, the existing institutional capacity to\n            implement the reforms, a realistic design of the program\n            taking into account local absorptive capacity, and an\n            adequate awareness of the stakeholders of the need for reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Economic Recovery Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Economic Recovery Credit

         effective January 12, 1994. The Economic Recovery Credit\n            Project will support the post-devaluation reform program as\n            outlined in the government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policy, and, more particularly, the measures aimed at\n            minimizing the negative social impact of the devaluation in\n            the short-term; and to provide the necessary financial\n            assistance during the transition period in which follow-up\n            operations are being prepared to support further structural\n            and sectoral reforms. The Nigerian government has already\n            taken a series of key macroeconomic and structural measures\n            to regain and consolidate competitiveness. The credit is\n            designed to support the implementation of these measures in\n            1994. The major measures are: (a) the devaluation of the CFA\n            franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF/1 FF; (b) tax measures to\n            increase fiscal revenue; (c) a substantial program of social\n            measures to attenuate the effects of the devaluation on\n            vulnerable groups, including increasing significantly in\n            real terms current expenditure for health and education; (d)\n            prudent demand management policies to reduce absorption by\n            the public sector and limit wage increases; and (e)\n            reduction of external
