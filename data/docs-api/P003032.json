The Project faces few technical, commercial or\n            managerial risks. There are some risks of delays in Project\n            implementation due to the general economic conditions in\n            Zaire. The main risks will be a deterioration of the\n            Company's financial situation if the government failed\n            to increase sugar prices to reflect production costs, or to\n            provide foreign exchange to purchase agricultural inputs,\n            spare parts and supplies. To reduce these risks, the\n            Government has agreed that sugar prices will be reviewed\n            whenever required and has established a mechanism to\n            allocate foreign
