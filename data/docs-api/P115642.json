Some lessons\n            learned included: the innovative nature of the project, with\n            a limited number of key conditions designed to speed up\n            sector reforms, building entirely on existing dialogue and\n            ongoing bank financed sector operations, allowed the project\n            to disburse 63 percent of funds in four months. Usefulness\n            of relying on existing structures to implement an emergency\n            project. Possibility of targeting funds from payment of the\n            government's utility bills. However, the approach does\n            not allow attribution of utilization of the funds by the two\n            companies and future operations should weigh the objective\n            of crisis response against a more clear focus on\n            demonstrated impacts on the ground. The system of\n            reimbursement of teacher salaries allows verification that\n            funds go towards reimbursing the government for services\n            actually delivered by teachers.

The Emergency Project to Mitigate the Impact of\n            the Financial Crisis (EPMIFC) will finance the short-term\n            costs associated with: (i) the import of essential goods and\n            commodities, (ii) the salaries of teachers in the primary\n            and secondary education sector, and (iii) the State water\n            and electricity bills. It would assure that economic\n            activities relying on imports can continue uninterrupted and\n            protect the functioning of essential social and utility\n            services. In line with the Bank's rapid response policy\n            on emergencies and crisis, this grant would support measures\n            to mitigate or avert the impact of the financial crisis on\n
