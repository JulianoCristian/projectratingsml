Some lessons learned included: the link\n            between the effects of the Human Resources Management (HRM)\n            reform program and its impact on the size of the wage bill\n            has not been strong and future Public Administration Reform\n            Loan (PARL) should consider how to strengthen this linkage.\n            Containing the wage bill appears to have been less difficult\n            than anticipated since program measures were completed. Yet\n            resisting political pressure to raise salaries is difficult\n            for any government and should be prevented with sound\n            analytical capacity and adequate solutions. Reforms\n            requiring inter-ministerial coordination have moved slowly;\n            thus attention needs to be placed on how to strengthen\n            coordination. The spirit of public sector reform in Morocco\n            lies in adequate coordination across ministries. The\n            programmatic adjustment loan appears to be the appropriate\n            instrument for supporting public sector reforms in Morocco\n            as the country is proceeding step by step in a medium term\n            program. Morocco is a good case of using successive single\n            tranche adjustment loans as an effective way to assist\n            structural reform, provided there is a link to an agreed\n            medium-term reform program with well broadly defined\n            milestones and transparent triggers per subsequent\n            operation. Moroccan experience in multiplicating the number\n            of monitoring indicators has generated an unmanageably large\n            number of them, which prevents their effectiveness to\n            measure performance. Monitoring indicators should be limited\n            to a small number of the most pertinent measures and\n            performance audits should be simplified in order to make the\n            process more manageable, and reporting be made more timely."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - First and Second Public\n            Administration Reform Adjustment Loan Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - First and Second Public\n            Administration Reform Adjustment Loan Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/06/10952134/morocco-first-second-public-administration-reform-adjustment-loan-projects","projn":"MA-Morocco - Second Public Administration\n            Development Policy Loan -- P089677,MA-Morocco - Public Admin.

A\n            first loan was approved by the Bank Board on July 1, 2004.\n            The objectives of the proposed loan are to support the\n            Government's continuous efforts to improve the\n            effectiveness of public resource management, a key step for\n            increasing growth and improving the quality of public\n            services. The reform program supported by the P-DPLs\n            includes three components: (a) budgetary reforms designed to\n            improve the efficiency of public expenditure, (b) a reform\n            of civil service management, and (c) measures to keep the\n            wage bill at a sustainable level over time. All three\n            components have both short term impacts on the current\n            management systems and longer term effects resulting in a\n            structural change in these systems. In parallel, the reform\n            program is supported by a Programmatic Economic and Sector\n            Work (P-ESW) activity through which the Bank is providing\n            the Government with advice, training, and knowledge transfer\n            as required in the areas of budgetary management, civil\n            service reform, and wage bill containment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maroc - Deuxieme Pret a l'Appui des\n            Politiques de Developpement pour la Reforme de\n            l'Administration Publique (PARAP II)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Maroc - Deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019appui\n            des politiques de d\u00e9veloppement pour la r\u00e9forme de\n            l\u2019administration publique : Maroc\u00a0- Deuxi\u00e8me pr\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019appui\n            des politiques de d\u00e9veloppement pour la r\u00e9forme de\n            l\u2019administration publique (PARAP II)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/02/6640382/morocco-second-public-administration-development-policy-loan-project-maroc-deuxieme-pret-lappui-des-politiques-de-developpement-pour-la-reforme-de-ladministration-publique-parap-ii","projn":"MA-Morocco - Second Public Administration\n            Development Policy Loan -- P089677","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Business Environment,Public Sector Economics,Economic Theory & Research,Business in Development,Public Sector Management and Reform","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060307083801"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, administrative decentralization,\n            agricultural output, Agriculture, appropriations, budget\n            deficits, budget reform, centralization, competitiveness,\n            comptrollers, debt, debt management, decentralization,\n            DEVELOPMENT POLICY, Economic growth, Economic Sector Work,\n            economic situation, exports, Financial Accountability,\n            financial management, financial sector, fiscal deficits,\n            GDP, GDP deflator, government debt, Gross Domestic Product,\n            growth potential, growth rate, Housing, income taxes,\n            indexation, inflation, Inflation rate, inflation rates,\n            INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, interest rates, liquidity,\n            living standards, Local Governments, macroeconomic\n            management, macroeconomic stability, Middle East, national\n            income, North Africa, price increases, private sector,\n            provisions, PUBLIC, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, Public\n            Administration Reform, public debt, public employees, public\n            expenditure, public expenditure management, public\n            expenditure management system, public financial management,\n            public investment, public investment in infrastructure,\n            public resources, public resources management, PUBLIC\n            SECTOR, public service, public service delivery, public\n            services, public spending, public wage, Public works, Real\n            GDP, revenue performance, savings, structural change,\n            structural reforms, Tax, Tax revenues, technical assistance,\n            trade deficit, trade liberalization, transparency,\n            unemployment, unemployment rate, Value Added, Wages"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduct & Econ.
