Lessons indicate: 1) The timeframe of\n            water sector reforms and sequencing of various steps, should\n            be carefully designed to take full account of their links\n            with economic, legal, and other reforms upon which they\n            depend. The restructuring of Regional Water Companies (RWCs)\n            was linked with the legal issue of asset transfer, delayed\n            because the new water law to cover the ownership of assets\n            had not been enacted. Similarly, decisions on tariffs and\n            other financial matters depend on the autonomy of the\n            entity, and the steps it must take to improve its finances.\n            RWCs are still subject to political pressure, which tends to\n            delay decisions on critical financial issues. 2) The project\n            components should be in line with project objectives, scale\n            of operation, goals, and funding; with defined components\n            and measurable targets. The objectives of this project were\n            rather broad, emphasizing system-wide operational\n            improvements. The project components, on the other hand,\n            were designed to initiate many of the improvements in\n            different zones on a pilot scale with corresponding limited\n            funding. As a result, achievements do not fully meet the set\n            objectives and goals, although they are quite reasonable if\n            compared to the limited scope of activities and respective\n            volume of funding. 3) Simple, straightforward components\n            often produce efficient results. The district heating\n            component is an excellent example of a clear and practical\n            project design. It was well defined, highly relevant, and\n            was implemented through an effective operator within the\n            given period, including with some cost savings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -

Water Companies Restructuring\n            and Modernization Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            while project sustainability is regarded as likely. The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            evaluated as satisfactory. The project was one of the first\n            investment operations for the Bank in Bulgaria. The broad\n            sector reform objectives of the project allowed\n            institutional reforms to take place and made an impact in\n            the water and wastewater and the district heating sectors as\n            described earlier. However, there may have been some\n            optimism in the pace of reform that could take place. 1)\n            Investment projects should be designed in line with the\n            macro-economic conditions in the country. The primary delay\n            in the early stages of the project was due to the fact that\n            the regional water companies (RWCs) could not afford to take\n            on the sub-loans when tariffs were low and prospects of\n            increasing them fast were not high. This was further\n            complicated by the fact that the Bulgarian leva was not\n            stable against the US Dollar, prior to the Currency Board\n            being established, and the on-lending interest was high. 2)\n            Projects should be simple, have limited objectives, and\n            success should be defined during preparation. For example,\n            if there were less objectives under the water component,\n            project implementation would be more focused. For the\n            future, projects with limited objectives and possibility of\n            a repeat operation by the Bank should be considered. 3)\n            Decentralization should be linked to fiscal and\n            administrative autonomy. the transfer of shares to the\n            municipality should have been linked to greater fiscal and\n            administrative autonomy at the local level. Under the\n            project, the municipalities owned part of the assets but did\n            not have the ability to take independent decisions about\n            raising tariffs or taxes and operations of the RWCs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -

The\n            non-revenue water reduction window will respond to the\n            emerging incentives for water companies to reduce water\n            losses and to improve their operating efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Water Companies Restructuring and\n            Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Water Companies\n            Restructuring and Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/05/733020/bulgaria-water-companies-restructuring-modernization-project","projn":"BG-Water Companies Rest -- P008319","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bulgaria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005070911"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Water supply","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"capacity building,cash flow,competitive\n            bidding,conserve water,Construction,construction\n            activities,cost recovery,debt,decision making,economic\n            growth,employment,environmental benefits,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            protection,exchange rate,expenditures,financial\n            resources,income,international waters,investment\n            financing,Investment Planning,Investment Program,investment\n            proposals,local authorities,local ownership,management of\n            water,municipal companies,Municipal Water,performance\n            indicators,Pipeline,programs,Project Management,public\n            health,Pumping,quantity of water,Regional\n            Development,riparian,riparian countries,riparian\n            issues,river water,Rivers,sanitation sector,sanitation\n            services,sewage treatment,Sewerage Companies,sewerage\n            systems,structural adjustment,surface water,sustainable\n            development,tariff policies,utilities,wastewater,wastewater\n            treatment,Water Companies,water company,water demand,water\n            demand management,water extraction,water quality,water\n            resources,water resources management,water sector,water\n            shortages,water supply,waterways"},"1":{"cdata!":"capacity building,cash flow,competitive\n            bidding,conserve water,Construction,construction\n            activities,cost recovery,debt,decision making,economic\n            growth,employment,environmental benefits,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            protection,exchange rate,expenditures,financial\n            resources,income,international waters,investment\n            financing,Investment Planning,Investment Program,investment\n            proposals,local authorities,local ownership,management of\n            water,municipal companies,Municipal Water,performance\n            indicators,Pipeline,programs,Project Management,public\n            health,Pumping,quantity of water,Regional\n            Development,riparian,riparian countries,riparian\n            issues,river water,Rivers,sanitation sector,sanitation\n            services,sewage treatment,Sewerage Companies,sewerage\n            systems,structural adjustment,surface water,sustainable\n            development,tariff policies,utilities,wastewater,wastewater\n            treatment,Water Companies,water company,water demand,water\n            demand management,water extraction,water quality,water\n            resources,water resources management,water sector,water\n            shortages,water supply,waterways"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF040878-RUSSIAN FEDERATION: WATER\n            SUPPLY PROJECT,TF039948-BULGARIA-WATER COMPANIES\n            RESTRUCTURING AND MODERNIZATION,TF036363-ECA REGION - DISTRICT HEATING\n            AND POWER PROJECTS (LITHUANIA,,TF033935-BULGARIA - WATER COMPANIES\n            RESTRUCTURING  CANCELED,TF033329-BULGARIA - WATER COMPANIES\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJECT,TF022906-PHRD-WATER & SANITATION PROJECT,TF023058-PHRD-WATER & SANITATION","repnb":"P6160"},"facets":{}}}
