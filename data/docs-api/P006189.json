Some\n            lessons learned included: strong technical leadership is\n            vital for setting the direction for the project. The\n            turnover of project directors impacted negatively during the\n            project's first four years of execution, and should be\n            based on ability rather than constant changes in political\n            orientation/leadership within the government. Stronger\n            conditions performance reviews on this aspect should be\n            specified in the project's credit covenants. Continual\n            integration and coordination of the major users in the\n            government is a key element for the development of accepted\n            financial information systems. Coordination of the system\n            entails a great deal of commitment by executing agencies to\n            the concept of efficiency and transparency. Integration and\n            user consultation prevents uneven, unharmonized development\n            of sub-systems (e.g.: budget, accounting, cash) caused by\n            turf struggles among decision makers responsible for\n            managing each functional area. The importance of project\n            ownership by the government and the implementing agency\n            cannot be overemphasized, as shown in this case where the\n            Comptroller General of the Republic's (CGR's)\n            ownership of its component remained constant, and, by being\n            an autonomous agency was not affected by other government\n            policies, whereas the Ministry of Finance's\n            (MOF's) priorities and ownership of the project\n            fluctuated throughout project execution, not in the least\n            due to the frequent turnover in the executives of the ministry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Second Public Financial Management\n            Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Second Public
