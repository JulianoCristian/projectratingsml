Jointly PAFA and\n            DPA will develop the capacity to assist CAs with preparation\n            of additional subprojects and to appraise and supervise\n            them. The third element of the project is designed to\n            stimulate intensive analysis of socio-cultural constraints\n            to fertility reduction, review relevant experiences from\n            other countries, and design innovative interventions for\n            adoption by implementing CAs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - National Population Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - National Population Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/04/736285/nigeria-national-population-project","projn":"NG-Population -- P002094","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,m,Demographics,Health Information & Communications Technologies,Health Indicators","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960929052914"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"age distribution,Age Specific Fertility\n            Rates,birth rate,Birth Rates,breastfeeding,census,child\n            health services,childbearing,cities,clinics,condoms,crude\n            birth rate,CURRENCY,death rate,Death\n            Rates,deaths,demographic data,demographic\n            projections,demographic surveys,employment,families,Family\n            Planning,family size,female\n            sterilization,girls,health,health centers,Health\n            Education,Health Services,hospitals,housing,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rates,infants,intrauterine\n            devices,IUDs,live births,managers,married women,mass\n            media,maternal deaths,migration,Mortality,Mortality\n            Rates,mothers,motivation,nutrition,pharmacies,pill,policy\n            document,population,Population Activities,population\n            assistance,population change,population data,population\n            education,population estimates,population growth,population\n            growth rate,Population Indicators,Population\n            Information,population issues,population policies,Population\n            Policy,population programs,Population Research,Primary\n            Health Care,Primary Schools,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,quality of life,radio,Regional\n            Population,secondary schools,sexually transmitted\n            diseases,social services,sterilization,TFR,Total Fertility\n            Rate,total population,urbanization,World Fertility\n            Survey,young people,youth unemployment"},"1":{"cdata!":"age distribution,Age Specific Fertility\n            Rates,birth rate,Birth Rates,breastfeeding,census,child\n            health services,childbearing,cities,clinics,condoms,crude\n            birth rate,CURRENCY,death rate,Death\n            Rates,deaths,demographic data,demographic\n            projections,demographic surveys,employment,families,Family\n            Planning,family size,female\n            sterilization,girls,health,health centers,Health\n            Education,Health Services,hospitals,housing,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rates,infants,intrauterine\n            devices,IUDs,live births,managers,married women,mass\n            media,maternal deaths,migration,Mortality,Mortality\n            Rates,mothers,motivation,nutrition,pharmacies,pill,policy\n            document,population,Population Activities,population\n            assistance,population change,population data,population\n            education,population estimates,population growth,population\n            growth rate,Population Indicators,Population\n            Information,population issues,population policies,Population\n            Policy,population programs,Population Research,Primary\n            Health Care,Primary Schools,private sector,public\n            health,public sector,quality of life,radio,Regional\n            Population,secondary schools,sexually transmitted\n            diseases,social services,sterilization,TFR,Total Fertility\n            Rate,total population,urbanization,World Fertility\n            Survey,young people,youth unemployment"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 3 (AFTH3)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF024950-INDIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF020350-DANISH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF033200-NIGERIA - NATIONAL POPULATION PROJECT,TF032835-NIGERIA - NATIONAL POPULATION PROJECT","repnb":"8527"},"facets":{}}}
