Several lessons\n            emerge: The medium- and long-term sustainability of a\n            country's reform program depends on having provincial\n            governments that do not generate excessive fiscal deficits\n            and are efficient providers of services. Multi-sectoral\n            loans can be effective tools in doing the groundwork for\n            reform. By being willing to take a moderate risk in\n            approving the project under still unstable macroeconomic\n            conditions, the Bank was able to help Argentina capitalize\n            on the unique window of opportunity that opened after the\n            Convertibility Law. Enhanced responsibilities for\n            sub-national governments contribute to strong ownership of\n            the project as well as \"hands-on\" capacity\n            building. Simplify as much as possible all review,\n            procurement, and disbursement procedures. Do not expect\n            multi-sectoral projects to disburse quickly and easily at\n            first. Develop a portfolio of alternative sources of\n            financing for provincial investment to increase reform\n            leverage. Adequate supervision resources should be made\n            available. Having the provincial finance ministers as\n            counterparts served to keep the focus on reform-oriented\n            sub-projects. To improve quality control of the portfolio in\n            multi-sectoral operations, the subcontracting of supervision\n            activities should be considered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
