As the MGAs' resources increase from new member\n            subscriptions and from interest earned on their equity, the\n            matching loan will be repaid and the funds will be used to\n            assist new MGAs.  The average size of subloans to individual\n            enterprises is expected to be about US$10,000. Technical\n            assistance will be provided to help establish and monitor\n            the MGAs; train key staff of the MGAs; provide advice on\n            waste minimization and treatment; oversee the implementation\n            of the program; and train personnel in the retail banks to\n            deal with the MGAs under the programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Cottage Enterprise Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Cottage Enterprise\n            Finance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/12/737934/philippines-cottage-enterprise-finance-project","projn":"PH-Cottage Enterprise -- P004581","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Private Participation in Infrastructure,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960929162145"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other finance","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Auditing,autonomy,bank\n            lending,banking sector,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,borrower,borrowing,borrowings,branches,capital\n            adequacy,Capital Markets,capital requirements,Central\n            Bank,charter,commercial\n            banks,commitment,commitments,company,corporate\n            finance,corporation,credit policies,debt,deposit\n            protection,deposits,Disbursement,Disbursements,Employment,Enterprise\n            Development,Enterprise\n            Finance,entrepreneurs,expansion,financial crisis,financial\n            institutions,financial markets,Financial\n            Performance,financial services,financial structure,financing\n            gap,firms,FISCAL YEAR,fixed asset,Foreign Exchange,funds\n            flow,Guidelines,interest income,interest rates,internal\n            controls,laws,lender,lending policies,Lending\n            Terms,licensing,liquid assets,Liquidity,Loan,loan\n            approvals,Loan Defaults,loan maturity,loan\n            size,Manufacturers,Matching Funds,merchant\n            banking,mortgages,onlending,Operating\n            Expenses,privatization,productivity,recession,regulatory\n            framework,Relending,reorganization,resource\n            mobilization,retail banks,return on assets,securities,small\n            firms,Subborrowers,subloans,Subsidiary,syndicated\n            loans,Technical Assistance,term finance,terms of\n            lending,transport,trust funds,venture capital,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Auditing,autonomy,bank\n            lending,banking sector,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,borrower,borrowing,borrowings,branches,capital\n            adequacy,Capital Markets,capital requirements,Central\n            Bank,charter,commercial\n            banks,commitment,commitments,company,corporate\n            finance,corporation,credit policies,debt,deposit\n            protection,deposits,Disbursement,Disbursements,Employment,Enterprise\n            Development,Enterprise\n            Finance,entrepreneurs,expansion,financial crisis,financial\n            institutions,financial markets,Financial\n            Performance,financial services,financial structure,financing\n            gap,firms,FISCAL YEAR,fixed asset,Foreign Exchange,funds\n            flow,Guidelines,interest income,interest rates,internal\n            controls,laws,lender,lending policies,Lending\n            Terms,licensing,liquid assets,Liquidity,Loan,loan\n            approvals,Loan Defaults,loan maturity,loan\n            size,Manufacturers,Matching Funds,merchant\n            banking,mortgages,onlending,Operating\n            Expenses,privatization,productivity,recession,regulatory\n            framework,Relending,reorganization,resource\n            mobilization,retail banks,return on assets,securities,small\n            firms,Subborrowers,subloans,Subsidiary,syndicated\n            loans,Technical Assistance,term finance,terms of\n            lending,transport,trust funds,venture capital,working capital"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"9030"},"facets":{}}}
