The lessons learned indicate that clearly, the\n            province's priority was the construction of the\n            expressways. The Provincial Transport Department (FPECD) was\n            placed directly under a Vice-Governor of the province and\n            became de-facto on par with, rather than under the (FPTD).\n            The one-year delay in project completion is attributable to\n            the delay in the electrical and mechanical (E&M)\n            procurement and works. Toll rates on the project expressways\n            are high. They are comparable to rates charged for instance\n            in France with a much higher level of income than China. As\n            a result, diversion to the expressways is only half as much\n            as forecast, about 40% instead of 74%. This lower than\n            expected diversion is also due to the wide spacing of the\n            interchanges (15 to 18 km)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Fujian Provincial Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
