Thermal Power Efficiency Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Thermal Power Efficiency Project for\n            China received a satisfactory outcome rating with moderate\n            risk to global environment outcome. Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower received moderately satisfactory ratings for their\n            performances. The project was restructured three times. The\n            first restructuring extended the closing date by one year to\n            allow the project implementing agencies to complete the\n            planned project activities and achieve the project\n            development objective. The second restructuring included the\n            following changes: (1) amend the intermediate output\n            indicators; (2) adjust the project components; and (3)\n            adjust the implementation arrangement to include new\n            implementing agencies. The adjustment of the project\n            components included: (1) the scope of Part A of the Project\n            was reduced due to cancellation of two activities; and (2)\n            the scope of Part B of the Project was expanded to include\n            the rehabilitations of three additional power plants. As a\n            result, part of the GEF grant was reallocated from Part A to\n            Part B of the Project. The third restructuring saw the\n            closing date extend by another six months in order to\n            complete the pending national level studies and maximize the\n            influence of the project. The following lessons were learned\n            from this project: (1) Strong government commitment is\n            critical for project success, and the GOC has shown strong\n            ownership of the promotion of energy conservation to reduce\n            overall energy intensity. (2) Project design aligned with\n            country priorities. (3) Strong technical and financial\n            capacity of implementing agencies. The results of the plant\n            thermal efficiency improvement component are considered\n            highly satisfactory because the measured results indicators\n            well exceed the original targets. (4) Significant\n            demonstration effect of rehabilitation as a result of the\n            proper selection of technology (based on its competitiveness\n            and replication potential) and extensive dissemination\n            activities. (6) Although the two PDO level indicators are\n            appropriate for measuring the success of the aggregated\n            efficiency improvements and GHG impacts in the power sector\n            in the three provinces, additional indicators would have\n            provided more precise measurement of the output of the\n            project to enhance attribution, as the size of the GEF\n            project was quite small compared to the size of the sector\n            in the three provinces. (7) Flexibility is required to adapt\n            project implementation to evolving government priorities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Thermal Power Efficiency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -

This project restructuring\n            does not result in any change in the project objective. The\n            restructuring makes the following changes to the Project:\n            (1) trigger a new safeguard policy - Safety of Dams (OP/BP\n            4.37); (2) amend the intermediate output indicators; (3)\n            adjust the project components; and (4) adjust the\n            implementation arrangement to include new implementing\n            agencies. The proposed adjustment of the project components\n            include: (1) the scope of Part A of the Project is reduced\n            due to cancellation of two activities (closure of small\n            power plants and CHP online monitoring system in Shanxi\n            province); and (2) the scope of Part B of the Project is\n            expanded to include the rehabilitations of three additional\n            power plants, including: Weihai power plant in Shandong\n            province, Wuxiang Power Plant and Taiyuan No. 1 Power Plant\n            in Shanxi province. As a result, part of the GEF grant is\n            reallocated from Part A to Part B of the Project. The\n            proposed changes are in response to the request of the\n            Government of China (GoC) made through three letters from\n            the Ministry of Finance dated November 3, 2011, February 7\n            and November 9, 2012. The changes aim to provide timely\n            support to the GoC's priority actions in improving the\n            efficiency of thermal power in China. The government put\n            closure of small generation units as a priority action in\n            its 11th Five-Year period (2006-2010) and aimed to complete\n            the rehabilitation of medium-size coal-fired thermal power\n            plants in its 12th Five-Year period (2011-2015). The\n            re-allocation of the GEF grant in the proposed project\n            restructuring is consistent with the GOC's priority\n            actions in both periods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - GEF China Thermal Power Efficiency\n            Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - GEF China Thermal Power\n            Efficiency Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/12/17187092/china-gef-china-thermal-power-efficiency-project-restructuring","projn":"CN-Thermal Power Efficiency -- P098654","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Housing & Human Habitats,Dams and Reservoirs,Power & Energy Conversion","teratopic":"Environment,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000425962_20130117104314"},"theme":"Climate change,Rural services and infrastructure,Pollution management and environmental health,Environmental policies and institutions","subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power,Public administration- Energy and mining","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Carbon, Carbon Dioxide, civil works, coal,\n            coal consumption, combustion, dam, dam owners, dam safety,\n            dam safety measures, Dams, Electricity, Electricity\n            Generation, electricity production, emission, emission per\n            unit, emission reduction, emission trading, emissions,\n            Environmental Assessment, environmental impacts,\n            Environmental Management, Environmental Protection, existing\n            dams, financial viability, flue gas, generation units,\n            Global Environment, greenhouse, greenhouse gas, greenhouse\n            gas emissions, Grid, Grid Power, Heat, heat exchangers,\n            Indigenous Peoples, mitigation measures, Natural Habitats,\n            Nitrogen Oxide, pollutants, Power Company, Power Generation,\n            Power Plant, power plants, reservoir, Resettlement,\n            Safeguard Policies, Safety, Sustainable Development, thermal\n            efficiency, THERMAL POWER, thermal power plants, waste,\n            water from reservoirs"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia Sustainable Dev (EASCS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF090221-GEF PPG - CHINA: GEF GRANT FOR\n            PREPARATION OF THE PROPOSED THERMAL POWE,TF094204-CHINA THERMAL POWER EFFICIENCY PROJECT","majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management","repnb":"74143"},"facets":{}}}
