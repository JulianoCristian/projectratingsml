However, the perception by\n            investors on the country's risks, and the limited\n            capacities at the early stages of the project, affected\n            implementation, and outcome. But sustainability is very\n            likely, and both the Bank, and the Borrower's\n            performances were highly satisfactory. Lessons drawn from\n            the project, suggest that multidimensional programs, require\n            political considerations, in synergy with the technical\n            work, to be supported by commitments at the highest level of\n            Government, to ensure successful privatization programs. The\n            government provided this commitment, and allowed time to\n            evaluate options, and consultations with stakeholders, as\n            well as ways to resolve complex privatization issues.\n            However, specific policies, and actions for private sector\n            development should be closely linked, but it appears that\n            the Government gave priority to the pace of divestiture, and\n            to revenue maximization, over the objective of broadening\n            local share ownership, somehow preventing complete success\n            of the privatization process. Nonetheless, institutional\n            strengthening played a key role in the privatization\n            program, and debt management, due to the work of a highly\n            selected team, and the right training. Legislation, and\n            related reforms should be established to attract foreign investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Privatization Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire -\n            Privatization Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/04/728783/cote-divoire-privatization-support-project","projn":"CI-Privatization Support -- P001207","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Housing Finance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00042605311373"},"subsc":"Capital markets,Central government administration,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,agriculture,Bank\n            Performance,bilateral debt,bonds,book value,budget\n            deficit,budget deficits,capacity building,capital\n            market,capital\n            markets,capitalization,centralization,commercial\n            creditors,commercial\n            debt,competitiveness,consumers,corporate taxes,Debt,debt\n            relief,debt restructuring,debt\n            servicing,deficits,devaluation,development\n            strategy,disclosure,disequilibrium,economic\n            efficiency,economic situation,employment,exports,financial\n            information,financial institutions,financial\n            management,financial markets,FISCAL YEAR,GDP,Government\n            finance,income levels,Institutional Development,investment\n            bankers,investment banks,labor productivity,large public\n            enterprises,legislation,London Club,macroeconomic\n            policies,Privatization,productivity,profitability,public\n            debt,Public Enterprises,public finance,real GDP,real\n            sector,regulatory framework,reorganization,resource\n            allocation,savings,shareholders,shareholding,stabilization,technical assistance,Telecommunications,transport,valuation"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,agriculture,Bank\n            Performance,bilateral debt,bonds,book value,budget\n            deficit,budget deficits,capacity building,capital\n            market,capital\n            markets,capitalization,centralization,commercial\n            creditors,commercial\n            debt,competitiveness,consumers,corporate taxes,Debt,debt\n            relief,debt restructuring,debt\n            servicing,deficits,devaluation,development\n            strategy,disclosure,disequilibrium,economic\n            efficiency,economic situation,employment,exports,financial\n            information,financial institutions,financial\n            management,financial markets,FISCAL YEAR,GDP,Government\n            finance,income levels,Institutional Development,investment\n            bankers,investment banks,labor productivity,large public\n            enterprises,legislation,London Club,macroeconomic\n            policies,Privatization,productivity,profitability,public\n            debt,Public Enterprises,public finance,real GDP,real\n            sector,regulatory framework,reorganization,resource\n            allocation,savings,shareholders,shareholding,stabilization,technical assistance,Telecommunications,transport,valuation"}},"owner":"AFT: Private Sector (AFTPS)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF025398-PHRD INFRACSTRUCTURE ACTION\n            PROGRAM(COUNTRY FRAMEWORK PAPERS),TF022650-ENERGY SECTOR ADJUSTMENT,TF022223-CANADIAN CTF FOR SUSTAINABLE DEV.-POP.,TF035371-COTE D'IVOIRE -\n            PRIVATIZATION SUPPORT,TF033656-AFRICA -
