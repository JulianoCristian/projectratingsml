Lessons point primarily at\n            the importance of the Government's active program of\n            privatization, and regulatory development, which ran in\n            parallel with the investments financed by the project,\n            allowing maximum benefits deriving from the liberalized\n            energy markets, both Hungarian, and European. However, the\n            reluctance of the Government to expose Hungarian consumers\n            to the full costs of electricity supply - though\n            understandable, but a factor rather to be placed in the\n            context of anti-inflation and other policy considerations -\n            constraints the ability of the Hungarian Power Company, to\n            confidently plan sector needs, weakening the company's\n            creditworthiness. Thus, the issue of independent energy\n            regulation and economic pricing, remain indicators to\n            monitor, and evaluate, well after restructuring, and\n            privatization. Nevertheless, the highly professional, and\n            motivated management provided by the power company, was a\n            crucial ingredient for success, which underlines the\n

Issues\n            addressed by the study are: 1) what types of the\n            environmental impacts can be expected? 2) to what degree is\n            the impact expected to exert itself? 3) when is it due to\n            occur and how long will it last? 4) who or what will be\n            affected? and 5) will it endanger or keep the environmental\n            control limits?  This study describes the purpose of the\n            project and summarizes the expected results.  It analyses\n            the possible alternatives and arrives at the conclusion that\n            the implementation of the long-term development of the\n            electric power system proved to be the most advantageous."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Energy environment project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Hungary - Energy environment\n            project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/10/699555/hungary-energy-environment-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"HU-Energy Environment Project -- P008479","subtopic":"Transport and Environment,Montreal Protocol,Pollution Management & Control,Carbon Policy and Trading,Water and Industry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Hungary","authors":{"authr":"Hungary"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970625092200"},"subsc":"Power,Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"affected parties,air pollutant,air pollutant\n            emissions,air pollutants,air pollution,air quality,Air\n            Quality Control,air quality limits,ambient air,ambient air\n            pollution,ambient air quality,ambient noise,annual\n            emissions,aromatic hydrocarbons,background\n            pollution,cadmium,calculation,concentrations,construction,conversion\n            efficiency,cycle,cycle gas,dioxide emissions,district\n            heating,dust,environmental impact,environmental impact\n            assessment,environmental impacts,gas,gas,gas emission,gas\n            emissions,gas supply,gas turbine,gas\n            turbines,habitats,health conditions,heavy\n            metals,hydrology,metals,nickel,nitrogen,nitrogen\n            oxides,noise control,noise pollution,particle\n            emissions,particles,power plants,Power Station,protected\n            areas,restrictions,soot,sulfur,sulfur-\n            dioxide,sulfur-dioxide,total emissions,total\n            energy,towns,turbine plant,vanadium,water supply,xylene"},"1":{"cdata!":"affected parties,air pollutant,air pollutant\n            emissions,air pollutants,air pollution,air quality,Air\n            Quality Control,air quality limits,ambient air,ambient air\n            pollution,ambient air quality,ambient noise,annual\n            emissions,aromatic hydrocarbons,background\n            pollution,cadmium,calculation,concentrations,construction,conversion\n            efficiency,cycle,cycle gas,dioxide emissions,district\n            heating,dust,environmental impact,environmental impact\n            assessment,environmental impacts,gas,gas,gas emission,gas\n            emissions,gas supply,gas turbine,gas\n            turbines,habitats,health conditions,heavy\n            metals,hydrology,metals,nickel,nitrogen,nitrogen\n            oxides,noise control,noise pollution,particle\n            emissions,particles,power plants,Power Station,protected\n            areas,restrictions,soot,sulfur,sulfur-\n            dioxide,sulfur-dioxide,total emissions,total\n            energy,towns,turbine plant,vanadium,water supply,xylene"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF026081-USTDA CTF,TF026080-USTDP ENVIRONMENTAL\n            CONSL'T TRUST FUND,TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF033544-HUNGARY - ENERGY","repnb":"E81"},"facets":{}}}
