Three lessons may be\n            drawn from the implementation of the Guinea PEMAC. First,\n            the use of an adjustment lending facility to support an\n            overhaul of a country public expenditure management should\n            be complemented by investment or technical support that\n            addresses the capacity issue. Attention should be paid to\n            careful sequencing with related operations dealing with\n            capacity building. Second, Guinea's experience shows\n            that a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) should cover\n            all government budget, not just selected priority sectors or\n            components of the priority sector budgets. Nevertheless, it\n            is important not to overestimate implementation capacity of\n            government. When weak implementation capacity exists, budget\n            process should include: 1) hard budget constraints or\n            ceilings for all ministries including non-MTEF ones, and 2)\n            an explicit adjustment mechanism that would permit the\n            reallocation of resources between MTEF and non-MTEF sectors\n            as well as between wage and non-wage recurrent expenditures.\n            Third, in the design of quick-disbursing operations, the\n            choice of impact indicators needs careful reflection so that\n            they are monitorable within the time framework of the\n            operation. Where outcome indicators are not verifiable\n            within the typical period covered by such an operation, one\n            should be content with policy intermediate output indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Public Expenditure Management\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Public Expenditure\n            Management
