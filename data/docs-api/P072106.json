Ratings for\n            the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Poverty Reduction Credit\n            Project for Burkina Faso are as follows: outcomes of the\n            project were satisfactory, sustainability is moderate, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the Borrower was also rated\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the report are: 1)\n            PRSCs are useful instruments to help the borrower assume\n            increased responsibility in managing its public resources in\n            an efficient manner, notably by providing more flexibility\n            and predictability; however, there is a risk of complacency\n            and of dependence on continued foreign budget support; 2)\n            issues of attribution are inevitable when the reform\n            programs are supported by several donors; 3) since outcomes\n            are to be assessed after several years, the quality of the\n            relevant statistical data is critical; if insufficient,\n            preparation should include remedial actions, including the\n            selection and definition of baseline data; 4) since reforms\n            are of medium-to long-term nature, early identification of\n            institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints is of\n            paramount importance; and 5) to assess outcome of a\n            medium-term program, it is essential that the different\n            documents of a PRSC series be consistent in content and\n            format,

Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Poverty Reduction Support Credit for\n            Burkina Faso is designed to support the government's\n            poverty reduction strategy as set out in the June 2000\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The reform paper\n            focuses on improving basic service delivery. This\n            one-tranche operation would be the first of a planned series\n            of three PRSCs with a total amount of US$120 million\n            equivalent, prepared annually within a rolling, three-year\n            horizon. The credit provides financial support tp allow the\n            government to carry out its poverty reduction expenditure\n            program expeditiously and fully. By focusing on economy-wide\n            policy and institutional issues like broad public sector\n            reform, the PRSC is expected to help implement the poverty\n            reduction program in two ways. First, in the short run, the\n            credit helps maintain macroeconomic stability and creates\n            the conditions for accelerating growth by providing\n            quick-disbursing assistance in the context of slow growth\n            and lower-than-expected government revenues. Secondly, the\n            program associated with the credit helps poverty reduction\n            by improving the targeting and effectiveness of public\n            expenditures to the poor and actually channeling public\n            funds to more accountable local spending agencies. By\n            improving the availability and efficient use of public\n            resources for basic public services, and by stressing\n            delegation, accountability, and transparency in budget\n            management, the reform program should improve access to and\n            the quality of these services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Poverty Reduction Support\n
