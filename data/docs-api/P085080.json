Vietnam is to reduce the rate of accidents, injury and\n            death associated with road transport through physical\n            improvement and institutional development to strengthen the\n            management of road transport safety. The extension results\n            from initial procurement delays of over two years in the\n            recruitment of the lead consulting service responsible for\n            overall implementation coordination. Over the last 18 months\n            project implementation has closely followed an agreed\n            detailed implementation schedule that acknowledged a target\n            completion date of June 2012. However, the first credit\n            closing date extension to June 2011 was approved on the\n            basis that consideration of any further extension will be\n            contingent on satisfactory progress in implementing the\n            agreed schedule through June 2011. Apart from a minor\n            slippage in one component, steady progress has been\n            consistent with the agreed schedules and action plans over\n            the last three years. The extension allows for the\n            conclusion of several on-going training activities and, most\n            significantly, completion of substantial packages critical\n            to the full achievement of the project development\n            objectives by ensuring sufficient time for: (i) the\n            acquisition of goods and related user training for rollout\n            of the

The extension results\n            from initial procurement delays of over two years in the\n            recruitment of the lead consulting service responsible for\n            overall implementation coordination.

However, the first credit\n            closing date extension to June 2011 was approved on the\n            basis that consideration of any further extension will be\n            contingent on satisfactory progress in implementing the\n            agreed schedule through June 2011. Apart from a minor\n            slippage in one component, steady progress has been\n            consistent with the agreed schedules and action plans over\n            the last three years.
