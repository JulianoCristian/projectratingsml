Some lessons\n            learned included: Strong political support and government\n            ownership is essential for any program to succeed. This\n            leads to high level of monitoring and oversight. Continuity\n            of the same team over a project, including officials and\n            politicians at various tiers helps maintain momentum of\n            reforms and enhances the probability of success of a\n            program. Success of a program requires a flexible approach\n            to implementation with effective monitoring and evaluation\n            of the program during the implementation process with the\n            help of relevant data and information to identify\n            shortcomings and problem issues and be able to rectify them\n            during the course of implementation. Strong ongoing\n            analytical work helps deepen and refine policies and\n            programs. Finally, the success of any education system is\n            judged by the quality of its graduates. While quality\n            remains the core desired outcome of any education reform\n            program, it takes several years to show tangible results.\n            Therefore, education reforms require a long term commitment,\n            backed by a clear strategy for improving school level\n            performance through both quantitative and qualitative inputs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Punjab Education Reform\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Punjab Education\n            Reform Adjustment

Phase II of PESRP is being prepared by the\n            Punjab Government, and the Bank has been requested to\n            support it through a new series of annual DPCs. Key pillars\n            of the PESRP are: (A) public finance reforms to increase\n            public spending for education (and other pro-poor services)\n            and to ensure fiscal sustainability; (B) reforms that\n            strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment\n            and governance; and (C) education sector reforms to improve\n            quality, access, and sector governance.
