This conclusion is driven\n            primarily by the failure of the regulatory reform program\n            designed to create a competitive real estate and business\n            environment. Nonetheless, sustainability of the benefits\n            achieved is assessed as likely, that is, the Territorial\n            Information and Analytical System (TIAS) is being maintained\n            and upgraded from budgetary funds, and is utilized by both\n            foreign and domestic investors. On the basis of\n            unsatisfactory Quality at Entry, Bank performance is\n            assessed as overall unsatisfactory. On the basis of\n            unsatisfactory implementation performance, overall Borrower\n            performance is assessed as unsatisfactory. Lessons learned\n            comprise the following: 1) Project objectives placed\n            considerable emphasis on policy and regulatory reform, but\n            because this was an investment project, the design did not\n            sufficiently support the achievement of this reform. 2) The\n            way the technical assistance was contractd impeded the\n            ability of both the Bank and the Borrower to learn from the\n            pilot project; contract terms and conditions were not\n            flexible enough to allow for changes in the\n            consultant's scope of work so as to reflect the\n            evolving nature of the follow-on project. 3) An assessment\n            of the reform climate must include the local legislature:\n            the Bank team dealt principally with the executive branch of\n            the City Government, and could have benefited from greater\n            contact with the Legislative Assembly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation -

The project\n            will consist of two components.  The technical cooperation\n            component will have two subcomponents: a) planning,\n            administration, and engineering; and b) institution building\n            and regulatory reform.
