Some lessons learned included: the experience\n            of PFPSAL provides a number of insights that speak to four\n            distinct issues: (i) the critical role of country\n            leadership; (ii) the importance of bundling knowledge and\n            lending in Banks operations; (iii) the appropriate balance\n            of the Bank's focus on supporting design and\n            implementation of a program; and (iv) the specifics of\n            programs in crisis situations. A High degree of up-front\n            political leadership, ownership of the strategy, and the\n            program by the key ministries in the government, and\n            consensus behind the program were important preconditions\n            for the successful adoption and implementation of reforms\n            especially in the case of public sector reforms. The link\n            between lack of public finance transparency and financial\n            sector vulnerability was key for the success of the program.\n            This underscores the usefulness of designing PFPSAL as a\n            multi-sector program. At the same time, as the experience\n            with the differing pace of implementation of the two\n            components under PFPSAL III shows, separation into different\n            programs may be called for at some point in time. In a\n            much-improved environment waiting for an appropriate timing\n            for the privatization of state banks has probably resulted\n            in greater revenues than anticipated or that will have been\n            achieved in faster sales. The increased interest in the\n            Turkish banking sector was most unexpected only two or three\n            years before partly because at the depth of the crisis it is\n            easy to underestimate the extent of the recovery. Therefore,\n            a broader conclusion could be that, On designing a program\n            in the midst of a crisis, flexibility is particularly\n            important regarding policy measures that may have widely\n            differing outcomes under different states of the economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Third Programmatic Financial and\n            Public Sector Adjustment Loan

development\n            impacts were only modest. The approach of combining\n            financial and public sector reforms into a single operation\n            is well suited to the Turkish context at this stage. The\n            combination provides important synergies, including in terms\n            of ensuring consistency between fiscal adjustment, and the\n            financing requirements of the bank restructuring program,\n            and in demonstrating to investors that Turkey is tackling\n            the core structural weaknesses underlying the country's\n            chronic macroeconomic instability. However, urgency and\n            complexity of the financial and public sector\n            reforms-juxtaposed with real world constraints on the\n            institutional capacity of the Turkish administration-argues\n            for selectivity in determining core conditions, and\n            flexibility with regards to the timetable for the\n            implementation of specific reform measures. In order to\n            tackle the complex policy, and institutional reforms that\n            Turkey is undertaking, the programmatic design of these\n            Programmatic Financial project operations, recognizes the\n            need to sequence measures over time, while taking into\n            account the uncertainties inherent in the crisis conditions\n            that Turkey has faced since early 2001. The programmatic\n            design allows for a reasonable degree of adaptability to\n            unfolding events on the ground, while maintaining overall\n            coherence, and direction of the reforms. Another lesson\n            suggests that unless a realistic assessment of the\n            institutional capacity constraints of counterpart agencies\n            is factored into the program, the program will be vulnerable\n            to constraints, likely to be a serious obstacle to program\n            implementation. These capacity constraints can be\n            alleviated, in part, through timely provision of well\n            focused technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Programmatic Financial and

aims at supporting\n            the Government's multi-year financial, and public\n            sector reform program. While it is proposed that the PFPSAL\n            project, will be followed by a second operation, key project\n            priorities include, in the financial sector: an overhaul of\n            the regulatory framework for banking activity; the\n            institutional development of the new Bank Regulation and\n            Supervision Agency; resolution of bank problems, and\n            failures; and, state bank restructuring, and privatization.\n            In the public sector, priorities call for: structural fiscal\n            policies; public expenditure management; financial\n            accountability, and public liability management; and, public\n            sector governance. The PFPSAL will provide budgetary support\n            to help finance the costs, arising from the crisis, and\n            continue to fund the critical social programs. Although the\n            project will restore confidence in the banking system, and\n            in the Government's ability to sustain fiscal\n            adjustments, numerous risks include, a potential loss of\n            political consensus, and institutional weaknesses,\n            aggravated by the macroeconomic risk, that interest rates\n            will remain higher than estimated, which would affect the\n            sustainability of the public debt, renewing instability.\n            But, tight fiscal discipline, and investor confidence in\n            Turkish sovereign debt
