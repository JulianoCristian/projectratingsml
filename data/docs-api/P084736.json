Some lessons\n            learned included: lack of proper knowledge of bidding\n            documents among the domestic bidders restricted their\n            ability to submit the bids in proper format and with\n            requisite information/documents. In light of this\n            shortcoming, it is necessary to improve their knowledge of\n            bidding documents. Motivation to build capacity becomes\n            limited when consultants are performing functions in the\n            absence of civil servants. Consulting firms offer limited\n            career path to local staff, which exacerbates this problem.\n            Permanent cadre of personnel in the line ministries is\n            essential, as lack of continuity of personnel adversely\n            affects retention of knowledge. Any decision on legal\n            framework should be taken after consultation with all major\n            stakeholders as the Procurement Law, 2008 was enacted in\n            July 2008 without consulting major donor and that resulted\n            in to delays and amendments to the Law. Audit and financial\n            management powers rely on strong integrated legislative\n            bases to work well. The PACBP included plans for better\n            legislation but did not control the legal drafting\n            development processes. Legislation developments were\n            assisted by consultative processes that included all\n            relevant players. Related legislation such as finance and\n            audit could best be pushed through together if possible. To\n            overcome the institutional rivalries and resistances,\n            development partner mediation and support should be heavily\n            emphasized and institutional rigidities dealt with as best\n            as possible within the practicalities of the other factors\n            at play."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Public Administration Capacity\n            Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Public\n            Administration Capacity Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/11/11528857/afghanistan-public-administration-capacity-building-project","projn":"AF-Public Admin Cpacity Building Project -- P084736","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Early Child and Children's Health,Public Sector Economics,Community Development and Empowerment,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Management and Reform","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Public Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Social Development","count":"Afghanistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20091218005036"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Law and justice","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Public Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Social Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability systems, Accounting, audited\n            financial statements, benchmarks, Budget Execution, Capacity\n            Building, development assistance, Development Policy,\n            development strategy, financial management, financial\n            regulations, fiscal management, institutional capacity,\n            institutional framework, institutional performance,\n            Management Operations, procurement, Public, Public\n            Administration, Public Administration Project, public\n            administration reform, public expenditures, public finance,\n            public finance management, public financial management,\n            public sector, public sector pay, regulatory framework,\n            savings, structural reform, technical assistance,\n            Transparency, treasury"}},"owner":"Financial Management Unit (SARFM)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance","repnb":"ICR1325"},"7394585":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/12/7394585/afghanistan-public-administration-capacity-building-proposed-project-restructuring-amendment-credit-agreements","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/12/7394585/afghanistan-public-administration-capacity-building-proposed-project-restructuring-amendment-credit-agreements","new_url":"2006/12/7394585/afghanistan-public-administration-capacity-building-proposed-project-restructuring-amendment-credit-agreements","disclosure_date":"2007-05-14T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/02/15/000310607_20070215122702/Rendered/INDEX/38655core.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/02/15/000310607_20070215122702/Rendered/PDF/38655core.pdf","credit_no":"H144","datestored":"2007-02-15T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2006-12-06T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Public Administration\n            Capacity Building : Proposed Project Restructuring and\n            Amendment to the Credit Agreements"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Afghanistan Public Administration\n            Capacity Building Project aims to enhance the performance of\n            public sector procurement, financial management, and\n            accountability systems which will contribute to a more\n            effective, transparent, and accountable state.
