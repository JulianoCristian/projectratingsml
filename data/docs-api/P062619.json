Lessons reinforce the importance\n            of project ownership, and of continuity within the\n            implementation team, and further suggest the following.\n            Promoting a culture of strategic planning for project\n            management is essential, as is the need for better defined\n            mechanisms for project monitoring and control. It is thus\n            suggested that instruments for control of project activities\n            be designed well before implementation begins, to be then\n            fine-tuned during the period of execution, particularly for\n            information technology (IT) systems. Other lessons reinforce\n            the need to maintain flexibility, and also recommend\n            maintaining contact with middle income countries, given, as\n            in this case, Social Security system reforms in Brazil were\n            the culmination of many years of economic and sector work\n            (ESW) and policy dialogue; as such, this association played\n            a valuable role, providing the Bank a deeper knowledge in\n            this process"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
