Some lessons learned\n            included: capacity constraints make it imperative to run\n            complementary technical assistance (TA) projects alongside\n            budget support operations. In the Private Sector Development\n            (PSD) area, for instance, technical support to implement the\n            risk management strategy was critical given that the concept\n            of risk management was new. Beyond technical capacity,\n            support to institutional capacity turned out to be critical\n            as well. Slow progress in some areas such as the protection\n            of indigenous people's land rights can be partly\n            accounted for by the gaps in inter-ministerial coordination\n            mechanisms. The PRGO dialogue in Technical Working\n            Group's (TWGs) and other fora proved a good opportunity\n            to make progress in some of these areas. Despite the\n            selectivity of reform areas to be supported when the PRGO\n            series were being designed, the scope may in the end have\n            still been too broad for a first budget support operation in\n            Cambodia. The Merit-Based Performance Incentive (MBPI)\n            scheme, for example, could have been left out and the civil\n            service reform pursued through other channels. Other areas\n            where vested interests were likely to be strong and/or were\n            process-intensive might also have been put on a less\n            ambitious schedule. While the quality of monitoring is good\n            in the Public Financial Management (PFM) area, the other\n            sectors have not reached the same level. Monitoring remains\n            weak in general, and is in particular not integrated across\n            the various sub-themes of each sector. The situation is\n            improving as various sectors develop Sector-Wide Approaches\n            (as in PFM). A budget-support instrument could be used even\n            more strategically as a catalyst for faster improvement in\n            reform monitoring. This would also require a further\n            investment in monitoring higher-level outcomes. This will\n            mitigate the risk that a narrative of progress emerges from\n            reform monitoring while the broader trajectory is more\n            ambiguous, for instance reflecting that reforms focus on the\n            legal and regulatory framework, with implementation lagging behind."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - First Poverty Reduction and\n            Growth Operation
