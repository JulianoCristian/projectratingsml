Some lessons learned includes: sector\n            development policy lending for the agriculture sector has\n            proven to be an effective, flexible instrument that\n            empowered the Government of Ghana to implement a\n            country-owned policy and the related programs. An important\n            lesson for future operations is to ensure that the policy\n            agenda underlying the operation is complementary to the\n            Bank's and other development partners' investment\n            lending operations, thus creating synergies that enhance the\n            policy making process as well as program implementation. The\n            design of Agriculture Development Policy Operation (AgDPO)\n            policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are major\n            undertakings that need to be better integrated in Ministry\n            of Food and Agriculture's (MoFA's) planning\n            process.

This\n            operation backs the Bank's strategy of supporting\n            Ghana's Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS\n            II), which seeks to modernize agriculture through policy and\n            institutional reforms that deliver the following: (i) the\n            gaps between observed and achievable yields are narrowed,\n            particularly for food crops; (ii) post-harvest losses are\n            reduced; (iii) the irrigated area is increased and informal\n            schemes are better managed; (iv) farmer organizations are\n            empowered to better represent economic interests of their\n            members; (v) the management of Ghana's fisheries is\n            improved; and (vi) budgetary resources for agriculture are\n            well allocated and executed.
