Some lessons\n            learned included:  the mid-term review carried out in\n            January 2003 identified substantial savings under the Loan\n            to the Municipality of Budapest. The Bank agreed to the use\n            the savings for additional project-related investments,\n            including the upgrade of the North Budapest Wastewater\n            Treatment Plant (WWTP). However, the feasibility studies,\n            designs and procurement processes for these new investments\n            were time consuming requiring extension of the project\n            closing date in order to complete implementation. Bank\n            approval for the use of savings towards new investments\n            within a project under implementation should not only cover\n            the technical and other Bank eligibility criteria but also\n            include a comprehensive assessment of the implementation\n            period from design to commissioning for the investments. The\n            contract for the tertiary treatment upgrade of the North\n            Budapest WWTP included the schedule of payments to the\n            contractor. This contract was submitted to the Bank for\n            review and no-objection to the award of the contract was\n            given. However, just prior to the project closing, the last\n            withdrawal application for payment to the contractor was\n            rejected on the basis that the works were not executed and\n            the goods not delivered prior to the project closing date.\n            It is therefore imperative that during the contract approval\n            processes, procurement and disbursement aspects are properly\n            coordinated to prevent similar recurrences."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary -

Notwithstanding this amendment to the loan\n            agreement is intended to allow the use of project cost\n            savings, and of unallocated funds under the Loan, to finance\n            the development of nutrient removal facilities at the North\n            Budapest wastewater treatment plant. The proposed activity\n            is fully consistent with the Project Development Objective\n            of the Loan, which therefore remains unchanged. During the\n            successful implementation of the original components, cost\n            savings of EUR 3.3 million, or 12 percent of the total Loan\n            amount, were realized because competition resulted in lower\n            unit prices than estimated at appraisal. Efficient\n            procurement management and contract supervision by the\n            Project unit of the Municipality of Budapest contributed to\n            these positive results. The cost savings are not the result\n            of contract cancellation. In addition to these savings, the\n            unallocated funds (EUR 2.6 million or 9.4 percent of the\n            total Loan amount) were not used. To this end, and given\n            satisfaction that the proposed amendment complies with the\n            Articles of Agreement of the Bank, it is recommended the\n            Loan Agreement be amended accordingly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary -

This project comprises a component for the\n            Municipality of Budapest and one for the Municipality of\n            Dunaujvaros. The first-named component expands and upgrades\n            two wastewater treatment plants and constructs a trunk main\n            system in an unsewered area of Budapest. One of the\n            wastewater treatment plants upgrades will include added\n            nitrogen and phosphorous removal and biogas recovery. Upon\n            project completion it will meet European Union effluent\n            standards for sensitive waters. The technical assistance\n            provided will carry out a study of industrial tariffs, solve\n            an odor problem, and prepare a study on the regulation of\n            industrial wastes and the enforcement of standards. The\n            second component comprises a new primary and secondary WWTP\n            with sludge stabilization and biogas recovery designed to\n            meet EU standards. Stormwater overflow facilities in the\n            collection system and pumping station upgrading.
