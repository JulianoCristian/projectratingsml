Lesson One: Closely project objectives to\n            country aspirations during project preparation and to the\n            capacity of the government and agency to implement them.\n            Lesson Two: Increase the chances of a satisfactory outcome\n            and of sustainable benefits by having a sustained\n            relationship with a city. The continuous and widespread\n            support of the rebuilding of the city of Mostar built trust\n            in the Bank as a development partner and fostered acceptance\n            of Bank advice and assistance. Lesson Three: Small borrowers\n            pay a relatively large cost to comply with the Bank's\n            fiduciary requirements for Financial Management Systems\n            (FMS). Costs mandated under the Bank's fiduciary FMS\n            requirements should be related to the economic capacity of\n            the Borrower, the size of the project and the value gained.\n            Despite improvements in the Bank's FMS requirements\n            since project preparation, they continue to be both costly\n            and unrelated to client value. Lesson Four: The Project\n            showed the virtues of limiting the externally contracted\n            consultancy to that which the Mostar Water and Sewerage\n            Utility was not able to create with its own staff. The\n            decision to create financial and technical project\n            implementation capacity within the utility itself, with its\n            own staff that stayed on past the project's end, was\n            vindicated by economy and institution building. Lesson Five:\n            The Project demonstrates that a public sector operator can\n            improve service quality and operational efficiency without\n            the help of private sector operators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia-Herzegovina -

Supply, and Sanitation Project, the\n            environmental assessment explores potential adverse effects\n            on the environment. Although sewage collection systems are\n            in place, waste water treatment is rare, and, industrial,\n            and waste water effluents discharge - untreated - into the\n            area's rivers. Furthermore, Mostar's surrounding\n            areas, have no sewers, but latrines, rarely with any septic\n            tanks. This poses serious bio-diversity threats, due to the\n            potential effluent toxicity, and on the population's\n            health, since the risks of insufficient quantity, and/or\n            quality of drinking water, are high. Measures to mitigate\n            adversity suggest, primarily, that adequate institutional\n            arrangements enforce monitoring of microbiological, and\n            physico-chemical testing, to control health, and sanitary\n            risks. Inspection of industrial, and domestic effluent\n            controls should be conducted to prevent ecological\n            degradation. During construction, it is recommended to\n            phase-out water supply systems, and, although solid waste\n            management is not part of this report - in light of the high\n            costs of waste water treatment plants -, the use of adequate\n            septic tanks is recommended."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Mostar Water Supply\n            and Sanitation
