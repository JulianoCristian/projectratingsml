Some\n            lessons learned included: an urban water sector reform to\n            improve sector performance without financing investments is\n            prone to failure. Changes in operational performance,\n            improving commercial and financial efficiency to restore\n            financial equilibrium could not take place without more\n            people getting access to water and the improvement of the\n            service for current customers. Investments financing is\n            critical for any reform package to address production\n            capacity constraints, limited water distribution networks\n            and high technical losses that many water utilities in\n            developing countries are facing to properly deliver their\n            services. The Burkina Faso urban water sector reform was\n            accompanied by an important investment program which\n            resulted in doubling the water production capacity in\n            Ouagadougou and expanding water distribution networks by 30\n            percent. This full implementation of this investment program\n            was essential to the successful reform that took place in\n            Burkina Faso. In that respect, the financial model that was\n            developed at the onset of the project has been a powerful\n            tool to optimize investments and assess required operational\n            efficiency gains consistent with the financial equilibrium\n            of the sector and socially acceptable tariffs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Ouagadougou Water Supply

several fronts, due to the\n            implementation of the Ouagadougou Water Supply Project. The\n            conclusions are global, taking both stages, prior to\n            construction, and, post implementation of the project. The\n            environmental physical and biological concerns, include\n            negative effects on crops, as well as on certain animal\n            species. Nonetheless, these are expected to be temporary\n            impacts, whereas aquaculture will benefit positively.\n            Regarding the socioeconomic front, negative effects are\n            considered, namely, due to resettlement. Public health\n            however, is expected to benefit due to water improvements.\n            The proposed mitigation measures are: 1) adequate water\n            control through simulation models, optimizing water usage,\n            at the same time, diminishing the possibility of flood risks\n            during the reservoir construction; 2) creation of a special\n            fund which will financially contribute to the negative tax\n            liabilities, and/or tariff losses in water consumption; 3)\n            adequate specifications and construction work control,\n            through the installation of alarm devices, thus preventing\n            reservoir breaching risks; and 4) public health awareness,\n            through food aid coordination, particularly to affected\n            families. Further measures are recommended for disease\n            control. A two year period, prior to resettlement, is\n            recommended for rendering new lands for normal production at\n            resettlement time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Assainissement d'Eau\n            Potable a Ouagadougou : etude d'impact sur l'environnement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso -

The\n            conclusions are global, taking both stages, prior to\n            construction, and, post implementation of the project. The\n            environmental physical and biological concerns, include\n            negative effects on crops, as well as on certain animal\n            species. Nonetheless, these are expected to be temporary\n            impacts, whereas aquaculture will benefit positively.\n            Regarding the socioeconomic front, negative effects are\n            considered, namely, due to resettlement. Public health\n            however, is expected to benefit due to water improvements.\n            The proposed mitigation measures are: 1) adequate water\n            control through simulation models, optimizing water usage,\n            at the same time, diminishing the possibility of flood risks\n            during the reservoir construction; 2) creation of a special\n            fund which will financially contribute to the negative tax\n            liabilities, and/or tariff losses in water consumption; 3)\n            adequate specifications and construction work control,\n            through the installation of alarm devices, thus preventing\n            reservoir breaching risks; and 4) public health awareness,\n            through food aid coordination, particularly to affected\n            families.
