Lessons\n            learned were as follows: 1) Implementing a successful\n            environmental services program takes a concerted effort over\n            time with political support and an efficient national\n            institutional arrangement and equally efficient local\n            institutions when the program is decentralized; 2)\n            Significant amounts of international donor funding can serve\n            as an essential (although not, by itself, sufficient)\n            catalyst for inducing important institutional changes\n            leading to more effective and efficient biodiversity\n            conservation programs; 3) Efforts to induce the private\n            sector to enter into voluntary agreements to pay for\n            environmental services may be a useful way of strengthening\n            the private sector's awareness and understanding of the\n            system of payments for ecosystem services, but are unlikely\n            to generate significant amounts of funding to support a\n            national-level Payment for Environmental Services Program\n            (PSA); 4) The Ecomarkets Project's focus on creating\n            new markets for ecosystem services, and on the\n            Project's substantial budget, appear to have\n            facilitated a change in the mindset of key national\n            stakeholders, including officials of the Ministry of Finance\n            and private sector businesses; 5) Evaluating the\n            effectiveness of conservation programs is difficult when\n            such programs are not designed to be tested and measured\n            against a clear baseline or \"control\" case; 6)\n            While a fixed national price might make political and\n            administrative implementation of the program easier, it is\n            not necessarily the most efficient; and 7) Identifying\n            up-front training needs of the implementing agencies staff\n            in order to more effectively implement the project can\n            potentially save precious time and avoid unnecessary delays"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica -

The\n            environmental management plan addresses: 1) forest fire\n            prevention, requiring the establishment of fire breaking\n            clearances; 2) monitoring activity, to be accomplished by\n            forestry inspectors, who should report annually, and\n            recommend best practices; 3) reforestation, to be subjected\n            to physical, and ecological conditions, i.e., types of soil,\n            weather conditions, and, natural drainage.
