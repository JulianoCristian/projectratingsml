Financial Markets Development\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that in view of\n            the long drawn out preparation period, changes in\n            Government, and a subsequent economic/financial crisis, this\n            project would have encountered serious problems in another\n            context, but for the strong commitment of the Government and\n            its high technical capacity, the outcome was successful. The\n            Bank's Financial Sector Review (1993) followed by the\n            Capital Markets Mission (1994-1996) report, funded by the\n            Japanese Grant, provided valuable input during the design of\n            the Project components. Bank efforts to promote the backstop\n            facility added to the delays in project preparation. The\n            design of the Technical Assistance (TA) Project was too\n            complex in terms of the number of beneficiary entities and\n            the number of sub-components. In the case of the TA Project\n            the initial Project matrix contained a very detailed listing\n            of all activities with their respective costs. In the case\n            of this Project, design took over five years, given a two\n            year pause. After the TA Project was re-started, the Bank\n            should have applied a more rigorous test to the adequacy and\n            relevancy of design. The introduction of new financial\n            instruments is a spontaneous creative response on the part\n            of intermediaries to an existing market need. Project\n            appraisal should include sensitivity analysis and\n            contingency planning regarding any unexpected budget\n            shortfall experienced by the borrower and alternative\n            restructuring of project activities. When a beneficiary\n            entity represents a significant share of project financing,\n            staff should carefully evaluate implementation capacity.\n            Complex institution building TA projects require\n            post-closing follow up to check on the sustainability of the\n            initiatives undertaken by the project and to assess the\n            medium- to long-term effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Financial Markets Development\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Financial Markets\n

Specific project objectives are to: (i)\n            develop the financial markets into a more efficient channel\n            for mobilizing domestic savings and financing investment;\n            (ii) improve the institutional capacities for financial\n            sector policy formulation and strengthen the regulatory and\n            supervisory framework in order to, inter alia, minimize the\n            risk of loss of confidence in the financial markets; (iii)\n            contribute to increase the supply of securities, by inter\n            alia facilitating the introduction of new financial\n            instruments; (iv) consolidate the implementation of the\n            social security reform; (v) contribute to deter corrupt or\n            fraudulent practices such as money laundering; and (vi)\n            contribute to more efficient operation of financial and\n            non-financial markets by promoting competition and deterring\n            anti-competitive practices in those markets.  The components\n            of the project are as follows: 1) developing the financial\n            markets into a more efficient intermediation channel; 2)\n            strengthening regulation and supervision capacity in the\n            financial sector; 3) increasing the supply of securities and\n            the availability of other financial instruments; 4)\n            consolidating the implementation of the new social security\n            system; 5) developing a system for control of corrupt and\n            fraudulent practices; 6) developing competition and\n            anti-trust policy capacity; and 7) project management and administration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Financial Markets Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia -
