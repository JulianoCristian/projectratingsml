Likewise,\n            both performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated highly\n            satisfactory, given the Bank's responsiveness, and\n            flexibility to the project's evolution, and, the\n            outstanding government commitment to project implementation,\n            and sustainability. The distinction of the project, being\n            part of a very large scale, and complex program, geared\n            towards educational reform, provides valuable lessons that\n            include significant impact of project interventions on\n            access, and enrolments, on pedagogical reform towards more\n            child centered education, and, on the strengthening of\n            institutional capacity, through establishment of\n            decentralized teacher-support structures. However, concerns\n            include the need for robust, independent monitoring, and\n            evaluation mechanisms, and, further improvements in data\n            quality, and utilization. Moreover, lessons address in\n            particular project planning, and implementation in the\n            social sector. On project planning, these include the\n            autonomy of project management structures, to be closely\n            linked with the state's management structures; school\n            improvements should include a design with relevant\n            educational research; and, lending instruments, such as the\n            Adaptable Program Loan, would allow flexibility, and a more\n            process-based approach. On project implementation, though\n            sound institutional development may have been established,\n            it is nonetheless essential to invest in continued resource\n            support following the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Uttar Pradesh Basic\n            Education
