The project exceeded some of its\n            physical objectives and achieved most of the institutional\n            and financial objectives. GOB first requested the assistance\n            of IDA to finance investment in 1982 of the\n            telecommunications sector. Further to the work of two\n            reconnaissance missions, IDA produced a sector report in\n            1983. The report concluded that the current state of\n            telecommunications is what constituted a major bottleneck to\n            economic development, and that OPTB was ineffective due to\n            manpower, organizational and financial constraints. OPTB was\n            the Borrower and the Government the Guarantor. With respect\n            to the achievement of physical objectives, OPTB performance\n            appears highly satisfactory, particularly considering the\n            lack of previous experience in managing a large development\n            project. Some lessons learned included:  the full\n            realization of the institutional objectives of the project\n            will have required the involvement of the Government\n            authorities in a more active way during project preparation\n            and supervision, particularly in the field of staff statute\n            and Government arrears for telecommunications services; and\n            in-depth sector reorganization and reform of public\n            utilities type sectors traditionally operated in a\n            monopolistic environment, such as posts and telecoms, is a\n            difficult, complex and slow process. The dialogue and\n            consultation process initiated under the project between the\n            interested parties, Government of Benin (GOB) authorities\n            and the donors should be continued, including IDA\n            involvement, to encourage and support further restructuring\n            and determine ways and means to implement the needed changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin
