During\n            project implementation, ensure enabling conditions, pilot\n            and evaluate before taking to scale, staff to build robust\n            institutions, set up an appropriate legal and regulatory\n            framework, build learning systems, ensure ownership at the\n            outset of project implementation, arrange for appropriate\n            dissemination and cross-fertilization, put in place a timely\n            conceived exit strategy, and provide continuity in project\n            management and supervision. At project completion, there is\n            a need to continuously and consistently address pending\n            issues in the education sector. For example, despite project\n            efforts and investments, some inequities worsened throughout\n            the life of the project, mainly due to exogenous factors\n            benefiting private-paid secondary schools (outside the\n            project's interventions) over the municipal and private\n            subsidized ones.
