Ratings for the\n            Rural Energy Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcome\n            was satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization, and Renewables\n            Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in supporting the sector to move towards\n            long-term financial viability and fiscal sustainability, the\n            Bank should lay primary emphasis on broader institutional\n            and policy measures for cost recovery. In contrast, specific\n            target-oriented and time-bound measures in the form of\n            tariff or financial performance covenants carry excessive\n            political implementation risks and are prone to\n            noncompliance by the Borrower. A national push for universal\n            electricity access provision will primarily depend upon the\n            pursuit of a least cost path for grid expansion backed by\n            appropriate sector policies, complemented by off-grid\n            electricity in the interim, or for the long-term as needed.\n            Rapid growth in electrification can be accompanied by\n            sub-optimal use of electricity especially in a situation of\n            relatively low or subsidized tariffs. The Bank should work\n            to develop an understanding with client countries over the\n            role of key institutions before embarking on full-fledged\n            support for them. In a rapidly evolving sector environment,\n            a de facto flexible approach should be adopted to adjust to\n            changing priorities as well as new institutional and\n            on-the-ground developments. The project monitoring and\n            evaluation (M and E) framework should focus on identifying\n            the direct causal links between project interventions and\n            outcomes to the maximum extent possible. This is\n            particularly important, albeit challenging, in large and\n            rapidly evolving sector context in which Bank-supported\n            interventions only partially influence but do not determine\n            overall outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Transmission, Distribution, and\n            Disaster Reconstruction Project; Rural Energy Project; and\n

The adoption of covenants at least as they were\n            formulated in the project legal agreements presents\n            difficulties because of the extreme nature of the remedy\n            that is applied. More nuanced covenants, for example by\n            applying interest rate or grace period penalties for the\n            time that the covenant is breached, may be more effective at\n            sustaining the dialogue while providing a clear incentive\n            for action."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Transmission, Distribution and\n            Disaster Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Transmission,\n            Distribution and Disaster Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/12/9402868/vietnam-transmission-distribution-disaster-reconstruction-project","count":"Vietnam","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, action plan, amount of savings,\n            approach, Assessment of Risk, assistance activities, Audits,\n            availability, balance, Bank Lending, base year, Baseline\n            Cost, baseline costs, Basic, benchmarks, Beneficiaries,\n            Beneficiary, Borrower, budgeting, calculation, capabilities,\n            centralization, checks, Codes, commodities, competition\n            policy, components, consumer, consumer demand, consumers,\n            contingencies, contribution, cost estimates, cost recovery,\n            Creditors, CURRENCY, Debt, Demand for electricity, demand\n            for energy, depreciation, devaluation, Development Agency,\n            Development Assistance, Development Bank, discount rate,\n            Distribution losses, distribution network, distribution\n            networks, distribution system, distribution systems,\n            economic activity, economic analysis, Economic Development,\n            economic rate of return, Efficiency Improvement, efficient\n            lighting, Electricity, electricity consumption, electricity\n            distribution, electricity infrastructure, electricity\n            system, electricity tariffs, Energy Efficiency, Energy\n            Management, engineering, equipment, Exchange Rate, exchange\n            rates, feasibility studies, Financial Analysis, financial\n            benefits, financial crisis, Financial Management, Financial\n            Management Systems, financial performance, financial rate of\n            return, forecasts, foreign direct investment, foreign\n            investment, Gas, GDP, generation, generation capacity, Gross\n            Domestic Product, ID, implementation period, Implementation\n            Plan, Implementing Agencies, implementing agency, interest\n            rate, international consultants, investment decisions,\n            investment management, investment program, IP, Kilowatt\n            hour, lifetime,"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Urban development,Financial and private sector development","projn":"VN-Transmission, Distribution And Disaster\n            -- P045628","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"m,Energy Production and Transportation,Technology Industry,Economic Theory & Research,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","entityids":{"entityid":"000310607_20080501151241"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Power","theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Regulation and competition policy,Other urban development,Other financial and private sector development,Natural disaster management","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Industry,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Vietnam Sustainable Development (EASVS)","trustfund":"TF020484-BNPP-ENERGY : THE NETHERLANDS\n            ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY, ASIA ALTERNATI,TF022228-TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION,\n            & DISASTER RECOVERY-DSM COMPONENT.

Transmission lines will help create a reliable,\n            economical power supply in the South. Construction\n            activities such as cutting trees, clearing routes, digging\n            foundation holes, transporting material, and tensioning\n            conductors can cause soil erosion. Mitigating options\n            include soil replacing, and tree and grass planting. To\n            offset hunting and poaching, fences will be erected and\n            foresty controllers will increase their supervision and\n            inspections. To prevent fire or explosion caused by\n            hazardous spills, construction crews will be supplied\n            protection equipment. To reduce disease risk in construction\n            camps, medical and hygienic measures for handling water and\n            foodstuffs will be firmly adhered to. During the operational\n            phase, the threat of soil erosion around the towers can be\n            alleviated by building a foundation embankment or contouring\n            on sloping land. Trees posing a safety hazard because they\n            are too close to transmission lines will be cut down\n            periodically. A resettlement action plan recommends\n            solutions for compensation, population relocation, and\n            household restoration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Feasibility study-110kv transmission line\n            and substation projects in southern Vietnam"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Transmission and\n            Distribution Development Project : environmental impact\n            analyses and environmental management plans (Vol. 11) :\n            Feasibility study-110kv transmission line and substation\n            projects in southern Vietnam"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/6019327/vietnam-transmission-distribution-development-project-environmental-impact-analyses-environmental-management-plans-vol-11-feasibility-study-110kv-transmission-line-substation-projects-southern-vietnam","projn":"VN-Transmission, Distribution And Disaster\n            -- P045628","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Vietnam","authors":{"authr":"Electricity Joint-Stock Company"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050622134808"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-1","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Cultivation systems; Dangerous substances;\n            Disaster recovery; Distribution network; Electric lines;\n            Embankments; Erosion control; Fencing; Load management;\n            Natural disasters; Occupational diseases; Planting;\n            Resettlement; Soil erosion; Street lighting; Substations;\n            Transmission lines; Urban electrification"},"1":{"cdata!":"Cultivation systems; Dangerous substances;\n            Disaster recovery; Distribution network; Electric lines;\n            Embankments; Erosion control; Fencing; Load management;\n            Natural disasters; Occupational diseases; Planting;\n            Resettlement; Soil erosion; Street lighting; Substations;\n            Transmission lines; Urban electrification"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF050554-TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION,\n            & DISASTER RECOVERY-DSM COMPONENT - US $-DE,TF023485-USDOE-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY ACTIVITIES,TF022865-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY &\n            PROJECT DEV.,TF020484-BNPP-ENERGY : THE NETHERLANDS\n            ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY, ASIA ALTERNATI,TF034756-VIETNAM - TRANSMISSION &\n            DISTRIBUTION PROJECT,TF034731-ASIA REGION - COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT,TF033487-ASIA - HYDROPOWER PROJECT     DY,TF022228-TRANSMISSION, DISTRIBUTION,\n            & DISASTER RECOVERY-DSM COMPONENT.
