These ratings are reflected\n            through the lessons learned, as follows. Nepal's image\n            has suffered tremendously due to the political instability,\n            and ensuing polarization between the key political actors.\n            This image has clearly worsened the investment climate,\n            particularly foreign investment, and has dampened growth\n            prospects. An alleged escalation of human rights abuses, by\n            both sides of the military conflict is also a prime concern\n            for development partners, who feel strongly that the current\n            political/military situation in Nepal is not conducive to\n            Bank support. Notwithstanding, the dialogue between the Bank\n            and the borrower needs to be maintained at all levels during\n            this uncertain period. The Bank can play a constructive role\n            by continuing to support the reform-minded technocrats who\n            spearheaded the Poverty Reduction strategy Paper (PRSP). The\n            costs of not remaining engaged would likely be serious as it\n            would leave reformers isolated, while the momentum for\n            certain reforms would be lost. The distinction between\n            technocrat and politician-driven reforms is important. There\n            remain many important reforms that are relatively\n            non-controversial (e.g. reducing transit costs and improving\n            connectivity) and can be spearheaded by committed\n            technocrats. At the same time, there are other reforms that\n            can have a clear short run political cost such as adjusting\n            petroleum prices. Related to this is the fact that if\n            technocrat-driven reforms are to be sustained, there has to\n            be a concerted effort to limit transfers in key\n            secretary-level positions. Further addressed are lessons on\n            the trade-off between the predictability of budget support\n            and the strength of the annual reform program; on the\n            ability to communicate the rationale behind reforms; that\n            reforms in the judiciary system clearly lag behind reforms\n            on other fronts; and, that major policy shifts in service\n            delivery require a detailed implementation plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - First Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - First Poverty

The\n            PRSC program supports selective key reforms that will\n            directly contribute to pro-poor growth by a) creating fiscal\n            space for, and improving the effectiveness of growth\n            enhancing public investments, and, b) improving the\n            investment climate. The PRSC program also supports\n            Nepal's track record of meaningful reforms in improving\n            service delivery by assisting the government in developing\n            annual benchmarks, consistent with the broad reform\n            objectives, and, by providing the fiscal and technical\n            resources necessary to accelerate the reform momentum. The\n            PRSC process supports the promotion of social inclusion, by\n            improving the effectiveness of targeted programs; improving\n            access to schooling for excluded groups, and, by encouraging\n            civil service diversity. It also supports the\n            government's strategy to improve governance by\n            improving the effectiveness of the civil service,\n            strengthening anti-corruption and accountability\n            institutions, improving the functioning of key agencies,\n            and, improving financial management and procurement\n            practices. The improvements in governance that are supported\n            by the PRSC are designed to bring more accountable,\n            efficient, and a less corrupt government, that will create a\n            more favorable investment climate, and lead to better\n            service delivery. Nonetheless, risks include the potential\n            return to a prolonged period of conflict, that would dampen\n            growth prospects, and the impact of structural reforms on\n            poverty, while the efforts of reform-minded technocrats, may\n            be crowded  by political interference, thus threaten the\n            sustainability of reforms, and in addition, a further\n            worsening of global economic conditions may undermine the\n            impact of growth-enhancing reforms. However, many of the\n            reforms outlined have a wide degree of support across the\n            political spectrum, and from civil society, as they have\n            been based on consensus-building exercises and stakeholder\n            consultations, and, the Bank will provide a loan\n            acceleration clause that would allow the Bank to demand\n            immediate repayment of the proposed loan by the Borrower, in\n            case reforms are reversed, or materially changed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - First Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit
