The\n            project achieved its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been significant, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the sustainability of the financial\n            intermediary operations is a function of several factors.\n            They are: a) financial viability of the credit institutions\n            and their efficient loan administration; b) satisfactory\n            implementation of the supporting TA programs; and c)\n            satisfactory rate of return of the sub-projects. Second, the\n            absence of an effective and proper system for monitoring and\n            recording of the TA programs and lack of coordination\n            between the TA recipients and the government implementing\n            authorities contributed to the poor utilization, lack of\n            sustainability, and low impact of TA in certain areas.\n            Finally, the design and scope of the TA is also critical to\n            achieving project objectives. For TA to be effective, design\n            and objectives should be more specific and targeted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Third Industrial Development
