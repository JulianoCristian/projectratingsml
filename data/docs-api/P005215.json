The\n            success of the project's main component, the Ghom\n            Combined Cycle Power Plant, and dramatic improvements to\n            Tehran Regional Electricity Company's (TREC) financial\n            management can be attributed to a well-designed project\n            implemented by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with a\n            high level of project management capability together with\n            continuity of the PIU staff, continuity of Bank supervision\n            staff, and the spirit of cooperation between the TREC and\n            the Bank. Invariably, shifts in management and staff on both\n            the Borrower and Bank sides result in setbacks. Another\n            contributing factor to the project's success was the\n            use of local expertise to upgrade the Borrower's\n            financial management capability. The software elements of\n            the project received less attention than its physical\n            components. In general, policy and institutional aspects are\n            often put on hold pending endorsement by decision makers at\n            high levels.
