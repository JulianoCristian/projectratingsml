Some lessons learned included:\n            the project involved adopting approaches and technologies\n            which had been practiced relatively infrequently around the\n            world, and of which there were no or few successful\n            experiences in China. These were: polluted/toxic sediment\n            disposal (in Dagu Canal), small town urban sewerage\n            (including the Design-Build-Operate, or DBO method),\n            wastewater reuse, and bus priority corridors. The first two\n            were successfully implemented as originally planned, but at\n            considerable costs. Both required a large amount of\n            high-level input for preparation and implementation, and the\n            DBO for Hangu sewerage incurred a major delay. The\n            wastewater reuse component was cancelled, and the bus\n            priority corridors are still at an experiment and planning\n            stage. They therefore cost the project considerable delay\n            and difficult adjustment efforts.  In fact, it was the\n            programmatic element of the project, city sewer and road\n            component which consisted of small and medium-size\n            subcomponents that allowed an effective adjustment to the\n            cancellations while keeping the project consistent with the\n            original objectives and framework. Adaptable Program Loan\n            (APL) is an instrument that explicitly supports innovations.\n            The experience of this project suggests that a combination\n            of programmatic and specific investment components could be\n            a valid option, while challenge funds or a similar mechanism\n            included in programmatic types of projects could be another."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Tianjin Urban Development and\n            Environment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Tianjin Urban\n            Development

Some of them are included here: The maintenance\n            of machinery and vehicles will be enhanced to ensure that no\n            discharge of black smoke and to strictly comply with the\n            city's regulation for motored vehicles. Secondary dust\n            raised by construction and transport vehicles will be\n            managed by controlling the speed and weight of the vehicles.\n            Other dust control measures include water spraying, cleaning\n            truck wheels at all entrances and exits, and sweeping\n            construction sites. To reduce air pollution, exhaust\n            pollutants will be limited and monitored according to\n            present regulations. Noise levels near schools, hospitals,\n            and residential buildings caused by construction machinery\n            and transport vehicles, are short term and temporary and\n            will be measured; and if not controlled, especially at\n            night, will disturb residents. Noise abatement will include\n            reinforcing windows. Temporary bypass measures and\n            rearranging public transportation bus lines may ease traffic\n            congestion. Discarded soil will be disposed of, cleaned in\n            time, and transported to fixed sites. Replanting vegetation\n            will reduce soil erosion, lessen traffic dust and noise,\n            adjust and improve the road climate, and improve road landscaping."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Baidilu drainage area rehabilitation works :\n            environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Tianjin Urban\n            Development and Environment Project : environmental\n            assessment (Vol. 10) : Baidilu drainage area rehabilitation\n            works : environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/05/14138932/china-second-tianjin-urban-development-environment-project-environmental-assessment-vol-10-baidilu-drainage-area-rehabilitation-works-environmental-management-plan","projn":"CN-Second Tianjin Urban Development And\n            Environment Project -- P040599","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Roads & Highways,Water and Industry,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Tianjin Environmental Impact Assessment Center"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20110503015852"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Sub-national government administration,General transportation sector,Flood protection","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Vehicle emissions;
