There were\n            some delays in project implementation mainly due to delays\n            in equipment procurement and fuel shortages. Shortfalls\n            occurred in targets for production of nonteak hardwood logs\n            and sawnwood, and for construction of all-weather and\n            extended logging season roads. The Timber Corporation, which\n            was the principal implementing agency, was considerably\n            strengthened through the project. The outlook for\n            sustainability appears good, at least over the assumed\n            economic life of the several processing facilities.\n            Throughout the project period, management was of a high\n            professional standard. The performance of contractors and\n            suppliers was adequate. IDA's supervision of the\n            project was also generally satisfactory. The main lessons\n            which emerge from the project are as follows: (i) the\n            economy-wide problem of foreign exchange scarcity, as\n            evidenced by shortages of fuel and building materials, was\n            underestimated at appraisal; (ii) in view of the slow and\n            cumbersome procurement procedures in the country, more lead\n            time should be allowed for procurement activities; (iii) the\n            scope and timeframe for bulding up an export market for\n            nonteak hardwoods have proven to be overoptimistic; and (iv)\n            in the plantation program, the effectiveness of the Taungya\n            silvicultural method, using landless hill people and thus\n            eliminating shifting cultivation and the resulting loss of\n            forest, was established."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burma -

At full development, the net annual\n            incremental forest output is estimated at about 72,000\n            Hoppus (H) tons of teak and 220,000 H tons of hardwood,\n            valued at about US$90 million after processing. The project\n            would generate additional direct employment for about 3,000\n            workers and create new permanent employment for about 1,700\n            landless farm families. The rate of return to the economy is\n            estimated at over 100 percent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burma - Second Forestry (East Pegu Yoma) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burma - Second Forestry (East\n            Pegu Yoma) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/07/726554/burma-second-forestry-east-pegu-yoma-project","projn":"MM-Forestry Ii-267953 -- P003351","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Myanmar","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912450955"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,Agricultural products,agricultural\n            sector,Agriculture,Asian Development\n            Bank,Audits,bagasse,bamboo,bark,Canadian International\n            Development Agency,CIDA,crops,cultivation,debt,decision\n            making,drinking water,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            growth,employment,energy\n            consumption,Expenditures,FAO,farmers,felling,fisheries,Forest,forest\n            areas,Forest Department,Forest Industries,forest\n            industry,forest industry development,forest inventory,forest\n            management,forest products,forest products industry,Forest\n            Resource,Forest Resources,forest roads,forest\n            service,Forestry,forestry activities,Forestry\n            Institutions,forestry operations,Forestry Planning,Forestry\n            Production,Forestry Project,Forestry Projects,FORESTRY\n            SECTOR,Forests,fuelwood,furniture,hardwood,imports,income,innovation,institutional\n            change,irrigation,labor force,land\n            clearing,land-use,livestock,Logging,logging\n            equipment,logs,lumber,manmade forests,mechanical wood\n            products,natural forests,natural regeneration,natural\n            resources,packages,paperboard,Plantations,Planting,plywood,production\n            costs,productivity,pulp,pulp and paper industry,reserve\n            forest,rice,roundwood,Sawmilling,Sawmills,sawnwood,saws,soil\n            erosion,Soils,streams,Teak,Timber,timber extraction,Timber\n            Production,tropical hardwoods,UNDP,United\n            Nations,veneer,veneers,watershed,watershed protection,Wood\n            product,wood using industries,wood-based panels,Working Capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,Agricultural products,agricultural\n            sector,Agriculture,Asian Development\n            Bank,Audits,bagasse,bamboo,bark,Canadian International\n            Development Agency,CIDA,crops,cultivation,debt,decision\n            making,drinking water,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            growth,employment,energy\n            consumption,Expenditures,FAO,farmers,felling,fisheries,Forest,forest\n            areas,Forest Department,Forest Industries,forest\n            industry,forest industry development,forest inventory,forest\n            management,forest products,forest products industry,Forest\n            Resource,Forest Resources,forest roads,forest\n            service,Forestry,forestry activities,Forestry\n            Institutions,forestry operations,Forestry Planning,Forestry\n            Production,Forestry Project,Forestry Projects,FORESTRY\n            SECTOR,Forests,fuelwood,furniture,hardwood,imports,income,innovation,institutional\n            change,irrigation,labor force,land\n            clearing,land-use,livestock,Logging,logging\n            equipment,logs,lumber,manmade forests,mechanical wood\n            products,natural forests,natural regeneration,natural\n            resources,packages,paperboard,Plantations,Planting,plywood,production\n            costs,productivity,pulp,pulp and paper industry,reserve\n            forest,rice,roundwood,Sawmilling,Sawmills,sawnwood,saws,soil\n            erosion,Soils,streams,Teak,Timber,timber extraction,Timber\n            Production,tropical hardwoods,UNDP,United\n            Nations,veneer,veneers,watershed,watershed protection,Wood\n            product,wood using industries,wood-based panels,Working Capital"}},"owner":"SE Asia & Mongolia Country Unit (EACSM)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"2463"},"facets":{}}}
