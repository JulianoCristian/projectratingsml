Some lessons learned included: it is\n            important to maintain sufficient flexibility, particularly\n            in the case of programmatic policy development loans, to\n            adapt and respond to client needs and economic realities in\n            the country. As the external environment was rather negative\n            during the preparation phase, adding a strong sense of\n            urgency to the need to adopt financial sector related\n            reforms, the team worked hard to build sufficient ownership\n            of the many policy and regulatory changes. The conversion of\n            the second DPL to a Policy Based Guarantee (PBG), which\n            significantly leveraged the Bank's lending, was a\n            direct result of the Montenegrin 2012 financing gap, as the\n            prior actions were not significantly different. As well, the\n            regular coordination with other partners combined with\n            providing necessary technical assistance on a timely basis\n            positively impacted outcomes achieved. Cooperation among\n            international agencies (i.e. World Bank Group, IMF, KfW,\n            EBRD) and with the EU, proved essential given that extensive\n            technical assistance was being provided and needed to be\n            coordinated and aligned with the country's priorities\n            and strategic goals. This cooperation was underscored by the\n            central role played by the Government of Montenegro through\n            the Ministry of Finance and CBCG. Further, the reforms in\n            the financial sector in which the Bank had a comparative\n            advantage, were designed in cooperation with the\n            International Monetary Fund, or IMF. The financial sector\n            reforms have been also indirectly aided by investments in\n            undercapitalized banks by the European Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development, or EBRD and the\n            International Finance Corporation, or IFC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Montenegro - First Programmatic Financial\n            Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL)
