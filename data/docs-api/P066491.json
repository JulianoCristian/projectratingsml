In relation\n            to the Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation (WSUR) Project,\n            the audit fully concurs with satisfactory project outcomes,\n            likely sustainability, modest institutional development\n            impacts, and satisfactory performances. Three main lessons\n            address the following: 1) The importance for project\n            flexibility during implementation increases, particularly\n            under difficult situations. The primary focus of these two\n            projects on physical rehabilitation was appropriate, given\n            the government's concern with political reform and\n            civil unrest. It also provided time to nurture on\n            institutional reform agenda and build borrower buy-ins. This\n            subsequently made it possible to help the government cope\n            with ongoing urgent issues resulting from the 1999 crisis\n            caused by the influx of refugees from Kosovo. 2) Sequencing\n            of demanding reform activities and major rehabilitation\n            efforts, as well as the timeframe for their implementation,\n            need to be adequately analyzed to take full account of\n            practical priorities, and the available implementation\n            capacity. 3) The early establishment of a benchmark system\n            is important to facilitate appropriate monitoring of\n            progress and evaluation of impact of activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

Among the lessons learned are the following:\n            (1) Participation of the four utilities and municipalities\n            during the project implementation was key to design and\n            execute the project investments in response to the local\n            needs.  2) The frequent changes of the ministers in Ministry\n            of Territorial Adjustment and Tourism (MOTAT) is becoming a\n            chronic problem with continuous negative impact on\n            maintaining continuity and commitment.  (3) Benchmarking\n            developed as a pilot in this project was an innovative idea\n            implemented for the first time in Albania's water\n            sector, which allowed the local authorities and the project\n            team to measure the project progress and impact on the\n            ground.  (4) Working in good partnership with the government\n            on this investment project has created a positive\n            environment between the Government and the Bank, which\n            helped address institutional issues at the sector and\n            utility level during implementation of the Water Supply\n            Urgent Rehabilitation Project (WSURP) and preparation of the\n            Municipal Water and Wastewater Project (MWWP), such as:\n            transformation of utilities into commercial entities,\n            merging sewerage with water management, increasing water\n            tariffs, and introducing for the first time the sewerage\n            tariffs, which positively affected the increase of the\n            billed revenues of four utilities, and the preparation for\n            the upcoming management contract with a private operator."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

The latter project will\n            introduce private sector participation into Albania's\n            water sector in the form of a management/lease contract. The\n            Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation Project bridges the gap\n            between the present situation and the Municipal Water and\n            Wastewater Project by taking over the private operator in\n            one or two years. The project rehabilitates components of\n            the water supply systems which are prone to failure and/or\n            which are causing extremely high operation costs or health\n            risk due to their state of disrepair. There are twelve\n            project components. The first three build new wells and\n            valve chambers, improve the pumping station and the pressure\n            break tank, and conduct a feasibility study in rural areas\n            of Durres. Components 4 and 5 upgrade well fields and\n            distribution mains for Fier. Components 6 and 7 replace\n            distribution mains, wells, and pumping stations for Lezhe.\n            Component 8 replaces gravity transmission mains and feeder\n            mains to Saranda. Component 9 repairs water leaks for all\n            cities. Component 10 procures consultant services. Component\n            11 provides a consultant to all cities to enhance network\n            analysis and operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Water Supply Urgent Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania -
