The main\n            lessons from this assessment follow. 1) Substantial effort\n            is necessary to integrate economic restructuring reforms\n            with social, and poverty reduction objectives. 2) The Bank\n            needs to ensure that the rationale for reforms (i.e., better\n            provision of energy services to the public) is clear to\n            domestic stakeholders. 3) \"Ownership\" of a\n            project, or an element of a project is key to its success,\n            and it is necessary to ensure that project partners are\n            fully committed to the aims and the approach taken. This\n            occurred for the successful household energy component, but\n            not for the electricity component. 4) A dynamic, supportive,\n            and committed approach by the Bank throughout the lifetime\n            of the project is vital to success, as was the case in the\n            project's household energy component. 5) Regular\n            post-closing project follow-up by Bank operational staff\n            (i.e., while supervising other ongoing projects) may be\n            needed, to ensure projects are meeting their long-term\n            objectives, and to reinforce to project partners the\n            commitment of the Bank to the reform processes in the\n            recipient countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Energy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Energy Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/04/5776768/niger-energy-project","projn":"NE-Energy-115896 -- P001966","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Engineering,Montreal Protocol,Energy and Environment","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Niger","authors":{"authr":"."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050504094918"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission,(Historic)Other power and energy conversion,(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"butane, Co, coal, deforestation, developed\n            countries, drought, economic analysis, economic growth,\n            electric power, electric power Supply, electricity,\n            electricity supply, energy consumption, energy market,\n            energy policy, energy resources, energy sources,\n            engineering, exploitation, financial resources, firewood\n            consumption, flexibility, Forest management, forestry, fuel,\n            fuel substitution, fuels, fuelwood, GNP, heating, Human\n            Development, imports, income, kerosene, lignite, liquefied\n            petroleum gas, Mines, Natural Forests, natural resources,\n            oil, oil exploration, petroleum, petroleum development,\n            petroleum exploration, petroleum gas, petroleum geology,\n            petroleum legislation, petroleum products, petroleum\n            resources, petroleum sector, population growth, power\n            plants, programs, proven reserves, quality standards,\n            renewable energy, renewable energy sources, savings, signs,\n            structures, sustainable use, tax revenue, transport, uranium"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020880-ENERGY PROJECT","repnb":"32149"},"731886":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/06/731886/niger-energy-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/06/731886/niger-energy-project","new_url":"1997/06/731886/niger-energy-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-20T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1997/06/19/000009265_3970909142658/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1997/06/19/000009265_3970909142658/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1880","docdt":"1997-06-19T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1997-06-19T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Niger - Energy Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Energy Project for Niger\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, project\n            sustainability was likely, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: one general\n            lesson is the importance of sustaining a commitment to the\n            implementation of all components and taking sufficient\n            ownership of the project to: address any constraints early\n            on, resolve them to ensure effective project implementation\n            as originally designed, or modify the project if necessary.\n            Concerning the electricity sector, the project showed that\n            despite adequate technical design, satisfactory results\n            cannot be expected from implementing it in a fundamentally\n            defective institutional and financial context. This was\n            recognized in the cancellation of the component and the\n            subsequent resumption of dialogue on sector reform. Hence,\n            before a project begins substantial investment in system\n            expansion, there should be firm commitment, identified\n            mechanisms and some evidence of implementation to resolve\n            major institutional and financial impediments to the\n            satisfactory performance of the project and the sector. The\n            experience with the project's petroleum sector\n            component indicated the encouraging possibility of\n            developing an appropriate division of roles and\n            responsibilities between the public and private sectors, and\n            with a correct enabling environment attracting private\n            sector willingness to absorb fundamental risk. The\n            experience also indicated the importance of insuring that\n            the implementing agencies, including relevant ministries and\n            other supervisory bodies understand both Bank procurement\n            procedures and the basic principles of efficient procurement practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Energy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger -
