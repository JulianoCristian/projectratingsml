The principal achievement of this project is\n            that there are now modern container terminals at the two\n            principal general cargo ports of Chile. Project\n            sustainability in improving port efficiency and inland\n            terminals is likely while progress in improving road\n            accesses is less clear. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performance are considered satisfactory. Key lessons learned\n            include: The original project may have been over-designed\n            and overly optimistic in setting a long and demanding\n            schedule of conditions to be accomplished by the borrower in\n            a short span of time. The project design over-estimated the\n            effect of one relatively small loan on the pace of\n            institutional change within the sector. Where there are two\n            or more ministries directly involved with different aspects\n            of the project, there are special considerations of project\n            ownership and control. A port project can include policy\n            objectives and the preparation of port-related investments,\n            but responsibility for their financing and implementation\n            should be assigned to the agencies concerned. Preparing the\n            training component required better coordination with other\n            training programs. Although the loan was cancelled, the\n            continuance of Bank supervision enabled the directorate of\n            public works to advance its program and benefit the port sub-sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile -
