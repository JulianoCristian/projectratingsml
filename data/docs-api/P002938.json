The main\n            lessons from the CSSDP, and of wide general application\n            suggest that despite commodity prices and natural\n            conditions, at times being unfavorable, a dilapidated\n            agricultural industry can re-emerge relatively quickly\n            through a committed government, and appropriate economic and\n            social policies. Moreover, the financial restructuring of a\n            bankrupt processing industry, which in this case facilitated\n            the return of experienced international operators, proved an\n            essential requirement for agricultural rehabilitation.\n            However, it is underlined that Project designs should be\n            fully complete at approval, especially in\n            production-oriented projects where some components are\n            needed to ensure that output objectives can be achieved.\n            Regarding the Agricultural Research Project, lessons suggest\n            that sustaining smallholder production requires a flow of\n            technology from research, particularly public sector\n            research is especially important in a sector dominated by\n            poor subsistence farmers, dependent on food crops. This is\n            justified on public goods and social safety net grounds, and\n            in terms of financial and economic efficiency, given the\n            high returns to agricultural research for rural areas.\n            Further lessons highlight farm systems approach, and, the\n            complementarity of research and extension."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Cotton subsector Development\n            Project and Agricultural Research and Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Cotton subsector\n            Development Project and Agricultural Research and Trianing\n            Project : Uganda - Cotton subsector Development Project and\n            Agricultural Research and Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6030977/uganda-cotton-subsector-development-project-agricultural-research-trianing-project-uganda-cotton-subsector-development-project-agricultural-research-training-project","projn":"UG-Agric.

Lessons suggest that the\n            changing nature of a research organization, such as national\n            agricultural research systems (NARS), from government\n            entities to semi-autonomous organizations, does not\n            necessarily imply a more dynamic management, nor greater\n            efficiency. Rather, effective research management systems,\n            specifically research planning, and operational procedures,\n            as well as budgeting, financial management, and controls\n            need to be in place, and within the context of a pro-active\n            Bank supervision, and local management, with attention to\n            performance indicators, and monitoring. To exploit genetic\n            potential of existing varieties, research and extension\n            should address farm, and crop management constraints\n            vis-e-vis plant breeding. Likewise, as illustrated by the\n            cassava, and water hyacinth programs, research should be\n            focused on few production issues, whose resolution may lead\n            to rapid, and substantial impacts, instead of diverting over\n            a large number of small activities. Given the under-funded\n            status of many NARS, financial sustainability should not\n            depend on Government, and donor support alone, but fund\n            raising should become a recognized function of research managers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Agricultural Research and Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Agricultural Research\n            and Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/03/1089543/uganda-agricultural-research-training-project","projn":"UG-Agric.

agricultural sector through the\n            development and transfer of improved technology.  It will\n            provide financial assistance to support four broad sets of\n            activities.  First, the project will support the\n            institutional development of the National Agricultural\n            Research System.  It will finance the activities of the\n            National Agricultural Research Organization Board and\n            Secretariat, develop and implement improved administrative,\n            evaluative and priority-setting systems for research\n            programs, and upgrade the capacity of researchers to\n            implement the priority research programs.  Second, the\n            project will support the rehabilitation of research\n            institutes at Serere, Tororo, Jinja and Kifu, and provide\n            the requisite vehicles and research equipment.  Third, it\n            will support the implementation of the high-priority\n            research programs by providing payments for incremental\n            recurrent operating costs, including salaries and allowances\n            under the newly introduced Terms and Conditions of Service\n            for research.  Fourth, the project will support\n            strengthening agricultural education and training\n            capabilities at Makerere University.  Especially, it will\n            support the domestic and foreign based education of degree\n            candidates and staff, the upgrade of facilities and\n            equipment at three faculties and improved curricula for the\n            programs at the Colleges of the Ministry of Agriculture,\n            Animal Industry and Fisheries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Agricultural Research and Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Agricultural Research\n            and Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/11/736784/uganda-agricultural-research-training-project","projn":"UG-Agric.
