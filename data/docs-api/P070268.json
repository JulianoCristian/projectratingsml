Among the lessons\n            learned, it is suggested the Bank's emergency\n            procedures, i.e., Operational Directive 8.50, could be\n            reviewed, to specifically differentiate post conflict\n            situations from natural disaster emergencies, currently\n            inadequately addressed in emergency lending. To this end,\n            lessons further argue on the importance of project design as\n            a balancing act between infrastructure development, and\n            policy formation, for although infrastructure should\n            necessarily take precedence, fostering institutional\n            policies as well, (e.g., education) would define post\n            conflict emergency needs. Overall, social mobilization and\n            communications interventions should be targeted, for\n            example, organizing school rehabilitation committees to\n            participate in classroom rehabilitation could have been the\n            objective, making rural communities the target audience, and\n            selected individual promoters the delivery medium. Other\n            lessons re-enforce the importance of monitoring project\n            performance indicators; of ensuring the distribution of\n            educational materials, possibly pilot testing proposed\n            mechanisms; and, of including educators in the management of\n            education projects, that is, from education policymaking and\n            system management, to even organizational structure and\n            infrastructure development issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor Leste -
