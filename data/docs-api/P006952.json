Soon after\n            the loan was signed in April 1993, the project became\n            enmeshed in the June 1993 to February 1994 presidential\n            campaign. The project required ambitious reforms in\n            restructuring the public sector and drew opposition. The new\n            Government administration which took office in May 1994\n            confirmed its commitment to the broad objectives of the\n            loan, but disagreed with some specific conditions.\n            Meanwhile, general economic conditions deteriorated sharply\n            in 1994. The Bank granted five extensions to the\n            effectiveness conditions. However, Bank decided that the\n            poor macroeconomic framework and the failure of the\n            Government to pass several critical pieces of legislation\n            forced the cancellation of the project. Perhaps the most\n            important lesson learned concerns the importance of\n            ownership of a reform program. This project was eventually\n            terminated because the program had been designed,\n            negotiated, and signed by one administration, but had to be\n            implemented by a new administration with a markedly\n            different approach. A second lesson relates to the nature of\n            conditionality, particularly enactment of laws. If certain\n            laws are absolutely necessary, they are best required as\n            conditions for negotiations or for Board presentation even\n            if this would lead to delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Third Structural Adjustment\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Third Structural\n            Adjustment Loan
