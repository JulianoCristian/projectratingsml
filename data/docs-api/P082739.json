The lessons learned indicate that the\n            Government of Ecuador inherited a precarious macroeconomic\n            situation with a high degree of vulnerability to external\n            shocks and the need to move quickly to establish the bases\n            for sound economic management and stable growth if yet\n            another economic and political crisis was to be avoided. The\n            speed with which a turnaround could be achieved, moreover,\n            was impeded by economic rigidities, weak institutions, and a\n            political system and governance tradition that had long\n            failed to mediate the deep conflicts among its social and\n            economic groups. At the same time, the enactment of laws,\n            the reform of policies, and the restructuring of\n            institutions define the necessary framework for reforms. The\n            implementation and success of reforms depend, however, on\n            the effective application of technical knowledge, skills,\n            and procedures. Resources for technical assistance and\n            training are thus needed in parallel to adjustment lending\n            support to make the latter effective. Efforts to bring\n            public expenditures under control and to rationalize\n            staffing levels and pay scales can have, and be thwarted by,\n            large short-term costs before realizing their potential\n            savings. Finally, the ability of a democratic government to\n            push reforms forward is itself a function of the quality of\n            the public discussion and debate required to build a\n            supportive consensus. The international financial\n            institutions have an important role to play in informing\n            that debate in a country like Ecuador, and this role should\n            be an integral part of the assistance strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Fiscal Consolidation &\n            Competitive Growth Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Fiscal

The main objectives are to\n            bring fiscal sustainability, reinitiate structural reforms\n            to provide a sustained recovery with enhanced\n            competitiveness, and mitigate the impact of adjustment on\n            priority social investment that protects vulnerable groups.\n            This fiscal support will help solve the severe short-term\n            liquidity problem, and create fiscal room for smoothing the\n            social costs of adjustment.  The loan is based on structural\n            reform measures that have been implemented by the Government\n            prior to Board presentation.  The project covers two areas:\n            fiscal consolidation, and faster growth with\n            competitiveness.  Under the first area, the following\n            components are considered: overall fiscal framework, revenue\n            management, public expenditure management, public payroll\n            control, and public debt.  Under the second area, the\n            following components are included: competition and trade\n            policies, pricing and regulatory policies of basic\n            infrastructure services
