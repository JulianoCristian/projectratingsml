The lessons learned indicate that\n            initiatives with objectives targeted at building capacity in\n            the financial and private sectors have a better chance of\n            success if these are conditioned upon sustained government\n            support toward macro-economic stability and development of\n            the business climate, incentive framework, and reliable\n            infrastructure. The success of financial intermediary loans\n            is dependent upon a disciplined credit environment. Business\n            development services are more effective if implementation\n            arrangements are simplified; do not tax an\n            organization's capacity, and do not deter the\n            participation of eligible applicants.
