There were no restructurings or any\n            significant changes to PDO, indicators, or components during\n            the life of this project. Key lessons learned from this\n            project include five overarching ideas. (1) The\n            effectiveness of the CAT DDO as a source of liquidity after\n            an emergency depends on the detailed identification of the\n            procedures and responsibilities of the<BR>Borrower and\n            the Bank to trigger and process the disbursement. (2) The\n            policy dialogue on DRM could be made more efficient by\n            improving the indicators of the policy matrix. (3) Reporting\n            responsibilities and monitoring arrangements should be\n            agreed with the Borrower in the early stages of the\n            operation to improve the effectiveness and monitoring of the\n            policy measures supported by the DPL. (4) Close Bank\n            supervision is also important to support a successful policy\n            dialogue and DRM outcomes. (5) Finally, the Bank should aim\n            to ensure that the Borrower understands the financial\n            aspects of the CAT DDO instrument, and the consequences of\n            the different options available in relation to interest\n            rates, repayment, and renewal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Disaster Risk Management\n            Development Policy
