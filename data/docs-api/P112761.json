Some lessons learned included: the FCDSC holds\n            important lessons for Bank's response to emergencies in\n            Bangladesh. Credits processed in response to emergencies,\n            especially food emergencies have to be processed quickly,\n            must help shape Government's response and contain few\n            if any structural reforms. The experience under the FCDSC\n            also indicates that the informal assistance the Bank can\n            provide in designing the Government's response to a\n            crisis is just as important as the resources provided by the\n            operation. Most of the Bank's assistance in the FCDSC\n            was informal. The Bank must find a way to improve sharing of\n            lessons from emergency response from other countries.\n            Perhaps the experience gained under the Global Food Crisis\n            Response Program (GFRP) framework will help in this regard.\n            Experience with the operation shows that the Bank can be\n            effective in providing emergency assistance even to\n            countries where the overall governance environment is weak.\n            The Bank worked closely with the government to prepare the\n            operation in a timely manner, and continued its close\n            engagement during the implementation period by monitoring\n            funds allocated for safety-net programs and supporting the\n            government's efforts to take remedial action to fix\n            problems with the safety nets through analytical work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
