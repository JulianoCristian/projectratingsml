A\n            fortunate but unforeseen situation was the financing of the\n            third lot of civil works from cost savings which provided an\n            alternative access to the city center of Douala and\n            it's industrial zone from Yaounde. It will be good to\n            anticipate such opportunities in future similar projects in\n            order to use a flexible project design to accommodate cost\n            savings in a more creative manner to enhance achievement of\n            the PDO. At the time of the project implementation, current\n            measures to use savings and keep them within a given\n            International Development Agency (IDA) country envelope had\n            also not been put in place. Institutional development and\n            capacity building are critical factors to ensure\n            sustainability during and after project. Experience suggests\n            that best results are achieved through long-term\n            relationships where new ideas can be introduced indirectly\n            and gradually, in pursuit of a shared vision and with a\n            clear road map. It is also critical to support institutional\n            building by encouraging synergy among implementing agencies\n            while making sure that all initiatives are demand-driven and\n            developed in a participatory manner."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Douala Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Douala Infrastructure

areas, as well as strengthening the capacity of\n            urban road management, and maintenance. The project's\n            three main components will: 1) implement the urban road\n            rehabilitation program in Douala, to cover approximately\n            twenty three km of existing primary roads, connecting the\n            port and industrial areas to other districts of the city,\n            and to the inter-city road network. Pavements will be\n            rebuilt; intersections, sidewalks, and the drainage system\n            will be improved; parking places for buses and taxis, and\n            traffic lights and road signs installed; and, safety\n            improved; 2) provide technical assistance (TA) for program\n            implementation, audits, and monitoring project management,\n            as well as for capacity building to support urban road\n            management, and maintenance. Additionally, TA will be\n            provided for the preparation of an urban development\n            strategy, and program for Douala and other cities, which\n            includes financial, and organizational audits of the Urban\n            Community of Douala; and, 3) support the project unit, and\n            Environment Unit in the Ministry of Pubic Works, for project\n            implementation and monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Douala Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Douala Infrastructure

envisages serious environmental\n            adversity, namely resulting from construction works,\n            aggravating traffic circulation, which is already hampered\n            by frequent flooding, and in turn leads to accelerated\n            roadways degradation, and, includes as well, the risk of\n            soil erosion, in addition to potential disease increases,\n            such as typhoid, and viral hepatitis. Measures to mitigate\n            adversity follow. Traffic signaling, and safety measures\n            will limit circulation, and speed in the proximity of\n            construction areas, while depots, and/or sanitary\n            installations will be located at safe distances from water\n            flows (at least five hundred meters apart). Hydraulic\n            systems along roads construction should prevent the frequent\n            flooding from nearby river flows, and, effluents will be\n            appropriately channeled. Landscaping, and re-vegetation\n            practices would control soil erosion, and air pollution, in\n            addition to slope terracing to contain erosion. Working\n            schedules will be limited to daytime hours, in order to\n            mitigate noise disturbances. Public awareness campaigns will\n            address the public health risks involved, aiming at disease\n            prevention, and control.
