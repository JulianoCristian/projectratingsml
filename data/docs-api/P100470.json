in building its\n            capacity to respond to potential future infections of humans\n            by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and other\n            zoonoses, and preparing for, controlling and responding to\n            influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies\n            in humans. The changes will be undertaken pursuant to a\n            request by the Borrower, received on March 31, 2009, for\n            reallocation and partial cancellation of the loan. Pursuant\n            to this request, the Bank cancelled EUR 7,317,233 of the\n            loan on April 3, 2009, leaving EUR 3.9 million available\n            from the National Sanitary, Veterinary, and Food Safety\n            Authority (ANSVSA), managed activities for reallocation to\n            the human health component as requested by the Borrower. The\n            cancellation has made project restructuring necessary on the\n            occasion of which the requested reallocation can be\n            undertaken. The request by the Borrower was made against the\n            following background: (a) the institution responsible for\n            the implementation of the animal health component has proven\n            unable to effectively manage the implementation of the\n            project in accordance with the provisions of the loan\n            agreement and the project implementation manual, resulting\n            in significant implementation delays that made the\n            achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            unlikely. ANSVSA-managed parts of the project have been\n            under suspension since November 13, 2008, and the requested\n            corrective action required for the Bank to consider the\n            lifting of the suspension was not taken by the set deadline\n            of March 31, 2009; and (b) the Ministry of Public Health\n            (MPH) - responsible for the implementation of part two of\n            the project, has requested additional resources to cover a\n            cost overrun in actual bids and to cover expenditures for\n            additional items, not foreseen at appraisal, which are\n            needed to complete the agreed activities under that component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -

The\n            fertile soil removed should be stored in a special place in\n            order to be used later. Main adverse effects are those\n            characteristic to any construction activity that implies\n            digging works and eventually the use of heavy equipment and\n            transport vehicles: dust from digging process; exhausted gas\n            emission and noise and vibrations from construction\n            equipment and vehicles; disturbance of small wild fauna and\n            vegetation; soil pollution caused by oil and grease leakage\n            and improper solid waste disposal. Due to the small area\n            used as well as to the short time period necessary for\n            construction, the environmental impact is low and temporary.\n            The construction company has full responsibility to take all\n            necessary mitigation measures: strict delimitation of\n            construction area by fence and/or warning belts;\n            sound-absorbent panels around the construction area; use of\n            dust-absorbing screens; compliance with construction work\n            regulations; setting up of waste management system;\n            maintenance of vehicles and construction equipment in\n            special places only. Costs for these measures should be\n            supported by the local administration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Avian Influenza and Human Pandemic\n            Preparedness and Response Project
