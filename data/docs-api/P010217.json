The\n            project achieved its main objective, sustainability is\n            likely, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Two main lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, it is important to structure government\n            policy, with regard to pricing and contractual agreements,\n            to be compatible with the practices of the international\n            industry in order to ensure that the government is\n            successful in attracting private sector participation in the\n            development of the domestic industry. Lastly, in every\n            project, time or schedule delay is important and impacts the\n            economic and financial results of the project, especially\n            with exploration and development programs.
