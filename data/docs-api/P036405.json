Some lessons learned included: the project\n            design should have considered how to achieve the project\n            development objectives in the most effective way based on\n            realistic water demand projection. More careful\n            justification of the investment size should have been\n            undertaken taking into account the water savings from new\n            technologies and more stringent environmental regulations,\n            and possible policy interventions to prevent the serious\n            over-design in capacity from happening. To improve the\n            effectiveness and sustainability of public service delivery,\n            it is clearly desirable to incorporate elements of cost\n            recovery in the pricing of the utility, though this should\n            be phased in gradually. In the institutional set up the\n            provincial water resources bureau (instead of the Wanjiazhai\n            Yellow River Diversion Project Corporation) should have been\n            put in charge of the institutional reforms as per its\n            mandate stipulated in the National Water Law with strong\n            support and coordination from the Provincial. It is legally\n            responsible and best positioned to lead the proposed\n            institutional, policy and pricing reform, which deals with\n            large scale water resources administration, allocation and\n            strategy issues in the province. It is important to ensure\n            that the hard infrastructure aspects remain coordinated and\n            synchronized with the equally important soft aspects of\n            institutional and pricing reform. This should have been\n            addressed right from the beginning of the implementation to\n            achieve maximized project benefits and long-term impact. An\n            opportunity was missed in the early years, which has led to\n            de-linking of the two aspects and less than satisfactory\n            outcome in institutional reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Wanjiazhai Water Transfer\n            Project  : China - Wanjiazhai Water Transfer Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/12/9669269/china-wanjiazhai-water-transfer-project-china-wanjiazhai-water-transfer-project","projn":"CN-Wanjiazhai Water -- P036405","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20080714034447"},"theme":"Land administration and management,Other urban development,Pollution management and environmental health,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sewerage,Sanitation","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to water, aqueducts, Available water,\n            Basin Commission, bifurcation, Central government, China\n            Sea, coastal areas, construction, cost recovery, cost\n            sharing, cubic meters, Culverts, Diversion, domestic use,\n            domestic users, domestic water, domestic water use,\n            engineering, environmental health, environmental laws,\n            environmental management, Environmental Protection,\n            environmental regulations, farmers, gauging, Ground Water,\n            groundwater, groundwater resources, groundwater table,\n            groundwater wells, households, industrial growth, industrial\n            use, Industrial Waste, Industrial Water, Industrial Water\n            Demand, Industrial Water Use, inter basin transfers,\n            investment cost, investment costs, irrigation, local water,\n            managing water resources, municipal water, natural resource\n            management, Natural Resources, Pacific Region, Performance\n            Indicators, Pipeline, PIPELINES, Pollution, Pollution\n            Control, Pressure, provincial government, Provincial Water,\n            provision of water, pumping, pumping rates, Pumping station,\n            pumping stations, quality standards, RESERVOIRS, River\n            Basin, river basin authority, river basins, river water,\n            RIVERS, sale of water, salt water, Sanitation, Sea, service\n            delivery, subsidence, supply of water, surface water,\n            surface water resources, sustainable use, TOWNS, underground\n            water, urban areas, urban centres, urban water, Waste\n            Management, Waste Water, wastewater, water agencies, Water\n            Conservation, water consumption, water delivery system,\n            water demand, water diversion, water extraction, Water Law,\n            Water Management, water marketing, water pollution, Water\n            Pollution Control, water pricing, water quality, Water\n            resource, Water resource management, Water Resources, Water\n            Resources Management, water savings, water sector, water\n            sector development, water shortage, water shortages, water\n            supplies, Water supply, water tariff, water tariffs, WATER\n            TRANSFER, water transmission, water treatment, water\n            treatment facilities, water treatment plant, water use,\n            water utility, wells"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia Sustainable Dev (EASCS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022211-CANADIAN GENERAL CTF II-CHINA,TF029273-PHRD-WANJIAZHAI WATER TRANSFER\n            PROJ.

The\n            present Phase I is limited to supplying water to the Taiyuan\n            Service Area. Negative impacts and their mitigations follow:\n            1) Some potential limited flood hazards caused by pipe,\n            aqueduct, or culvert failures due to earthquakes, poor\n            operations, and poor construction quality will be adequately\n            monitored and controlled. 2) The resettlement plan for those\n            affected by land acquisition includes monetary compensation\n            for lost property, lost income, and moving costs; job\n            training; and new housing. 3) Adequate and safe water supply\n            and sanitation facilities for construction workers, and\n            initial and periodic worker examinations will protect\n            against typhoid and dysentery.
