The project would consist of the\n            following main components: a three-year training program for\n            maintenance staff of the Department of Highways and the\n            National Civil Engineering Equipment Pool; a four-year\n            program for the maintenance of about 16,900 km of roads, and\n            the rehabilitation of about 1,350 km of unpaved roads, by\n            force account; rehabilitation of about 340 km of unpaved\n            roads by domestic contractors with technical assistance;\n            provision of two weighing stations; setting up and staffing\n            of a Road Planning Unit in the Department of Highways; and\n            road preinvestment studies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Fourth Highway
