Some lessons learned included: there is often\n            tension between a short-tem, crisis-driven government action\n            agenda and the longer-term policy horizon for systemic\n            reforms. Consonance with the borrower's strategic\n            priorities facilitates ownership, commitment to reforms, and\n            political acceptance. A stable government and steady\n            parliamentary support help sustain reform momentum. Dialogue\n            with the political opposition ensures that reforms are more\n            sustainable. The country office and continuity in the\n            country team are critical to project design and supervision.\n            Awareness of the political environment can help identify\n            vested interests opposing reforms and devise mitigation\n            measures. The DPL must recognize fiduciary risks related to\n            governance shortcomings in terms of the rule of law, abuse\n            of power, insufficient transparency, minimal accountability,\n

Loan (DPL) Program for Romania is to support the\n            Government's reforms in fiscal management, social\n            protection, and the financial sector. This operation is\n            being proposed as the first of a series of three single\n            tranche programmatic loans totaling Euro 1 billion. The\n            first DPL is for Euro 300, and the second and third DPL will\n            be Euro 360 million and Euro 340 million respectively. The\n            DPL program supports the Government's structural\n            reforms in three key areas: a) improving fiscal\n            sustainability and public financial management\n            (cross-sectoral reforms and reforms in two key\n            sectors-health and education); b) enhancing social\n            protection systems-social assistance and pensions-to address\n            the immediate needs of the poor and vulnerable but also to\n            ensure more effective social protection over the longer\n            term; and c) strengthening the contingency planning and\n            resilience of the financial sector. In the fiscal and\n            financial sector areas, which are also being covered by the\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European\n            Commission (EC) programs, the
