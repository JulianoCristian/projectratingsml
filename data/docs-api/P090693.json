Some lessons learned included: The\n            Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) provided a proven\n            mechanism to support decentralization by delivering\n            financial resources to provincial and district\n            administrations. As a nascent institution, EPF capacity\n            development needs to be prioritized. The EPF lacked\n            visibility and regular communication with higher-level\n            Government of Lao (GoL) staff, potential foreign donors, and\n            the media, partly resulting in its inability to legally\n            secure a sustainable source of financing from GOL revenues.\n            Furthermore, EPF relied unsustainably on World Bank\n            technical support. For the EPF to mature as an institution,\n            it requires enhanced emphasis on technical capacity\n            development, strategic communication planning, and improved\n            fund-raising ability. The presence of voluntary private\n            sector responsibility in Lao PDR can provide substantial\n            financial support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao People's Democratic Republic -\n
