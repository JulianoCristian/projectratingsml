Some lessons learned included:\n            agricultural development plays a pivotal role in poverty\n            reduction in Azerbaijan. Properly operating Irrigation and\n            Drainage (I&D) infrastructure is essential for good\n            agricultural production in the country. Adequate public\n            investments for rehabilitation and modernization of I&D\n            systems are needed to reverse the ongoing deterioration of\n            systems and make them more efficient. Azerbaijan has limited\n            water resources and competing demands for water resources\n            are increasing. Future I&D investments also have to\n            address as one of its main objectives the improvement and\n            sustainable use of water through integrated water resources\n            management from the river basin perspective. Considering the\n            current state of much of the I&D infrastructure in the\n            country, for rehabilitation purposes a system approach has\n            to be adopted, allowing an in-depth analysis of major\n            shortcomings of an entire irrigation or drainage system in\n            order to propose the necessary improvements in light of an\n            overall objective of restoring capacity, increasing\n            efficiency, and improving Operation and Maintenance\n            (O&M). The rehabilitation of I&D infrastructure,\n            institutional reforms in water management, the development\n            of Water Users Associations (WUAs) for ensuring their\n            professional and financial independence, and the transfer to\n            WUAs of the public I&D infrastructure are all necessary\n            instruments for improving in a holistic manner the\n            efficiency and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in Azerbaijan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -
