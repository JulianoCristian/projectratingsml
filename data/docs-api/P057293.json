Some lessons learned\n            included:  deep reforms changing the patterns of governance\n            and public sector management require adequate preparation,\n            including political economy assessment, consensus building\n            effort and wide political and social ownership. In the\n            absence of such thorough preparation, the likelihood of\n            success is low, irrespective of potentially huge long-run\n            gains for the country and society. In the post-conflict\n            environment, a development policy operation (DPO) instrument\n            can be effective if the reform program is well calibrated to\n            a context of weak technical capacity and multiple\n            priorities. In both countries, and for each operation,\n            ownership of reforms was permanently elusive, and was only\n            assured fleetingly by the lure of arrears clearance or debt\n            relief. Ownership of reforms by respective governments\n            followed a pattern of temporary commitment to reforms for\n            immediate returns. Incentives to governments, leadership and\n            ground conditions lacked for a successful pursuit of the\n            ambitious reform agenda in both counties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo,

development\n            impacts are rated as modest. The main lesson highlights the\n            fact that, despite countries affected by conflict, with\n            institutions weakened by years of institutional decline and\n            conflict, the design and implementation of programs, with a\n            visible impact on the human scale is attainable. The bold\n            project approach contributed significantly to the peace\n            process, in that it provided a perspective of renewed\n            cooperation, and return to economic growth, supported by a\n            political leadership, and commitment to the implementation\n            of reforms, the drafting of legislation, and\n            institutionalizing reforms in key areas of governance, and\n            finance. The appropriate identification of the\n            country's specific needs through the Bank's\n            strategy - the transitional support strategy (TSS) -\n            conduced to stabilization, followed by the adjustment\n            program, and, served as an instrument guiding, and ensuring\n            consistency of the project objectives. Upon the\n            authorities' concern on delays regarding the transfer\n            of funds, and, in response to this issue, the Bank agreed -\n            that given the functional problems in the banking system,\n            and, under a follow-up operation to this project - funds\n            would be deposited directly into well-regulated commercial\n            banks, subject to
