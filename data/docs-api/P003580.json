The key lessons\n            learned include: For large investment funds, the managerial,\n            technical, and financial capacity of the administering\n            agency need to be carefully assessed prior to project\n            implementation. The industrial component of the project was\n            designated at a time when much of Chinese industry was under\n            direct government control and authorities were extremely\n            reluctant to strictly enforce pollution discharge standards,\n            let alone to shut down non-complying enterprises. This is no\n            longer the case as the government has moved more toward the\n            position of regulator than operator of industrial\n            enterprises. Institution building as well as policy changes\n            and studies are an inherent and cohesive part of most Bank\n            financed projects. The Borrower needs to monitor the\n            systematic and timely implementation of these activities.\n            Realistic market assessments with the assistance of\n            independent experts should be prepared for new products or\n            expansion of production. Measures of project objectives\n            should be included in the project itself to monitor their\n            progress. Strong initial supervision with staff at earlier\n            stages are vital to maintaining the momentum and motivation\n            of the borrower."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Southern Jiangsu
