The lessons learned indicate that the Subic\n            Bay Meteropolitan Authority (SBMA) needs to have more\n            autonomy and flexibility in order to improve its performance\n            and efficiency. The Bank should have taken timely and\n            appropriate remedial actions when the possible risk of\n            change in SBMA leadership which was already identified\n            during project preparation became a reality. In a project of\n            this type, which encompasses many players, including\n            national government, municipalities, and the SBMA, cohesion\n            and commitment from all players are critical. Future\n            projects should give highest priority to institutional\n            strengthening and capacity building since they are important\n            factors for the successful operation of free ports and\n            economic zones. It is important to ensure at the\n            commencement of the project itself that, there is a\n            competent and experienced project manager working full time,\n            to take care of day to day matters of implementation.\n            Financial management and project systems should be kept\n            simple. Progress should be closely monitored during\n            implementation, and needs should be continually reassessed.\n            It is also necessary to prepare projects efficiently to\n            ensure that time and financial resources are not wasted. In\n            order to minimize delays and avoid mis-procurement, it is\n            important to streamline standard administration procedures\n            for all aspects of project implementation, such as\n            procurement of goods and services, invoicing, processing and\n            payment of project activities. Before implementing the\n            project, it is necessary to anticipate and resolve the\n            problems which could impede smooth implementation. In a\n            multisectoral and multifunctional project, resources for\n            supervision should be allocated based on the country's\n            capacity for using local expertise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
