Algeria. The instruments to be used\n            emphasize asset creation, mainly through natural resource\n            management and environmental protection, with the purpose of\n            increasing labor productivity in a sustainable manner. The\n            project is part of a wider effort to support growth in\n            agriculture, a key sector for the economy, and it\n            complements agricultural reform, in that it seeks to enhance\n            popular support for reform and to alleviate the adverse\n            social effects of adjustment. It will provide a model and\n            laboratory for developing experience in community\n            involvement in rural development in Algeria. The project\n            components are: erosion control, including reforestation and\n            flood control structures; agricultural development\n            comprising land improvement through destoning, windbreaks,\n            and fruit trees and grapevines on sloped land to replace\n            cereal monoculture, and maintaining and opening rural roads\n            (to reduce isolation and to integrate populations into a\n            larger economic area); water resource mobilization through\n            hill ponds, wells and springs; promotion of rural women,\n            especially economically disenfranchised women, using\n            training workshops, family gardens, etc.; increasing the\n            capacity of the decentralized rural organizations acting in\n            place of the implementing agency, and focusing on community\n            participation, technical training and training in project\n            management;
