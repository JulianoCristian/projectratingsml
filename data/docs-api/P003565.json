World Bank performance is rated satisfactory:\n            Despite changes in task managers, supervision was\n            comprehensive in coverage and focused on achieving\n            development objectives. The Bank was responsive to Borrower\n            requests for changes in project components alhtough\n            sometimes the response time was perhaps not as speedy as it\n            should have been. The one failing was in the irregular\n            spacing of supervision missions after the completion of the\n            Inner Ring Road (IRR); this irregularity had an adverse\n            impact on the nature of the traffic management schemes\n            implemented. Borrower performance was similarly rated\n            satisfactory. Some of the many lessons learned that have\n            subsequently been incorporated into preparing Bank urban\n            transport projects in China include: The Bank would probably\n            have had greater impact if it had accepted the municipal\n            government's basic concept of a \"ring and\n            cross\" viaduct network and then worked with the city\n            agencies to produce a more efficient network design and to\n            integrate it with a more effective traffic managmeent\n            strategy. The proposed IRR viaduct was not wide enough and\n            later projects were built with more lanes. On the other\n            hand, the rapid and efficient construction of the smaller\n            road brought some benefits to the city compared to the costs\n            and delays which would have been associated with building a\n            larger facility. However, there were functional design flaws."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shanghai Metropolitan Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shanghai Metropolitan\n
