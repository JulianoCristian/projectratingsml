The\n            closing date for the project be extended from June 30, 2012\n            until December 31, 2012. The extension is necessary to allow\n            additional time for remaining project activities to be\n            completed. One ongoing specific and complex activity, the\n            development of the Integrated Administrative and Control\n            System (IACS) requires 49 weeks starting from the day of\n            signing the Contract with the selected firm. The integration\n            of these systems through the IACS allows the Ministry of\n            Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy (MAFWE) and the\n            Paying Agency to create and implement agricultural policies\n            through subsidies granted to farmers. This system also\n            allows accurate and prompt updating and digitalizing of data\n            on farmers and farms. The Bank team has assessed and\n            discussed progress under this activity during an\n            Implementation Support Mission on September 26-30, 2011. On\n            December 13, 2011, the Government signed the contract with\n            Consortium Abaco, Sinergise and PR Tehnologii Mantova, Italy\n            for the supply and installation of IACS.
