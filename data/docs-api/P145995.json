were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            coordination with other multilaterals enhances the impact of\n            Bank operations. That lesson applies both to preparation as\n            well as to supervision, since each institution has\n            comparative advantages in different areas, all of which are\n            essential for a comprehensive reform program. It is possible\n            to successfully address a crisis situation in a country\n            through a concerted effort of multilateral institutions in\n            support of a committed government. The financing package put\n            together by the IFIs, with Bank\u2019s participation, helped the\n            country overcome the crisis and restore investors\u2019\n            confidence. The fact that Jamaica was able to issue a US$800\n            million sovereign bond in mid-2014 is evidence of this\n            success. Objectives and performance indicators need to be\n            realistic and subject to clear and straightforward\n            monitoring. Indicators need to be easily attributable to\n            government actions and not depend on exogenous factors. If\n            these conditions are not satisfied, tracking progress in\n            achieving the objectives could be difficult."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Economic Stabilization and\n
