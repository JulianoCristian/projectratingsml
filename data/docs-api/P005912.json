Experience with the assessed project\n            confirms a number of OED lessons from the\n            vocational-technical education sub-sector: 1)  The\n            establishment of functional training facilities is necessary\n            but insufficient for producing skilled workers.  Publicly\n            financed vocational training centers are only viable when\n            the government and the private sector establish a joint and\n            effective strategic framework that sets priorities and\n            allocates resources to those priorities.2)  Many vocational\n            training facilities were built when the Bank's strategy\n            was oriented toward that sub-sector. Because o f the expense\n            involved in technological renewal, it may be cheaper to\n            abandon or rebuild some facilities than to rehabilitate\n            them. However, it may be wise for the Bank to reinvest\n            periodically in the renewal o f older facilities in order to\n            extend the life o f earlier investments. 3)  Governments may\n            view vocational training as a means o f helping school\n            dropouts get jobs and alleviate their poverty. However,\n            vocational training centers may select the better-educated\n            students who are ultimately less likely to perform the type\n            o f tasks for which they were trained. Admission criteria\n            might be adapted to suit the needs o f less educated\n            persons, who may have limited training opportunities. 4)  A\n            series o f shorter vocational courses taught in the evenings\n            or weekends may be more suitable to the work schedules o f\n            the poor. 5)  For vocational education projects to succeed,\n            potential trainees and the private sector must be consulted\n            on project components, outcomes, and targets. A dialogue\n            held exclusively with governments risks creating projects\n            for which there is relatively limited demand and commitment.\n            6) The complexities of projects must match implementation\n            capacity. 7)  Management information systems and tracer\n            studies are important tools to monitor the needs of\n            beneficiaries. These activities must be given priority in\n            programming project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen - Vocational Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Yemen - Vocational\n            Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/5877607/republic-yemen-vocational-training-project","projn":"RY-Vocational Training -- P005912","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050621174604"},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"Adult literacy/non-formal education,Vocational training,Central government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accreditation, achievement, achievements,\n            adult education, adult literacy, Basic Education, basic\n            skills, Child Development, complexity, computation,\n            continuing education, Country Assistance Strategies,\n            curricula, Curriculum, diplomas, education projects,\n            education sector, educational infrastructure, educational\n            projects, educational quality, employment, evaluation\n            methods, financial constraints, fine arts, Formal Education,\n            Girls, illiteracy, Institutional Development, instruction,\n            instructional efficiency, instructional materials,\n            instructors, internships, labor market, labor markets,\n            Learning, literacy, literacy centers, literacy rate,\n            literacy training, local communities, Non-Formal Education,\n            Papers, peer review, policy development, policy reform,\n            positive impact, Poverty Reduction, primary school, public\n            agencies, public funding, Quality Assurance, school\n            dropouts, schooling, schools, secondary education, Short\n            courses, Skills Development, skills training, student\n            achievement, student performance, student places, study\n            tours, teacher, teacher knowledge, teacher training,\n            teachers, teaching, Technical Education, Technical Training,\n            textbook production, textbooks, trainees, trainers, training\n            activities, Training Centers, training courses, training\n            facilities, training funds, training institutes, training\n            institutions, training needs, training opportunities,\n            training programs, vocational education, vocational skills,\n            VOCATIONAL TRAINING, vocational training centers"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022559-PHRD-VOCATIONAL TRAINING,TF039719-TUNISIA - SECOND TRG.

A number of\n            lessons are summarized as follows. First addressed, is the\n            need to secure private sector participation amidst major\n            reforms, through specific project activities to engage the\n            private sector in the governance and financing of the\n            sector, which requires technical assistance, and incentives\n            to promote its participation. Furthermore, in the context of\n            weak implementation capacity, sequencing of reforms is\n            paramount, which should be addressed in project design,\n            prioritizing issues as agreed by the Government and\n            stakeholders. This project design should have focused on\n            major labor market needs, in this case, agriculture,\n            commerce, and trade skills. The apparent lack of government\n            commitment weakened project outcomes; instead, ensuring\n            commitment to strengthen financial management, to\n            counterpart funding, and to play a substantial role in\n            ensuring private sector involvement, would have resulted in\n            satisfactory outcomes. This would have fostered relevant\n            cofinancing, efficient vocational training financing, and\n            realistic goals for institutional reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Vocational Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Vocational Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4263512/yemen-vocational-training-project","projn":"RY-Vocational Training -- P005912","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Vocational & Technical Education,Primary Education,ICT Policy and Strategies,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Education","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040615111709"},"subsc":"Adult literacy/non-formal education,Vocational training,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,Adult\n            Education,basic education,community development,community\n            participation,continuing\n            education,contractors,curricula,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,decision-making,economic\n            development,education programs,education\n            projects,educational materials,employment,Exchange\n            Rate,girls,instructional\n            materials,instructors,interventions,knowledge economy,labor\n            market needs,learning,learning achievements,led,modern\n            education,private sector,public sector,secondary\n            schools,skill requirements,Skills Development,skills\n            training,Social Services,Special Needs,study tours,technical\n            assistance,Technical Cooperation,Technical\n            Education,Technical Training,training abroad,training\n            activities,Training Centers,training courses,training\n            investments,training materials,training modules,training\n            needs,training of trainers,training programs,training\n            services,unemployment,vocational skills,Vocational\n            Training,Vocational Training Centers,vocational training programs"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,Adult\n            Education,basic education,community development,community\n            participation,continuing\n            education,contractors,curricula,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,decision-making,economic\n            development,education programs,education\n            projects,educational materials,employment,Exchange\n            Rate,girls,instructional\n            materials,instructors,interventions,knowledge economy,labor\n            market needs,learning,learning achievements,led,modern\n            education,private sector,public sector,secondary\n            schools,skill requirements,Skills Development,skills\n            training,Social Services,Special Needs,study tours,technical\n            assistance,Technical Cooperation,Technical\n            Education,Technical Training,training abroad,training\n            activities,Training Centers,training courses,training\n            investments,training materials,training modules,training\n            needs,training of trainers,training programs,training\n            services,unemployment,vocational skills,Vocational\n            Training,Vocational Training Centers,vocational training programs"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022559-PHRD-VOCATIONAL TRAINING,TF039719-TUNISIA - SECOND TRG.

The components of the project are the\n            following: 1) management and financing of VT, which includes\n            institutional strengthening of the General Authority for\n
