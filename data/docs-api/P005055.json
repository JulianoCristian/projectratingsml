The Vocational\n            Training( Electricity) project was initiated as a response\n            to the Government's decision to address severe\n            shortages of skilled manpower in the electrical power\n            sector, through manpower planning and recruitment of an\n            adequate number of well trained staff. The main objectives\n            of the  project weret o alleviate the shortage of trained\n            manpower in the sector, and to develop a training capability\n            within the Ministry of Electricity and     Energy (MOEE) to\n            upgrade the skills of its engineers, technicians and skilled\n            craftsmen each year. equipped. The successful completion of\n            technical assistance activities was one of the most positive\n            outcomes of the project. The project has had a good impact\n            on training and manpower development. The Bank performed\n            satisfactorily through all the phases of the project. One\n            important lesson learned in this project is the flexibility\n            in project design and Bank agreement to amend the loan to\n            facilitate evolving needs of the sector and the\n            beneficiaries needed to the successful implementation of\n            project objectives. Under its training plan (ongoing through\n            1998), the Egypt Electricity Authority (EEA) wants to\n            establish new centers in the northern parts of Upper Egypt\n            and in the West Delta. Establishment of a Senior Management\n            Training Center for the MOEE is also envisaged as well as\n            development of existing centers to include additional and\n            specialized workshops."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -
