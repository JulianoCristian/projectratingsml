However, the overall borrower\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory, because of lack of\n            Government commitments to private sector development, and of\n            inadequate funding, and lack of leadership during project\n            implementation. Lessons convey that technical assistance\n            projects should not be considered substitutes to weak\n            Government commitment, instead, a shared, and strategic\n            vision among stakeholders, and an active involvement of the\n            private sector should take place during all stages of the\n            project. The institutional framework changes needed to prod\n            private sector development, were hindered by such lack of\n            commitment, rather, emphasis should have been on capacity\n            building as an incremental, and long-term process, that\n            requires motivation for change in recipient institutions.\n            This indicates the need for a close donor coordination,\n            between the Bank and interested donors to support Government\n            programs, essential particularly since Burkina Faso is\n            highly dependent on external assistance. It is further\n            suggested that during implementation, special conditions for\n            credit effectiveness should be avoided, to be made instead a\n            condition of negotiations, if critical to the success of the\n            project; and, during supervision, close attention of Bank\n            management is essential. Nonetheless, the competitiveness\n            study proved instrumental in laying the foundation for a\n            reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Private Sector Assistance
