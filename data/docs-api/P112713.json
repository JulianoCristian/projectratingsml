Some lessons learned\n            included: project institutional arrangements should address\n            coordination and implementation requirements within the\n            implementing institutions to complement arrangements geared\n            to coordination with external partners. Coordination\n            arrangements engaging implementing agencies\u2019 management will\n            help avoid, identify and address instances where key\n            stakeholders are not informed of purpose of reforms, their\n            roles and responsibilities and tackle implementation\n            constraints as they arise. Establishment of a robust\n            management structure within the MoF and other key\n            stakeholders would mitigate the risks of staff turnover by\n            distributing responsibility for implementation across a\n            wider range of staff. The risks posed by frequent changes in\n            the Government\u2019s core team, gaps in project implementation,\n            lack of continuity and ownership, should be made explicit\n            and mitigation measures identified. It is unclear to what\n            extent the Bank to resolve the underlying of the low level\n            of remuneration of Government officials and consultants\n            relative to other market opportunities. However, mitigation\n            strategies might include offering of professional\n            development opportunities to attract staff and succession\n            planning. Flexibility to restructure project activities by\n            responding to emerging opportunities can save a failing\n            project. The adjustment of the project during implementation\n            to incorporate reforms in public procurement, tax\n            administration and revenue forecasting contributed to some\n            of the projects important achievements. This flexibility in\n            implementation was design strength. It allowed the project\n            to respond following the failure of the parallel FMIS\n            project and restored the client and donors\u2019 confidence in\n            the project and its
