The institutional\n            impact is rated as negligible and the sustainability of any\n            achievements is rated as unlikely. The project was approved\n            in June 1988 and became effective in November 1989. The\n            delay to effectiveness was mainly in finalizing the\n            technical assistance contract with the two foreign\n            consulting firms. Soon after effectiveness it became\n            apparent that the 32 pre-identified public sector\n            sub-projects, accounting for about 65 percent of expected\n            sub-loan demand, were no longer qualified for the project.\n            Most of the public sector sub-projects were ineligible\n            because of their poor financial condition. The few that were\n            eligible were unwilling to apply for sub-loans because they\n            felt the credit terms and conditions, especially the market\n            rate of interest, were unattractive. The project was\n            therefore left with the 13 private sector energy\n            conservation investments. However, none of these applied for\n            financing under the project either. The lack of sub-loan\n            demand for energy conservation investments jeopardized the\n            attainment of project objectives. The Bank concurred with\n            the Government's request and cancelled the project on\n            April 7, 1992. No disbursements were made under the credit.\n            No audit is planned. An analysis of the reasons for failure\n            yielded four lessons learned. First, the essential\n            underpinnings of project concept must be exhaustively\n            reviewed. In hindsight, the project design was very poor and\n            not enough background work was done. Second, market demand\n            for funds need to be assessed realistically. Third,\n            effectiveness conditions should be kept simple to avoid\n            delays in fulfillment. Fourth, implementing agencies should\n            be involved during project preparation to create a sense of ownership."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Industrial Energy Efficiency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh -
