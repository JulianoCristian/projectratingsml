Lessons address four main issues: 1)\n            this adjustment operation specifically focused on poverty\n            reducing policies, in contrast to recent adjustment\n            operations in the social sectors, i.e., multi-sector\n            programmatic variety. Due to its nature and poverty focus,\n            and the changes required by the new policies, project\n            results are likely to have beneficial external spill-over,\n            effects on the quality of public services in the social\n            sectors, benefiting groups beyond just the poor. 2) At the\n            Government's request, the instrument selected was the\n            Deferred Draw Down Option (DDO), prepared as such at the\n            early stages of project identification. This presented the\n            advantage that the Bank support was for an already underway\n            reform program, thus with substantial Government commitment\n            ensured, which in turn, did reduce the risks associated with\n            a reform program. 3) The reduced conditionality in a single\n            tranche is a positive feature that reflects in this case,\n            the nature of the DDO instrument, while one other special\n            feature associated with a DDO is that the commitment fee is\n            only applied 60 days after the loan agreement is signed,\n            and, since all conditions are met before Board presentation,\n            there is a strong incentive for fast disbursements, a\n            contributing factor to this operation's success. 4)\n            Finally, it is highlighted that the link with the Technical\n            Assistance Loan will ensure continued Bank involvement,\n            regardless of the DDO's quick disbursements, and will\n            also help support the sustainability of the reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile -
