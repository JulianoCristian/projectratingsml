The findings of the Thematic Overview suggest\n            that the radically changed circumstances in the Indonesian\n            power sector, are conducive to the Bank's continuing\n            reluctance to support new generation projects, which may\n            have to be reconsidered, and alternative ways of structuring\n            mixed public-private generation projects need to be\n            explored. Lessons drawn from the performance assessment of\n            these two projects include: 1) meticulous coal quality\n            monitoring is essential for a plant where minor differences\n            in coal characteristics can have a significant impact on\n            boiler efficiency, with substantial financial consequences;\n            2) a secure long-term supply contract for coal with the\n            optimal characteristics for the Suralaya boilers may justify\n            the payment of a price premium, because of the financial\n            consequences of a poorer heat rate, plant unavailability due\n            to more frequent outages, and increased maintenance costs;\n            3) an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism can only operate\n            satisfactorily under relatively stable macroeconomic\n            conditions: variations in the exchange rate, fuel prices,\n            and inflation, cannot be dealt with, through a technical\n            formula that is de-linked from socio-political\n            considerations; and, 4) project objectives should be\n            directly linked to project components. Furthermore, compared\n            to Specific Investment Loans, an Adaptable Program Loan\n            would appear to be a more appropriate lending instrument for\n            the pursuit of sector reforms that require consensus\n            building, and are particularly suitable instruments in\n            countries where the Bank has a regular sequence of lending\n            operations in the same sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

Despite unfavorable\n            outcomes, the project flexibility demonstrated by the quick\n            responsiveness to the financial crises, as well as the\n            active stakeholder participation during preparation, and\n            implementation, did however contribute to the success of the\n            project's physical components. But lessons drawn from\n            the project are outlined as follows. To avoid discrepancies\n            between the status of project works, and actual\n            disbursements, contractors' invoicing should be\n            streamlined to avoid unnecessary payments delays. Regarding\n            resettlement issues - where indeed the livelihoods of\n            affected populations are at risk - nongovernmental\n            organizations need to maintain strong community relations,\n            through an active role during implementation, enhanced by\n            strong funding capacity to ensure land acquisition, and\n            relocation issues are rightfully implemented. While the\n            centralized project management did effectively correct\n            actions as needed, demonstrating an effective monitoring,\n            and coordination approach, it was however ineffective in\n            directing the required changes. It is suggested that a\n            programmatic approach to lending, i.e., Adaptable Program\n            Lending, in Indonesia's energy sector, is seemingly\n            more suitable to support long-term policy objectives, and\n            institution building, demonstrated by the unsuccessful\n            project outcomes of this operation's traditional\n            approach to investment lending. Finally, the State\n            Electricity Corporation - with a large investment program -\n            was certainly not the company suitable for the use of\n            \"rate of return on revalued assets\" covenant, to\n            measure financial performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Sumatera and\n            Kalimantan Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/12/1675502/indonesia-sumatera-kalimantan-power-project","projn":"ID-Sumatera And Kalimantan Power -- P003910","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Energy Technology & Transmission,ICT Policy and Strategies,Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0201230400500"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Power,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adverse impact,air,air pollution,air\n            pollution control,air quality,ambient\n            standards,audits,bidding,business plans,Business\n            Processes,Coal,coal mining,Coal reserves,Community\n            development,consulting services,consumer\n            surplus,contractors,cost savings,debt,decision making,demand\n            for electricity,economic conditions,effluents,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,electricity\n            demand,emission,emissions,employment,energy\n            conservation,energy conservation measures,energy\n            production,Engineering Services,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impacts,environmental\n            issues,environmental management,environmental\n            policy,environmental protection,environmental\n            requirements,environmentally sensitive areas,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,families,feasibility studies,fish,flue\n            gas,forest management,forestry,fuel,fuel\n            supply,fuels,Gas,Gas Company,government\n            regulations,housing,Hydroelectric\n            Power,income,inflation,legislation,lending\n            operations,Marginal Cost,Mines,Oil,power development,power\n            generation,power plants,power sector,Power\n            Transmission,primary energy,private sector,quality of\n            life,quality standards,regulatory framework,regulatory\n            reform,Rural Electrification,safety,savings,Technical\n            Assistance,Thermal Power,thermal power plants,training\n            programs,upstream sources,watershed,willingness to pay"},"1":{"cdata!":"adverse impact,air,air pollution,air\n            pollution control,air quality,ambient\n            standards,audits,bidding,business plans,Business\n            Processes,Coal,coal mining,Coal reserves,Community\n            development,consulting services,consumer\n            surplus,contractors,cost savings,debt,decision making,demand\n            for electricity,economic conditions,effluents,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,electricity\n            demand,emission,emissions,employment,energy\n            conservation,energy conservation measures,energy\n            production,Engineering Services,Environmental\n            Impact,Environmental Impacts,environmental\n            issues,environmental management,environmental\n            policy,environmental protection,environmental\n            requirements,environmentally sensitive areas,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,families,feasibility studies,fish,flue\n            gas,forest management,forestry,fuel,fuel\n            supply,fuels,Gas,Gas Company,government\n            regulations,housing,Hydroelectric\n            Power,income,inflation,legislation,lending\n            operations,Marginal Cost,Mines,Oil,power development,power\n            generation,power plants,power sector,Power\n            Transmission,primary energy,private sector,quality of\n            life,quality standards,regulatory framework,regulatory\n            reform,Rural Electrification,safety,savings,Technical\n            Assistance,Thermal Power,thermal power plants,training\n            programs,upstream sources,watershed,willingness to pay"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028184-REG.
