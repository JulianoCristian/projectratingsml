The following factors affected\n            project implementation: high turnover of Task Team Leaders,\n            delay in project effectiveness, delay in service level\n            agreements (SLA) effectiveness, insufficient capacity of the\n            Central Project Implementation Unit (CPIU), change of\n            district heat suppliers, budget Code limitation the city of\n            Mytischi in 2004, and suspension of SLAs.  Lessons learned\n            included the following: Continuity of the team working on\n            the project is very important.  Strong local leadership and\n            expertise is essential for the regional development\n            programs. The project design should be realistic and not\n            overly complex. Sub Loan Agreements need to be finalized\n            before the project is presented to the Board.  The Bank\n            should work closely with the implementing agency staff, and\n            encourage them to be more proactive in dealing with delays,\n            especially on procurement issues. It is important that: (i)\n            regular progress reports include indicators explicitly\n            linked to the development objectives of the project; and\n            (ii) the Results
