Some lessons learned included:  before\n            undertaking appraisal of a project as complex as Rio Grande,\n            the Bank should satisfy itself that the project has been\n            adequately prepared. The project design should be reviewed\n            by a panel of experts made up of independent specialists in\n            the main technical disciplines involved, before bid\n            documents are issued. An important lesson is that the\n            success of a project depends more than any other factor on\n            the ability and the experience of the people and the\n            institution involved in its implementation. A case in point\n            is Empresas Publicas Medellin (EPM) was, and still is\n            perhaps the best managed water and power utility in\n            Colombia, despite the rather poor performance of these\n            sectors in general. Last but not least, it is important to\n            emphasize that a complex project will in general face\n            considerable problems during implementation; even in cases\n            where the implementing agency is a very efficient institution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -

The project\n            includes construction of facilities needed by 1990 to\n            provide safe and reliable water supply to about 61,000\n            households currently without water or poorly served, about\n            10,000 commercial establishments, and 8,700 manufacturing\n            and industrial concerns in the Department of Antioquia. The\n            power component of the project would help ensure\n            availability of electricity needed in the department; which\n            is a productive center of major importance to\n            Colombia's economy. Moreover, in line with\n            Colombia's efforts to diminish reliance on\n            non-renewable hydrocarbons, the project would enable\n            reducing costly thermal generation in the national\n            interconnected system. Project works comprise\n            hydro-facilities on the Rio Grande including an earth-fill\n            dam, tunnels, a 300 MW underground power station, a 22 MW\n            surface power station serving as a pressure reducing\n            facility, a balancing tank and a steel conduit to feed raw\n            water to a potable water treatment plant to be constructed\n            under a second phase of this development. The project also\n            includes the extension of a computerized data processing\n            network, and staff training. The main risks are those\n            inherent in major civil works in difficult terrain,\n            including tunneling at great depth. The degree of risk is,\n            however, acceptable because geological conditions in the\n            area have been thoroughly studied, other large civil works\n            have been successfully carried out in the vicinity, Empresas\n            Publicas de Medellin (EPM) staff and consultants have wide\n            experience in this type of work and, finally, adequate\n
