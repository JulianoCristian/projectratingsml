The\n            Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) for the previous\n            World Bank credit line operations in Turkey indicate that\n            some of these operations had to be restructured in\n            mid-stream because the initial project design turned out to\n            be too inflexible. For export credit line projects, earlier\n            World Bank credit line operations in India, Mexico and\n            Colombia have demonstrated the appropriateness of an\n            export-import bank or a foreign trade bank as the focus for\n            the on-lending of World Bank funds (e.g., export-import bank\n            in India, Bancomext in Mexico, Bancoldex in Colombia). These\n            banks are dedicated institutions for developing foreign\n            trade, and do not carry out normal commercial retail operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Export Finance
