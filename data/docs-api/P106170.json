Some lessons learned included:\n            on design the main lesson is that capacity injection schemes\n            like MCP need to be aligned with a wider reform process.\n            Unless they are it is difficult to see how injecting\n            capacity alone in an unreformed ministry will make any\n            difference to performance. The strength of MCP will only be\n            fully realized when it is tied to a wider strategic reform\n            pathway. To this extent capacity injection has to be part\n            and parcel of a whole of ministry reform program, which\n            includes MCP appointees as part of a package of wider\n            ministry support. The second lesson is that capacity\n            injection has to be at scale. Dropping one or two MCPs into\n            a ministry and expecting them to make a difference is\n            fanciful. The real effect and impact will only be achieved\n            by ensuring a 'cluster' approach to MCP placement.\n            In this way a ministry gets the full benefit of the program\n            at scale. The consequence of this is the approach has to be\n            selective and phased. Not all of government can benefit at\n            the same time. The third lesson is that the project\n            development objective (PDO) needs to SMART (Specific,\n            Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound). There is\n            no point having a wonderful and smooth running capacity\n            injection program if at the end of the day you do not know\n            its impact on improving government services. Much more work\n            therefore needs to go into understanding and measuring the\n            linkages between capacity inputs and ministry outputs and\n            this need to be captured adequately in the results framework\n            and identification and articulation of appropriate indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan -
