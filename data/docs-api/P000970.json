This\n            is a project performance assessment report by the\n            Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), to ensure the integrity\n            of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify\n            that the Bank's work is producing the expected results,\n            and to help develop improved directions, policies, and\n            procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from\n            experience. Findings indicate that the project outcome was\n            deemed moderately satisfactory. The relevance of the\n            objectives is rated as substantial, but the relevance of the\n            design was modest. The achievement of the development\n            objectives of attracting export-oriented investment and\n            facilitating trade was substantial. Bank performance is\n            rated moderately unsatisfactory, mainly reflecting the mixed\n            quality at entry and quality of supervision. Borrower\n            performance is rated moderately satisfactory, both for the\n            government and the implementing agencies. The assessment\n            deduced that: 1) 'Free Zones' are more likely to\n            be inefficient where fiscal incentives are nationwide; 2)\n            effective market research and flexible project design are\n            crucial elements for the success of public-private\n            partnership projects; and 3) institutional reforms and trade\n            logistics improvement can play a significant role in\n            facilitating trade."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Trade and Investment Gateway Project (GHATIG)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Trade and Investment\n

Some lessons\n            learned included: private developers for Export Processing\n            Zone (EPZ) do not have to be international. Attracting firms\n            to the EPZ does not have to be led by an international\n            private developer. The international private developer\n            failed to perform and the national developers took over and\n            the EPZ is fully operational. Timely restructuring of a\n            project can lead to a successful implementation of a\n            project. When a project becomes very difficult to implement\n            it's usually a sign that there is a need to revisit the\n            fundamentals of the design and its concepts to enable\n

There are two main components. The\n            first finances feasibility studies of a railway corridor and\n            marshaling yard, and detailed engineering, construction, and\n            supervision of the off-site infrastructure for the Tema\n            export-processing zone, including constructing access roads,\n            side drainage, and associated works; constructs water supply\n            systems, wastewater disposable systems, and off-site\n            drainage systems; supplies and installs electrical power and\n            transformers; builds a container devanning area outside of\n            the port and improves port container and airport cargo\n            facilities; and implements the environmental management\n            plan. The second component promotes investment and removes\n            administrative bottlenecks to facilitate trade. It builds\n            capacity by changing operational procedures, human\n            resources, and international standards compliance in\n            customs, excise, and preventive services; increasing private\n            participation in the ports and harbor authority; converting\n            the civil aviation authority into a regulatory agency and\n            operationalizing open skies; modernizing immigration\n            services regulations and operating procedure; providing\n            country and investment support to the investment promotion\n            center; funding expertise, equipment, training, and\n            operational support to the free zones board;
