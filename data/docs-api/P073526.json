Lessons learned include: the stability\n            existing within the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC)\n            authorities throughout the entire lending and implementation\n            cycles (up to August 15, 2008) created the required\n            conducive environment by limiting shifts in education policy\n            and implementation strategy and of changes in key\n            implementation players. On the other hand, the revision and\n            appropriation of the ongoing project by the new education\n            authorities resulted in a temporary delay of project\n            activities. Ensuring implementation readiness conditions\n            prior to negotiations leads to a more effective and timely\n            physical and financial execution cycle. The delays in\n            physical and financial implementation experienced by this\n            project, especially in the period 2004-2006, could have been\n            mitigated, had the Bank team and management ensured\n            appropriate implementation readiness conditions at the time\n            of appraisal, especially in the case of the acquisition of\n            learning goods, construction of schools and CDEs (State\n            (Department) Education Council - Consejo Departamental de\n            Educacion), the alternative secondary education modality and\n            the in-service teacher training, just to mentioned some\n            examples. The logical chain that links project activities\n            and outputs to the project outcomes should be clear and\n            include all factors that are present in that chain. Even\n            though project outputs which are under the influence/control\n            of the project have been achieved the logical chain may have\n            overlooked other factors that are important to produce the\n            desired project outcomes. Even though outputs have been\n            achieved the desired outcome may not achieved due to\n            incomplete logical chain. Cost-benefit analysis is required\n            during the design of a project to avoid the inclusion of\n            cost ineffective interventions like the prototype schools\n            and have the appropriate technical arguments to debate\n            design options."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Education Reform

Engineering designs should carefully consider\n            adequate sewage treatment, and drainage systems to avoid\n            water pollution, and public health hazards.

There are three project components: 1)\n            improves tools for educational planning and management.\n            Specifically, it improves system management capacity,\n            including planning and management of human resources,\n            information, evaluation, and supervision systems at the\n            central and state levels. This component also finances human\n            resources development, including upgrading teaching and\n            leadership capacity; 2) focuses specifically on secondary\n            schools with an eye to improving management and quality;\n            some of these initiatives will eventually be adopted by\n            primary schools. This component improves educational quality\n            by providing didactic materials, equipment, and training;\n            and assists community-associated management by redesigning\n            the institutional model for planning and management by\n            introducing school development plans (PEIs) and social\n            community projects with parent participation; and 3) funds\n            mechanisms to provide more equitable access to secondary\n            education, namely through scholarship programs for poor\n            students, alternative secondary school programs for rural\n            and working children, and construction of prototype schools\n            in marginal urban areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay -
