Some lessons learned included: a) a\n            clearly-defined and articulated sectoral and institutional\n            policy framework is necessary to provide direction and\n            rationale for project works, sharpen project goals, set\n            priorities, minimize conflicts and avoid ad-hoc and costly\n            non-sustainable initiatives; b) incorporating the active\n            participation of all stakeholders at the earliest stage of a\n            proposed project and continuation of this practice during\n            all subsequent phases is a necessary condition for viable\n            success and to build ownership. Pressure to rush to achieve\n            physical results should be tempered by appropriate advances\n            in the complementary legal, institutional financial and\n            related areas which are necessary to assure sustainability\n            of such works; c) more realism is needed about what can be\n            achieved in terms of institutional development and how. The\n            institutional, administrative financial, legal and related\n            framework should be very clearly-defined understood and\n            agreed-upon by all parties and these should include clear\n            procedures not only for the conceptual phase but also for\n            making them operational; and d) new investments should not\n            be the answer to chronic deferred operation and maintenance\n            deficiencies.
