The project experience offers three\n            lessons: A) When a policy action is stipulated as a loan\n            condition, conditionality needs to be grounded in realistic,\n            dated covenants and supplemented with monitorable\n            performance indicators to ensure implementation. B) Gas\n            pricing ought to extend beyond the goal of achieving\n            financial viability for the gas utility and move toward\n            economic energy pricing based on opportunity cost\n            principles, including an appropriate pricing structure in\n            relation to alternative fuels. C) The Bank needs to exercise\n            flexibility within the procurement guidelines to resolve\n            procurement issues, particularly in countries with weak\n            institutional capacity and where such issues concern\n            components whose implementation is crucial to achieving\n            development objectives and increasing institutional capabilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -

The main\n            lessons concern the leverage that a credit instrument\n            financed by IDA (International Development Association) can\n            reasonably exert on Government policy making in the sector.\n            The investment credit instrument by itself does not provide\n            sufficient influence on Government to take the most\n            difficult restructuring and pricing policy decisions.\n            Conditionalities attached to the IDA adjustment credit, in\n            the Second Structural Adjustment Credit Project (SAC II),\n            were effective in getting the Government to tackle some of\n            the most difficult sector issues, such as that of nonpayment\n            in the gas sector.
