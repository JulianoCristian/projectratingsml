Some lessons learned\n            included: substantial and persisting delays in project\n            implementation due to a difference in approaches in\n            implementation design should be avoided. Such cases should\n            require the application of active and adequate negotiation\n            and resolution between the World Bank and the implementing\n            agency, including senior management, and result in quick\n            action in terms of any changes to the project. In order to\n            enhance adoption of installed connectivity capacity it is\n            useful to envisage actions to stimulate demand so that the\n            effects of improved connectivity reach the local population\n            faster. The project provided both supply, and demand-side\n            interventions, setting an example for other RCIP projects\n            that highlighted this as an area for improvement. The next\n            generation of RCIP projects can further enhance this through\n            supporting the necessary skills and content development to\n            boost uptake and application. The standards for key results\n            indicators for the ICT projects need to be reexamined on a\n            regular basis. Given the rapidly changing nature of ICT,\n            Task Teams and project implementation units need to not only\n            closely monitor the achievement of the result indicators,\n            but periodically check their validity and amend them as\n            necessary to better reflect the reality of the sector at the time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Second Phase of the Regional\n
