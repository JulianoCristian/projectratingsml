- Bosanska Krajina Agriculture\n            and Agroindustries Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project forms a large and integral\n            part of the agricultural development plan of\n            Bosnia-Herzegovina. Situated in one of the least developed\n            yet most promising rural areas in the republic, the project\n            will consist of the following components: (a) primary\n            agricultural production: intensification of production of\n            12,000 individually-owned farms, extension of agricultural\n            production on 9,500 hectares of the social sector land; (b)\n            support services: an extension service, facilities to\n            provide improved livestock and crop breeds and varieties,\n            artificial insemination and machine repair services to\n            individual farmers; and (c) agro-industries component:\n            provision of processing capacity for meat, fruit, vegetables\n            and barley. The project adopts an integrated approach,\n            towards agriculture based on formal cooperation between the\n            individual and social sectors. The individual sector will\n            provide the bulk of the incremental growth of primary\n            production while the social sector is expected to foster the\n            growth of such production through provision of support\n            services to individual farmers and diversify and expand\n            processing facilities to absorb this produce. Incremental\n            production under the project would consist of cereals,\n            fruits, vegetables and livestock products."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Bosanska Krajina Agriculture\n            and Agroindustries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Bosanska Krajina\n            Agriculture and Agroindustries Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/09/726820/yugoslavia-bosanska-krajina-agriculture-agroindustries-project","projn":"Agroind Bosanska-Krajina -- P009181","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912400376"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to credit,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural labor,agricultural\n            land,agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,arable land,Average yields,Bank\n            loans,barley,beans,beef,Breeding,cattle,Cereals,consumers,crop,crop\n            varieties,cropping,crops,cultivated land,development\n            strategy,division of labor,double\n            cropping,drainage,ecological zone,ecological zones,Economic\n            Analysis,Economic Justification,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,equipment,exports,extension,extension\n            services,farm,farm employment,farm employment\n            opportunities,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,feasibility\n            studies,feed,fertilizer,fertilizers,financial\n            resources,flour,food processing,food products,Fruits,growing\n            season,growth potential,growth\n            rate,hay,husbandry,imports,incidence of\n            poverty,income,income levels,incomes,industrial\n            crops,industrialization,insurance,interest\n            rate,Irri,irrigation,labor force,land development,Land\n            resources,livestock,livestock products,"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to credit,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural labor,agricultural\n            land,agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,arable land,Average yields,Bank\n            loans,barley,beans,beef,Breeding,cattle,Cereals,consumers,crop,crop\n            varieties,cropping,crops,cultivated land,development\n            strategy,division of labor,double\n            cropping,drainage,ecological zone,ecological zones,Economic\n            Analysis,Economic Justification,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,equipment,exports,extension,extension\n            services,farm,farm employment,farm employment\n            opportunities,farmer,farmers,farming,farms,feasibility\n            studies,feed,fertilizer,fertilizers,financial\n            resources,flour,food processing,food products,Fruits,growing\n            season,growth potential,growth\n            rate,hay,husbandry,imports,incidence of\n            poverty,income,income levels,incomes,industrial\n            crops,industrialization,insurance,interest\n            rate,Irri,irrigation,labor force,land development,Land\n            resources,livestock,livestock products,"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","repnb":"2065"},"facets":{}}}
