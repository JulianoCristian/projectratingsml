The\n            program aims at quickly restoring macroeconomic balance and\n            confidence in the economy, improving the management of\n            public resources, and strengthening the policy framework for\n            efficient private sector growth, both through measures that\n            could be quickly implemented and by starting a medium term\n            process of public sector reform.  The specific components of\n            Niger's adjustment program supported by the project\n            include:  (1) measures simplifying the tax system,\n            strengthening tax administration, and widening the tax base;\n            (2) reducing the share of the wage bill, and subsidies and\n            transfers in current expenditures favoring the priority\n            areas of primary education, basic health care and road\n            maintenance; and (3) implementing the public enterprises\n            privatization program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Public Sector Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Public Sector Adjustment\n            Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/02/731507/niger-public-sector-adjustment-credit-project","projn":"NE-Public Sector Adj. -- P001974","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,National Governance,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Niger","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970619110928"},"subsc":"Other industry,General transportation sector,Health,Micro- and SME finance,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,adjustment\n            policies,adverse effects,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable\n            land,authorization,autonomy,bad debts,balance of\n            payments,banking system,Banque Centrale des Etats de\n            l'Afrique de l'Ouest,basic education,budgetary\n            allocations,Central Bank,civil service,climatic\n            conditions,Coal,collection\n            services,competitiveness,consolidation,current\n            expenditures,debt,debt relief,debt\n            service,democracy,devaluation,development\n            assistance,Development Projects,economic growth,economic\n            incentives,Economic performance,Economic Recovery,economic\n            reform,electricity,employment,Enterprise\n            Reform,evasion,execution,exports,financial crisis,financial\n            health,financial institutions,financial\n            performance,financial requirements,financial\n            resources,financial sector,financial viability,FISCAL,fiscal\n            deficit,fiscal policy,FISCAL YEAR,foreign assets,foreign\n            assistance,foreign exchange,formal economy,government\n            departments,Government efforts,government\n            expenditures,government revenue,Government\n            services,housing,human development,human\n            resources,imports,Income,Inflation,inflation rate,informal\n            sector,interest rates,inventory,investment capital,labor\n            force,labor unions,Laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,Legislative elections,levies,liquidation,"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,adjustment\n            policies,adverse effects,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable\n            land,authorization,autonomy,bad debts,balance of\n            payments,banking system,Banque Centrale des Etats de\n            l'Afrique de l'Ouest,basic education,budgetary\n            allocations,Central Bank,civil service,climatic\n            conditions,Coal,collection\n            services,competitiveness,consolidation,current\n            expenditures,debt,debt relief,debt\n            service,democracy,devaluation,development\n            assistance,Development Projects,economic growth,economic\n            incentives,Economic performance,Economic Recovery,economic\n            reform,electricity,employment,Enterprise\n            Reform,evasion,execution,exports,financial crisis,financial\n            health,financial institutions,financial\n            performance,financial requirements,financial\n            resources,financial sector,financial viability,FISCAL,fiscal\n            deficit,fiscal policy,FISCAL YEAR,foreign assets,foreign\n            assistance,foreign exchange,formal economy,government\n            departments,Government efforts,government\n            expenditures,government revenue,Government\n            services,housing,human development,human\n            resources,imports,Income,Inflation,inflation rate,informal\n            sector,interest rates,inventory,investment capital,labor\n            force,labor unions,Laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,Legislative elections,levies,liquidation,"}},"owner":"AFT: Macroeconomics 4 (AFTM4)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"P7074"},"facets":{}}}
