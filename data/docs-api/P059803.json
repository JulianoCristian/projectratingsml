Some lessons\n            learned included: beneficiary assessment should be\n            programmed in some form or manner in an environment clean-up\n            project. It can be a valuable tool in understanding the\n            social gains made under the project. In pollution clean-up\n            projects, adaptation to local conditions and inherent\n            uncertainties regarding the extent of pollution is largely a\n            process of learning by doing. When contamination occurs, the\n            involved physicochemical processes tends to be governed by\n            complex, multi-factorial conditions that can lead to\n            extremely irregular pollution distributions and create a\n            high probability for unforeseen situations that are\n            uncovered only during remediation works. The project design\n            should factor in the risks associated with recurrent\n            institutional changes and state approval processes in\n            Kazakhstan leading to delays.

To date, 90\n            percent of the loan or US$ 36 million has been disbursed and\n            more than 1,000,000 m of polluted soil has been safely\n            disposed in the constructed and operational hazardous waste\n            landfill. Works on the Intumak Reservoir Rehabilitation are\n            approximately 50 percent complete. In accordance with the\n            developed action plan and the plan of works by the\n            contractors, the majority of works can be completed by the\n            end of 2010, with the final closure of the landfill in\n            spring 2011 after the flood season. All procurement under\n            the project is finalized. The total costs of the project\n            increased from the original US$ 67.82 million to US$ 97.42\n            million during the detail design phase (financed under the\n            project after the loan effectiveness due to its complexity\n            and costs). Subsequently, the ministry of finance preferred\n            to finance the increase of costs from additional government\n            co-financing rather than an increase of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan - Nura River Clean-up\n            Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/06/12492294/kazakhstan-nura-river-clean-up-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"KZ-Nura River Clean-Up Project -- P059803","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Water and Industry,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Housing & Human Habitats,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","count":"Kazakhstan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100630034021"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Solid waste management,Petrochemicals and fertilizers,Irrigation and drainage,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"CLEAN-UP, disbursements, expenditures, flood\n            management, LOAN, Loan Agreement, local water users,\n            mercury, mercury pollution, procurement, River Basin,\n            safety, water supply"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF022839-GERMAN JPO-MR.
