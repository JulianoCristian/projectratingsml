The assistance rendered by\n            the World Bank since 1996 gave an appreciable impetus to the\n            sector development. One of these financial aids concerned\n            implementation of key economic reforms in the agrarian\n            sector. To provide such aid, a project was developed\n            entitled agriculture sector adjustment loan. Its resources\n            were used to carry out land reform, to restructure\n            agricultural enterprises, to privatize, and de-monopolize\n            agro-industrial enterprises, as well as to liberalize\n            internal and external trade, and to finance the critical\n            import needs. The seeds development project helped improve\n            the situation in the area of seed production and develop its\n            competitiveness. The rural finance project objective was to\n            facilitate the development of effectively operating and\n            competitive rural regions, and to improve the living\n            standards of the rural population. In June 2003, the World\n            Bank approved the decision to extend a loan in the amount of\n            United States (U.S.) 195 million dollars for implementing\n            the rural land titling and cadastre development project for\n            Ukraine. The World Bank supported land reform as a priority\n            component of economic transformations that are taking place\n            in the Ukrainian agrarian sector. The activities envisaged\n            by the project are aimed at a fair distribution of land\n            plots among farmers, consolidating of their ownership rights\n            to land by issuing respective state land titles on a\n            free-of-charge basis, as well as the development of a land\n            lease market, which is to contribute to improving the living\n            standards of the rural population. The project will focus\n            much attention to informing the population on the work\n            carried out and the significance of land reform on the\n            whole. Furthermore, additional funds will be allocated to\n            purchase required equipment for agrarian universities in the\n            cities of Odesa, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects in agriculture"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects in agriculture"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955632/world-bank-projects-agriculture","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural produce, agricultural\n            producers, Agriculture, Bank loan, Cadastre, distribution of\n            land, domestic market, equipment, farmers, financial\n            institutions, financial intermediaries, issuance, land\n            ownership, Land reform, land title, land titles, Land\n            Titling, land-management, landholders, living standards,\n            Loan, long-term capital, mortgage, mortgage finance, movable\n            assets, movable property, Rural, rural areas, rural economy,\n            Rural Finance, rural financing, rural population, rural\n            regions, rural workers, social protection, universities"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Trade and integration,Environment and natural resource management,Economic management,Financial and private sector development,Rule of law","topic":"Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962,Agriculture Technology m1326423 1950,Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170","projn":"UA-Agricultural Seed Development Project -- P009117,UA-Agriculture Secal -- P009113,UA-Rural Land Titling & Cadastre\n            Development Project -- P035777","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Regional Economic Development,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204154643"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Agro-industry,Agricultural extension and research,Housing finance,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","theme":"Export development and competitiveness,Land administration and management,Other economic management,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Legal institutions for a market economy,Personal and property rights,Rural markets,Other rural development,Regulation and competition policy","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962,Agriculture Technology m1326423 1950,Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","F","B"],"trustfund":"TF029341-PHRD - LAND REGISTRATION &\n            AGRI.

Key lesson learned include: 1) It is important\n            to build stable base for reform and anticipate potential\n            changes in leadership. A core group of articulate\n            agricultural policy analysts and working group leaders is\n            key to generating and sustaining momentum in an agricultural\n            reform program and maintaining the Government's level\n            of attention to politically charged agricultural reform\n            issues. 2) It is realistic to recognize the limits of the\n            policy instruments included under the conditionalities. 3)\n            It is key to pay close attention to the time frame and lags\n            of policies. It was unrealistic to believe that the\n            implementation of the sets of conditionalities aimed at farm\n            restructuring and agro-industrial privatization and\n            demonopolization would be able in a year and a half's\n            time to substantially reorient land tenure, alter corporate\n            governance, and cause newly formed enterprises to exhibit\n            independence of their former national and regional\n            supervising monopolies. 4) Considerable attention should be\n            accorded to the political economy of change. An explicit\n            analysis should be made of: a) the receptivity of major\n            political groups to change; b) public education and outreach\n            programs required to reach interested stakeholders; and c)\n            elements of the project design that could appeal to stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan

This will be achieved by\n            instituting agricultural and trade reforms aimed at\n            increasing market competition, encouraging private ownership\n            and investment in land and other productive assets, and\n            providing short term balance-of-payments support for\n            financing critical imports. The reform program that the Ag\n            SECAL support will improve agricultural terms of trade,\n            increase input flows to farms, expand agricultural exports,\n            and increase the efficiency of farm management. The Ag SECAL\n            encompasses policy reforms and balance of-payments\n            financing. The policy conditionally will focus on the\n            agricultural sector and address the following: a) reduction\n            in the export restrictions allowing increased access to\n            export market; b) development of a well functioning land\n            market; and c) enabling privatization and demonopolization\n            of existing agribusiness firms and encouraging new entrants.\n            The negative short-term adjustments associated with these\n            policy changes will be cushioned by balance-of-payments\n            financing. The funds provided under this component of the Ag\n            SECAL will be used to finance general imports. The funds\n            will be channeled through the National Bank of Ukraine, and\n            allocated through the established market system for\n            auctioning foreign exchange. While balance-of-payments\n            support is not expected to be targeted at financing imports\n            for the agricultural sector it is expected to improve the\n            availability of
