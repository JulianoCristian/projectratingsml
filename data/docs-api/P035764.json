The assessment\n            shows the difficulties of implementing projects affected by\n            a major exogenous shock, and a number of lessons can be\n            drawn on how problems were addressed. To summarize, lessons\n            suggest the following: 1) the formulation of realistic and\n            measurable project objectives is crucial, and when there is\n            a major restructuring of a project, the task team should\n            take the opportunity to review the original objectives in\n            light of changed circumstances; 2) Bank supervision\n            arrangements should be realistic, and budgets should be\n            higher when projects are decentralized, or spread over a\n            wide area involving more than one implementing agency.\n            Project design should take this into account; 3) covenants\n            should not be imposed on authorities that do not have the\n            legal power to carry out the commitment. Weak or open-ended\n            conditionality should be avoided, and objectives should not\n            be conflicting; and, 4) it is unwise to involve local,\n            sub-national borrowers with the foreign exchange risks in\n            unstable macroeconomic conditions, especially when their\n            revenues are in the local currency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia - Urban Transport and Bridge\n            Rehabilitation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russia - Urban Transport and\n            Bridge Rehabilitation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/5872732/russia-urban-transport-bridge-rehabilitation-projects","projn":"RU-Urban Transport -- P008806,RU-Bridge Rehabilitation Project -- P035764","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050620101345"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,General transportation sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets, Bank management, Bank Performance,\n            Bank supervision, bankruptcy, BRIDGE, Bridge Management\n            System, BRIDGE REHABILITATION, Bridges, bus, bus industry,\n            Buses, car ownership, Cities, City Administration, city\n            authorities, city planners, commuting, concrete,\n            construction methods, corrosion, cost of capital, cracking,\n            debt, decentralization, employment, fare evasion, fare\n            revenue, fares, final report, financial management, Fiscal\n            Year, foreign exchange, fuel, fuel consumption, Highways,\n            icing, inflation, Institutional Development, interchanges,\n            land use, legislation, macroeconomic conditions, metro\n            systems, mobility, municipal governments, national roads,\n            natural resources, net benefits, operating costs, passenger\n            kilometers, passenger transport, passenger transport\n            operations, Passenger Vehicles, peer review, private\n            operators, public expenditures, public transport market,\n            public transport operations, public transport operators,\n            Public Transport Reform, public transport vehicles,\n            Railways, regulatory reform, revenue sources, road\n            authorities, road sector, road systems, road users, roads,\n            routes, safety, safety grounds, safety standards, service\n            provision, stakeholders, steel, structural elements,\n            structures, subsidiary, Technical assistance, Timber,\n            traffic, traffic congestion, traffic levels, trams,\n            transparency, transport capacity, transport projects,\n            transport sector, trips, trolleybuses, urban passenger,\n            urban passenger transport, urban passenger transport sector,\n            Urban Public Transport, URBAN TRANSPORT, Urban Transport\n            Project, urban transport reform, urban transport sector,\n            urban transport services, urban transport systems, walking,\n            water leakage, waterproofing"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF031911-RUSSIA - TRANSPORT,TF032988-RUSSIA - TRANSPORTATION,TF033067-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY REHABILITATION\n            AND MAINTENANCE PROJECTS,TF033472-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY REHABILITATION\n            & MAINTENANCE PROJECTS,TF033799-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY, BRIDGE REHABILITATION,TF033973-RUSSIA - HIGHWAY REHAB.

Five lessons stand out in the experience with\n            the Bridge Rehabilitation Project (BRP). First, in an\n            untested situation and intrinsically uncertain projects, the\n            use of pilots for the first batch of design and construction\n            contracts was essential to identify the barriers of\n            high-quality and cost-effective investments, thus speeding\n            up all the subsequent batches. Second, a corollary to the\n            first, is that the use of bilateral grant funding for the\n            pilot design studies permitted an early start of these,\n            without waiting for loan effectiveness. In the BRP, this\n            took the sting out of the wait from negotiations and\n            effectiveness. It also helped that ironing out of the early\n            problems with designs. Third, the insistence on getting\n            high-quality designs before tendering the works resulted in\n            a much better cost experience for risk-laden bridge\n            rehabilitation than with a comparatively simpler road\n            rehabilitation works funded under the Russia Highway\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (HRMP). Fourth,\n            passing from an implementation experience with relaxed\n            procurement rules, introduced under critical circumstances,\n            to a more rigorous regime, warranted a major, formal,\n            visible effort of communicating with the Borrower, perhaps a\n            relaunch. Fifth, in a project with geographically dispersed\n            operations such as the BRP, there were crucial trade-offs\n            between centralized and locally-based arrangements for\n            project management. Resolving the tension between high\n            implementation efficiency (especially as concerns the\n            Bank's supervision costs) and longer-term development\n            effectiveness early in the project may have made a\n            significant difference later on as the pendulum dangled\n            between the survival and cancellation of the\n            federal/regional component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - A Bridge Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - A Bridge\n            Rehabilitation
