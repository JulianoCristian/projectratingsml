Some\n            lessons learned included: upfront consideration must be\n            given to a transition strategy for World Bank projects\n            supporting  Renewable Energy (RE)/Energy Efficiency (EE)\n            lending thorough a specialized financial institution to\n            address the future commercial bank competition that will\n            inevitably arise from successful project implementation.\n            Future challenges often include both direct financial\n            challenges as the commercial market is often able to provide\n            lower cost funding at more flexible terms, capacity\n            challenges including how to retain public sector staff once\n            the private sector enters the market, and institutional\n            challenges, as new directions are needed once original\n            objectives have been met. In order to adequately scale up\n            lending for renewable energy and energy efficiency, the\n            local banking sector must be an active participant.\n            Technical Assistance (TA) support can increase knowledge of\n            the technical, policy, and regulatory aspects of this market\n            to allow improved understanding of sector risks when\n            providing debt financing for such projects. Therefore,\n            awareness and capacity building of commercial financial\n            institutions for clean energy market development projects\n            should be incorporated into initial project designs, even\n            when primary lending activity is channeled through a single intermediary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Renewable Energy

The project has three components. The first\n            finances small hydro investments by the private sector in,\n            for example, canal-based and dam toe (sic) schemes,\n            run-of-river schemes, rehabilitation and/or upgrading of old\n            plants, use of tail ends of cooling water systems of thermal\n            power plants, and stand-alone micro-hydro schemes. The\n            project designs rural energy initiatives that feature\n            partnerships between private investors and user communities.\n            The second component helps design, develop, and implement\n            integrated energy management services operated by service\n            companies and end-users on a performance guarantee basis;\n            purchases and installs energy-efficient and/or load\n            management devices and systems; produces energy-efficient\n            equipment; and encourages end-user participation in the\n            state energy board and other utility-sponsored DSM programs.\n            The third component finances pre-investment activities that\n            develop a sustainable pipeline of energy-efficient\n            investments and standard bidding document preparation;\n            establish in-house capacity within IREDA (the Indian\n            Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited) to appraise,\n
