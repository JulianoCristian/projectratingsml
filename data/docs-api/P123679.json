Some lessons learned\n            included: the EGRG-I supported actions that maximized the\n            synergies with the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio in\n            telecommunications, education, IFMIS. It was much less\n            successful with the energy sector actions, which at the time\n            of the Board\u2019s approval of EGRG-I did not have a\n            complementary IDA investment project, in part reflecting\n            longstanding governance issues that have persisted. In the\n            interim, efforts to support the sector have progressed in\n            subsequent years, but significant challenges remain. This is\n            important, as the EGRG-I focused on institutional reforms,\n            where progress on capacity building requires a long-term\n            engagement and sustained political commitment. Capacity\n            building and economic adjustment efforts tend to succeed\n            when key performing civil servants are retained in position\n            for a reasonable period of time, and when there is\n            institutional stability to facilitate reform implementation.\n            The Gambian civil service, particularly at the more senior\n            levels, has been beset by a very high turnover of staff and\n            by frequent organizational reforms that have weakened\n            development progress and the sustainability of achieved\n            reforms. A positive example is education, where senior\n            management within the Government has remained relatively\n            intact for many years, which likely contributed to more\n            robust outcomes than in other areas. Given the frequent\n            shifts in staffing in the Government, enlisting buy-in from\n            more senior level Government officials might support\n            stronger reform outturns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia, The - First Economic Governance\n            Reform Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gambia, The - First Economic\n            Governance

This program\n            document is the First Economic Governance Reform Grant to\n            the Republic of The Gambia in the amount of SDR 3.9 million\n            (US$6.0 million equivalent). The grant is the first in a\n            series of two such Development Policy Grants (DPGs) covering\n            the period 2012 to 2013. It will support the implementation\n            of the country's Program for Accelerated Growth and\n            Employment (PAGE), which aims at improving the living\n            conditions of the Gambian population by implementing\n            cross-cutting reforms to diversify the economy and thereby\n            reduce its vulnerability to external shocks. It is organized\n            around the five pillar of the new development strategy: (i)\n            accelerating and sustaining economic growth; (ii) improving\n            and modernizing infrastructure; (iii) strengthening human\n            capital stock and enhancing access to social services; (iv)\n            improving governance and increasing economic\n            competitiveness; and (v) reinforcing social cohesion.\n            Therefore, the program document for this operation is being\n            presented alongside the joint staff advisory note on the\n            program for accelerated growth and employment. The grant\n            will also provide urgently-needed assistance to deal with\n            the recently-announced crop failure. Along with the rest of\n            the Sahelian countries of West Africa, The Gambia has\n            suffered from inadequate and erratic rainfall in 2011. The\n            full impact is now becoming apparent and the government has\n            officially requested emergency assistance from the\n            international
