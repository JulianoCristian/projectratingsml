Despite a\n            modest institutional development impact, both performances\n            by the Bank, and Borrower were unsatisfactory. Considering\n            the current quality assurance standards, project preparation\n            was deficient, with appraisal of works based only on\n            preliminary engineering designs, with very narrow remedial\n            action, particularly as it regards the underestimated\n            project cost increase of approximately seventy three\n            percent. Lessons show that the lack of a regulatory\n            framework, hindered the possibilities for the Karachi Water\n            and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to make full use of the support\n            provided by the project in strengthening the institution.\n            There was no regulatory action to give KWSB the autonomy to\n            exercise changes, neither in private sector involvement,\n            tariff adjustments, nor collection enforcement, changes\n            which could have improved service quality, in addition to\n            providing a sustainable management capacity, to offset\n            continued leaks, and prevent inequalities in resource\n            allocation. Furthermore, this lack of autonomy translates\n            into the financial covenants' limitations to assure\n            compliance, thus the usefulness of financial undertakings is\n            questioned, in the absence of governance, and adverse\n            commercial incentives, obstacles which could have ensured\n            the adequacy of water supply."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

Specific project components include : (i) a canal\n            and a square conduit to bring water from the Indus river,\n            four pumping stations, two direct filtration treatment\n            works, storage reservoirs, and the expansion/rehabilitation\n            of the distribution network; (ii) three new sewage treatment\n            works together with trunk sewers, cleaning of existing\n            sewers and the provision of small bore sewers to low-income\n            areas; and (iii) technical assistance to KWSB to enable it\n            to plan and execute large scale projects, improve operation\n            and maintenance, and improve and extend sanitation in the\n            city and coastal areas. The objectives of the project are\n            to: (a) increase potable water by 100 million gallons per\n            day and further augment water availability strengthening\n            loss reduction measures; (b) improve the financial avail of\n            the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) through\n            increased reven cost reductions, and increased operational\n            efficiency; (c) improve the organization and management of\n            KWSB; and (d) improve sanitation in Kar including its\n            low-income and coastal areas. The project has three mai\n            components: (a) water supply, including transmission works,\n            pumping s direct filtration treatment works, storage\n            reservoirs, distribution ma strengthening of the\n            distribution network; (b) institutional strengthe KWSB; and\n            (c) sanitation, including three sewage treatment works toget\n            associated trunk sewers, repair and cleaning of existing\n            sewers, and small-bore sewers for low income neighborhoods.\n            The project will plac increased emphasis on leak detection\n            and water loss reduction, contain operating costs, enhanced\n            revenue mobilization efforts, and an in-dept examination of\n            possible options for
