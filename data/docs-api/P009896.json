Some lessons learned\n            included: there is considerable industrial demand for gas.\n            Prior to the Project GOI focused primarily on the potential\n            use of gas as feedstock for fertilizer and petrochemical\n            production. However, the market development work which the\n            Project promoted encouraged GOI to look to demand from other\n            sectors. As it turned out, there is considerable industrial\n            sector demand for gas, especially in heat processing\n            operations. The use of technical assistance for onsite\n            managerial and operational expertise can be extremely\n            beneficial to project performance. Technical assistance\n            helped Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) improve its\n            performance under the Project, especially in the area of\n            onshore operations which had been neglected for some time.\n            In particular, the assistance resulted in the transfer of\n            technology for sophisticated well-completion techniques and\n            Pressure Maintenance Program (PMP) in the Gandhar field.\n            There is a need for greater dialogue on market-based gas\n            development planning. More commercialization of the gas\n            sector and long-term policy dialogue on pricing outside the\n            context of a specific project are necessary to achieve\n            greater efficiency and sustain some initial progress made in\n            the move to market-based resource allocation. The follow-up\n            Gas Flaring Reduction Project contains some covenants to\n            support this transition. In future projects, the Bank and\n            GOI have to work out clear indicators of progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Western Gas Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India

economic growth.  In particular, the project will:\n            expand production of the offshore South Bassein gas field\n            from 10 to 20 million cubic meters per day (MMCMD); support\n            initial development of the Gandhar gas field, which will\n            produce up to 3.5 MMCMD of gas; and eliminate flaring of\n            about 1 MMCMD of associated gas at the offshore Heera\n            oilfield, by linking it by pipeline to Bombay.  The project\n            will also appraise the potential of the outlying Tapti and\n            Hazira fields by seismic surveys for possible future\n            additions to  India's gas supply and

gas in India as a replacement for\n            imported petroleum products, thus saving substantial foreign\n            exchange, and helping to overcome energy shortages which\n            constrain economic growth.  In particular, the project will:\n            expand production of the offshore South Bassein gas field\n            from 10 to 20 million cubic meters per day (MMCMD); support\n            initial development of the Gandhar gas field, which will\n            produce up to 3.5 MMCMD of gas; and eliminate flaring of\n            about 1 MMCMD of associated gas at the offshore Heera\n            oilfield, by linking it by pipeline to Bombay.  The project\n            will also appraise the potential of the outlying Tapti and\n            Hazira fields by seismic surveys for possible future\n            additions to  India's gas supply and encourage optimal\n            planning of gas production and utilization in India, through\n            support for studies of the least-cost investments for field\n            development and transmission infrastructure for the western\n            region, and the uses of gas which yield the greatest\n            economic benefit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Western Gas Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Western Gas Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/01/739415/india-western-gas-development-project","projn":"IN-Western Gas Developm -- P009896","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Energy and Environment,Oil & Gas,Energy Trade,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926043604"},"subsc":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"barrel,Cement industry,coal,Coal\n            Mining,commercial energy,construction,consumption of\n            oil,crude oil,Crude oil price,domestic market,efficient\n            use,efficient use of energy,energy resources,energy\n            users,fuel,fuel oil,fuels,Gas,Gas Commission,gas\n            consumers,Gas Development,Gas Development Project,gas\n            field,gas fields,gas liquids,gas market,gas market\n            development,gas markets,Gas Pipeline,gas prices,gas\n            pricing,gas pricing policies,gas pricing policy,gas\n            processing,gas processing facility,gas production,gas\n            projects,gas reserves,gas sector,gas supplies,gas\n            treatment,gas use,gas users,gas utilization,Hydro\n            Power,industrial sector,Iron,Liquefied petroleum gas,Natural\n            gas,natural gas resources,Oil,oil and gas,oil and gas\n            sector,oil companies,oil imports,oil prices,oil\n            production,oil products,Petrochemicals,petroleum,petroleum\n            gas,petroleum products,Pipeline system,pipelines,power\n            plants,Power Stations,Power\n            Transmission,Pumps,Refineries,Rural Electrification,Thermal\n            Power,transmission,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"barrel,Cement industry,coal,Coal\n            Mining,commercial energy,construction,consumption of\n            oil,crude oil,Crude oil price,domestic market,efficient\n            use,efficient use of energy,energy resources,energy\n            users,fuel,fuel oil,fuels,Gas,Gas Commission,gas\n            consumers,Gas Development,Gas Development Project,gas\n            field,gas fields,gas liquids,gas market,gas market\n            development,gas markets,Gas Pipeline,gas prices,gas\n            pricing,gas pricing policies,gas pricing policy,gas\n            processing,gas processing facility,gas production,gas\n            projects,gas reserves,gas sector,gas supplies,gas\n            treatment,gas use,gas users,gas utilization,Hydro\n            Power,industrial sector,Iron,Liquefied petroleum gas,Natural\n            gas,natural gas resources,Oil,oil and gas,oil and gas\n            sector,oil companies,oil imports,oil prices,oil\n            production,oil products,Petrochemicals,petroleum,petroleum\n            gas,petroleum products,Pipeline system,pipelines,power\n            plants,Power Stations,Power\n            Transmission,Pumps,Refineries,Rural Electrification,Thermal\n            Power,transmission,Water Supply"}},"owner":"South Asia Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"P4724"},"facets":{}}}
