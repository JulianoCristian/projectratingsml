Some lessons learned included: The\n            road agency model has provided sufficient institutional\n            capacity in low income countries such as Tanzania and Uganda\n            to improve the delivery of new main roads and their\n            maintenance. Supporting road funds can further enhance road\n            sub-sector reform provided they are properly designed and\n            adequately resourced. During road reform initiatives, the\n            borrower's absorptive capacity, the degree of\n            opposition to change and the time it takes to prepare and\n            adopt new legislation, have often been miscalculated by the\n            Bank and other development partners. The Bank thus needs to\n            ensure appropriate training and skills deployment to i)\n            assess and address the borrower's institutional and\n            absorptive capacity limitations; ii) gauge the degree of\n            resistance to change and make a plan to deal with it, and\n            iii) realistically estimate the time it takes to prepare,\n            adopt and apply new legislation. An annual assessment of the\n            condition and traffic usage of the roads in the network\n            enables the decision makers and the public to understand the\n            implications of

- Road Sector Institutional Support\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Road Sector\n            Institutional Support Technical Assistance Project for\n            Uganda were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: Road Agency Formation Unit (RAFU)\n            was created as a default Project Implementation Unit (PIU)\n            and as a nucleus for the establishment of an autonomous road\n            authority and most of its salary and operational costs were\n            funded by the project. This was to mitigate the risks\n            related to sustainable government financing and to ensure\n            that the staff was well motivated to implement the costly\n            projects. However, it took long for government to prepare a\n            realistic budget to meet the requirements of Uganda National\n            Road Authority (UNRA) as the extended credit continued to\n            finance the salaries of RAFU. As such, this became a\n            disincentive for moving rapidly toward a government financed\n            road authority. The lesson is that the putting in place of a\n            PIU may be a disincentive for the implementation of\n            institutional reform. At project preparation, a set of good\n            outcome and impact indicators were designed, but no\n            framework was agreed to monitor project performance and as a\n            result no effective monitoring was carried out during\n            project implementation. Therefore to only design performance\n            indicators may not be enough unless a comprehensive\n            monitoring and assessment framework has been agreed upon\n            with all stakeholders at the project design stage. The\n            monitoring and assessment framework should include a time\n            based action plan to carry out baseline studies, regular\n            reviews of interim benchmarks, and a well coordinated\n            mechanism for evaluation and reporting of the project\n            performance at least biannually."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Road Sector Institutional Support\n

environmental effects of the project on social,\n            cultural, and economic resources, in a two-volume report\n            covering the Katunguru - Kasese - Fort Portal Road, and\n            Kasese - Kilembe Road - Equator Road segments. Measures to\n            mitigate adversity are: To reduce the effects of road\n            widening, those works within road reserves, should be\n            conducted after harvest period, and, for those outside road\n            reserve, compensation should be granted to affected\n            landowners. As a result of earthworks, borrow pits will be\n            available for waste, and spoil disposal, in an effort to\n            reduce hydrological damage. Noise, dust, and safety risks\n            will be minimized by limiting working hours to daytime\n            schedules, enforcing control measures to reduce traffic\n            speed, and, securing access to pedestrians, and cyclists\n            through adequate traffic signals, and temporary diversions.\n            During construction, health facilities will be available\n            on-site, to ensure the well-being of local workforce, and\n            communities. Maintenance of drainage infrastructure will be\n            pursued, to avoid potential flooding of adjacent properties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Executive
