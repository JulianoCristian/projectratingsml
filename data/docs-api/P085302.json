The Loan was approved by the\n            Board on June 22, 2004, but was not signed or made effective\n            within 18 months of Board approval. The Government of\n            Ecuador failed to meet the prerequisites for project\n            effectiveness, and the deadline for compliance was exceeded\n            in December 2005. The Government also did not submit the\n            required documents to support fulfillment of loan\n            conditionality's. Despite Bank efforts to assist the\n            Government of Ecuador with documentation requirements and\n            facilitate project effectiveness, the authorities appeared\n            to no longer be committed to project implementation. Some\n            lessons learned are: political instability complicates\n            project implementation; political instability affects\n            government leadership and commitment to
