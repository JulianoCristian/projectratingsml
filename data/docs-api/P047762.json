Some lessons learned\n            included: community involvement in the design,\n            implementation, operation and maintenance is a key factor to\n            sustainability. Community ownership that results from\n            involvement has stopped vandalizing water schemes. It has\n            contributed to the innovation of the 'water rate'\n            that works. Before the introduction of the participatory\n            approach, where the Central government was the only agent\n            involved in the provision of water, vandalizing of water\n            schemes was common. Now with the change in the incentive\n            system, communities are stakeholders and thus contribute to\n            maintaining the assets for the benefit of the community.\n            This project underscores that sustainability is a function\n            of incentives. Efforts to raise community contributions as\n            means of ensuring 'ownership' and commitment to\n            pay for water must be strengthened in districts where\n            contribution rates are low. The challenges posed by\n            collecting contributions from very poor communities were\n            widely recognized. Such communities might need longer\n            collection periods, and allowance for partial in-kind\n            contributions. Persistence and strong information campaigns\n            are needed where the perception of water as a 'free\n            good' remains strong. Developing the local market for\n            the construction industry and spare parts is key to\n            decentralized implementation. Development of the local\n            market is key to the efficient functioning of the private\n            sector and for project sustainability of district level\n            social service delivery activities. In the construction\n            sector, proper packaging of construction activities could\n            help to capture economies of scale and progressive\n            development of the local construction industry, create the\n            pool of skills and good practices. Availability of spare\n            parts in the local market could help compress the time\n            needed for repairs, lead to operational efficiency and is a\n            key element of sustainability of the schemes that involve\n            water pumps."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/12/10215592/tanzania-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project","projn":"TZ-Rural Water Supply And Sanitation Project\n            -- P047762","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20090202005249"},"theme":"Decentralization,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Other financial and private sector development,HIV/AIDS","subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sanitation,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to water, adequate water, affordable\n            water, agricultural production, appropriate technology,\n            beneficiary communities, boreholes, capacity building,\n            Central government, cleanliness, communicable diseases,\n            Community Contribution, community engagement, community\n            groups, community health, Community Involvement, community\n            leadership, community ownership, Community participation,\n            community sanitation, Community Water, Competitive Bidding,\n            construction, construction activities, construction\n            industry, contract management, cost recovery, cost sharing,\n            covering, cubic meter, cubic meter of water, decision\n            making, decision making process, deep wells, districts,\n            drilled wells, Engineer, Engineers, Environmental\n            Management, gender, gender equality, ground water,\n            groundwater, hand pump, hand pumps, hand washing, handpumps,\n            homes, hygiene, hygiene education, investment costs,\n            investment program, Irrigation, leasing, local operators,\n            local private operators, management of water, management of\n            water supply, motorized pumps, National Water Policy, number\n            of beneficiaries, operational capacity, operational\n            efficiency, ownership of assets, ownership of water,\n            Performance Indicators, pipes, Private operators, Private\n            Sector Operator, productive use of water, project\n            management, provision of water, pumping, pumping equipment,\n            quality of service, revenue generating capacity, rural\n            communities, rural development, rural settlements, RURAL\n            WATER, RURAL WATER SUPPLY, sanitation activities, sanitation\n            coverage, sanitation facilities, Sanitation Sector,\n            Sanitation service, sanitation service delivery, sanitation\n            services, service delivery, Service Provider, service\n            providers, settlement, shallow wells, small towns, sources\n            of water, spare parts, storage tanks, sustainable service\n            delivery, sustainable water, Town, valves, villages, waste\n            disposal, water collection, water collection time, Water\n            Department, Water Departments, water facilities, water fees,\n            water point, water points, Water Policy, water pumps, water\n            rates, water resource, water resource management, Water\n            Sanitation, water scheme, Water Schemes, Water Sector, Water\n            Sector Development, Water service, water supply service,\n            water user, wells"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Anglophone (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020954-UNDP-WORLD BANK WATER &\n            SANITATION PROGRAM,TF021664-NORWEGIAN GRANT TO WSP FOR E.\n            & S.

The project has three main\n            components. The first is initiated in three districts and\n            gradually expands to about 12 out of Tanzania's 113\n            districts. Activities include: support for establishing and\n            strengthening the operational capacity (equipment support\n            and training) of district water and sanitation teams (DWSTs)\n            to prepare district rural water supply and sanitation\n            plkans/plans and appraise RWSS sub-projects proposed by\n            communities; support for establishing district RWSS funds to\n            finance the construction of new RWSS schemes;the\n            rehabilitation and expansion of existing systems and\n            possibly other water-related small-scale infrastructure\n            investments; and assistance to communities in properly\n            managing and operating these systems through apprpriate\n            hygiene education as well as promoting HIV/AIDS mitigation\n            and prevention activities. The second compoent provides\n            sectoral conditional grants to about 250 communities to\n            improve the water supply and sanitation services. This\n            includes the construction or rehabilitation of existing dug\n            or drilled wells, boreholes equipped with handpumps or\n            powered pumps, spring tapping, piped systems, household\n            latrines, and community sanitation facilities.
