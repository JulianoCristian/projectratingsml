The project\n            has the following four components: Component 1) Irrigation\n            and Drainage objectives are to: (a) ensure sustainable use\n            of land and water resources for irrigated agriculture; (b)\n            increase agricultural productivity and reduce risks in\n            production; and (c) demonstrate a model of on-farm\n            irrigation development for agricultural modernization. The\n            component would include (i) physical construction that\n            comprises rehabilitation and extension of existing\n            irrigation works; and (ii) institutional support for a more\n            efficient and sustainable operation and maintenance of the\n            infrastructure, and the land and water resources for\n            irrigated agriculture. Component 2) The Farm Production\n            Improvement component will support improved agricultural\n            production. The component would specifically target those\n            farmers who benefit from the Irrigation and Drainage\n            Component. Component 3) Market Systems Development component\n            will: (a) increase farmers' access to markets; (b) add\n            value to farm products; (c) ensure efficient processing and\n            delivery of high value products from producers to consumers;\n            and (d) reduce transaction costs. The Component would focus\n            on activities that add value to the investments in\n            irrigation and drainage and in improved agricultural\n            production, consisting of: (i) financial support to\n            agro-enterprises and leading households; (ii) construction,\n            rehabilitation or up-grading of agricultural product\n            markets; (iii) promotion of quality standards and\n            improvements of market information systems; and (iv)\n            promotion of farmers' marketing groups (farmers'\n            professional associations). Component 4) Project Management,\n            Monitoring and Evaluation component will develop and\n            strengthen the overall implementation capacity of the\n            various levels of project management and promote effective\n            community participation in project activities. The component\n            includes: (i) project management; (ii) institutional\n            strengthening of PMOS (goods and training); (iii)\n            establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system that\n            includes environmental and social indicators (technical\n            assistance and training); and (iv) development of community\n            advisory/participation groups (technical assistance and training)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Jiangxi Integrated Agricultural\n            Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Jiangxi Integrated\n
