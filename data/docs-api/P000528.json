The lessons learned indicate that it\n            is important to tailor assistance to individual country\n            needs rather than try to make a general Bank policy fit all\n            countries, keeping sight of key objectives such as poverty\n            reduction and improved quality of life. Chad's country\n            situation had special characteristics that made it an\n            exception to general policies for petroleum development in\n            Africa. Project conditions should be defined clearly during\n            project preparation and should not evolve during\n            implementation. Rather than focusing on these special\n            conditions and the urgency for the Project, the Bank set new\n            and additional conditions on the project, especially by\n            insisting that private international oil companies take the\n            lead in the project when the interest was not there. In a\n            difficult country situation, there can be considerable value\n            to keep a small technical assistance project open and\n            maintain flexibility in its implementation. Delays in\n            development projects due to political and economic\n            instability in poor countries that depend on external\n            assistance have high costs to the economy and inhibit\n            poverty reduction. Technical Assistance projects should not\n            include implementation components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Petroleum and Power Engineering Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad -
