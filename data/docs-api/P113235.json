          Program (ERSG III) is the second in a programmatic series,\n            which was designed to assist the Government of Burundi (GoB)\n            to transform Burundi's economy from a post-conflict\n            context and to design and implement policies to accelerate\n            growth and promote human development, including through\n            private sector development. The ERSG III operation directly\n            follows on Second Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG II)\n            and will support the government to continue: (i) reforms in\n            the public finance management system to improve\n            accountability and transparency in public spending; (ii)\n            reforms in the business, legal, and institutional\n            environment to foster private sector-led growth; and (iii)\n            reforms in the coffee and domestic petroleum sub-sectors.\n            The program structure aims to maintain a balance between the\n            need for essential reforms and the simplicity dictated by\n            the weak institutions and implementation capacity. This\n            balance is maintained with a particular bias toward\n            deepening the reform process in areas already supported by\n            predecessor operations, where government's buy-in has\n            already been established. Overall, the program continues to\n            support the establishment of new legal and institutional\n            frameworks to implement essential reforms. Given the current\n            limits of fiscal space, it was also designed to help the\n            government to maintain adequate financial resources through:\n            (a) economic growth, (b) external financial assistance, and\n            (iii) debt relief. At the conclusion of the ERSG II-III\n            programmatic series, tangible progress with respect to each\n            component of the reform program is expected, including: 1)\n            measurable improvements in public finance management; 2)\n            measurable improvements in the environment for private\n            sector development; and 3) progress in the execution of the\n            reform program in the coffee and domestic petroleum sub-sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Third Economic Reform Support\n            Grant
