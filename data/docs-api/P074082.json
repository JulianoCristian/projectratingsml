To produce development results, the\n            Bank needs to pay attention to the design of the credit, the\n            quality of prior actions, and their relation to the expected\n            outcomes. PRSCs are unlikely to be as effective as\n            investment and sector operations for solving specific sector\n            issues. The PRSCs tended to cover macroeconomic and sector\n            issues in a broad manner, making it difficult to cultivate\n            ownership in the agencies responsible for implementing the\n            program. The assistance is more likely to succeed when the\n            Bank targets specific problems and works their solution with\n            the agencies in charge of executing the program. A program\n            of budget support tends to create a higher permanent level\n            of Government expenditure that may not be sustainable in the\n            medium term. Predictable budget support may create\n            inflexibilities in expenditure, forcing donors to continue\n            their support beyond what is needed and desirable. Uganda\n            exemplifies this situation as the PRSC series grew over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit

- Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Operation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Uganda Fourth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Operation Project has a satisfactory outcome, is\n            likely to be sustainable, and has a substantial\n            institutional development impact. The performances of both\n            the Bank and the Borrower are satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons cited were the following: 1) In Uganda, the project\n            was able to ensure specific reforms in local government\n            procurement and these were included in the Cabinet paper and\n            subsequently enshrined in law. Specific actions guiding\n            reforms in anti-corruption, financial management, management\n            of public finances and budget process were all realized. 2)\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) are most effective\n            when sequenced over a period of time, at least three years,\n            and where each PRSC builds on actions taken in previous\n            years. Expecting major reforms over a one-year period is\n            unrealistic. However, designing actions each year which lead\n            to outputs over a three year period is possible. 3)\n            Definition of measurable outputs which lead to improved\n            infant and maternal mortality is important. It is also\n            important that the design of these interim outputs and their\n            measurement is carried out in partnership with Government.\n            4) PRSCs may be the only external operational modality which\n            can get interaction between different Government ministries\n            on reforms: this strength of the PRSC instrument needs to be\n            used sparingly. 5) Coordination of PRSCs should be carried\n            out at the highest technical level of Government. When the\n            Office of the Prime Minister took over coordination, other\n            ministries were willing to recognize their right to\n            coordinate as this is the arrangement agreed within\n            Government. This ensured that very senior officials, often\n            Permanent Secretaries attended the various PRSC meetings and\n            ensured that the actions for which their ministry was\n            responsible were taken. 6) Lastly, it is critical that other\n            development partners are involved in the preparation of the PRSC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Fourth Poverty Reduction

        sequential annual Poverty Reduction Support operation\n            (PRSC4), financing one year of a medium-term program that\n            supports the implementation of Uganda's Second Poverty\n            Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) as summarized in the Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The grant provides support\n            to finance the implementation of long-term PEAP objectives\n            through support for three-year outputs and the policy\n            actions required to achieve these outputs. PRSC4 continues\n            support for the service delivery and rural development\n            reform program that was initiated under previous PRSCs, and\n            it sharpens the focus on gender, infant and maternal\n            mortality, and results- orientation. Currently, PRSC4 is the\n            only source of Bank finance for education, health, and water\n            and sanitation in Uganda. Like its three predecessors, PRSC4\n            has been developed in the expectation that the rolling\n            medium-term reform program will continue t o be supported by\n            subsequent PRSCs; this document thus describes both the\n            reforms financed under PRSC4 and the planned program for\n            possible financing by PRSCS and PRSC6. The PRSC supports\n            reforms under the four pillars of the second Poverty\n            Eradication Action Plan (PEAP): PEAP Pillar I: Creating a\n            framework for economic growth and structural transformation.\n            PEAP Pillar 2: Strengthening good governance and security.\n            PEAP Pillar 3: Increasing the ability of the poor to raise\n            their incomes.

Improve soil and water conservation, and\n            judiciously apply agricultural inputs. Ensure that\n            pesticides are used in accordance with integrated pest\n            management principles to offset using increasing quantities\n            of agrochemicals in agricultural activities. Observe the\n            maximum residue level for commercial crops, and train small\n            farmers in storing, handling, and applying agrochemicals, as\n            well as crop management. To reduce waste and effluent from\n            agro-processing, employ a waste management and environmental\n            audit for selected agro-processing facilities. Environmental\n            guidelines for road construction and maintenance works will\n            be developed and adopted. Improve institutional capacity for\n            transportation and environmental management, and train staff\n            and contractors. The health care waste strategy (HCW) raises\n            awareness; segregates special waste from other waste;\n            determines appropriate treatment technology; considers\n            facility-based versus disposal options; reduces waste\n            generation; monitors infection control and environmental\n            protection; uses appropriate technology for packaging,\n            transport, treatment, and disposal; develops a HCW\n            management plan for facilities; trains health care workers\n            in HCW management procedures; and addresses scavenging\n            issues. Mitigations applied to water supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) will include conducting random/selective environmental\n            audits for WSS facilities, and provides awareness training\n            for WSS professionals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda -
