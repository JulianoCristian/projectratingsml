The objective of the loan\n            was to provide capital support to banks under support of the\n            Government of India to enable them to maintain economic\n            stimulus programs to contain the effects of the global\n            crisis that began in 2008. The project was designed as a set\n            of two development policy lending operations. The first was\n            to provide budgetary support to the Government of India for\n            capital injection before June 2010. The second loan in this\n            program was expected to calibrate and reflect specific\n            financing needs and include a program of policy and\n            regulatory. The second loan did not materialize. However,\n            despite the overall success of the design and the outcome,\n            this assessment identified a number of issues, resulting in\n            important lessons learned by the Bank in responding to its\n            clients during periods of major crises. (1) Greater clarity\n            in the project document was needed to underpin the second\n            operation and loan. (2) The processing of the operation\n            could have been more rapid; actual disbursement of funds\n            happened a considerable time after the global crisis broke.\n            (3) While arguments against the use of a deferred drawdown\n            option are strong in retrospect, there should have been\n            greater prior dialogue with the Government of India on\n            crisis response."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Banking Sector Support Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Banking Sector Support\n            Loan

Support Loan (BSSL) in a set of two\n            programmatic development policy loans (DPL) to the Republic\n            of India. It responds to a request from the Government to\n            provide financial support to enable the authorities to\n            continue implementing their economic stimulus program, which\n            is intended to contain the effects of the global economic\n            crisis on the Indian economy. An important part of the\n            overall stimulus program is the provision of capital support\n            to public sector banks (PSB). This will help maintain the\n            confidence of the public in the banking sector, prevent\n            shortages of capital from leading to a slowdown in credit\n            growth, and provide a capital buffer to public sector banks\n            to absorb the possible increase in non-performing assets\n            (NPA) resulting from the global financial crisis and its\n            impact on India's economy. India's Gross Domestic\n            Product (GDP) growth slowed from a peak 9.7 percent in\n            2006-07 to about 5-6 percent in the third and fourth\n            quarters of 2008-09, and is projected to remain in the\n            5.5-6.5 percent range in 2009-10, a sharp drop with adverse\n            implications for employment and poverty reduction, and on\n            investment for long-term growth. The first BSSL will address\n            needs arising from the current economic slowdown. Continued\n            credit expansion by the banking system will complement the\n            comprehensive stimulus measures that the Government has put\n            in place since mid-2008, which include monetary, trade,\n            fiscal, and financial sector actions, and will limit the\n            slowdown before it becomes too deep."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Banking Sector Support
