The project\n            strategy relied squarely on the strong leadership role of\n            personalities, rather than placing the project within an\n            institutionally strong agency. This strategy collapsed with\n            the change of government. Project implementation improved\n            dramatically when incentives for reform were identified and\n            the main stakeholders of reforms took the driver's\n            seat. Fiscal constraints created incentives to improve\n            revenue collection, and the Ministry of Finance strongly\n            supported reforms in collection agencies and control of the\n            payroll. The Ministry of Finance took the leadership of the\n            project and promoted reforms in Tax and Customs Agencies, as\n            well on civil service wage bill management. Positive results\n            in Civil Service Reform should be expanded across all levels\n            of governments and enhanced with the implementation of\n            policies for a merit-based promotion system and a new\n            structure of salaries. Mechanisms to promote and facilitate\n            access of indigenous people to the Civil Service-a very\n            important policy in the Government agenda can be\n            strengthened if the Civil Service reform continues in this\n            direction. Strong analytical work could have provided\n            information about alternatives for reform and reduced the\n            expectations generated by the project's ambitious\n            design. Analytical work performed during project\n            implementation demonstrated that the Financial\n            Administration and Control System (SAFCO) legal framework\n            needed to be improved due to weak regulations and the\n            prevalence of informal practices in the budget process. The\n            studies also showed that Integrated Public Financial\n            Management System (SIGMA) has important weaknesses. Had this\n            information been available earlier, a more adequate strategy\n            to introduce a results-based management reform could have\n            been designed for the project. Strengthening the regulatory\n            framework and information technology systems should be\n            guaranteed before introducing a results-based management system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Institutional Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Institutional Reform

Institutional Reform Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Institutional Reform Project, the\n            first phase of the Public Sector Modernization Project seeks\n            to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency\n            of the Bolivian administration in order to strengthen the\n            country's ability to implement its economic and social\n            development programs and thus combat poverty. There are five\n            project components. The first, the performance evaluation\n            component, adjusts the regulatory framework, designs and\n            launches management and evaluation systems, and builds the\n            capacity of the rector agencies. The second component,\n            builds national integrity by combating corruption through\n            reforming the legal framework, developing prevention\n            policies and mechanisms, setting up an ombudsman's\n            office, streamlining bureaucratic procedures, reforming the\n            procurement process, and increasing social communication,\n            particularly a massive citizen education program. The civil\n            service component implements the legal framework, develops\n            personnel systems, and builds the capacity of the rector\n            institutions. The fourth component, organizational reform,\n            restructures the pilot agencies, supports professional cadre\n            positions in the ministries, and reforms the budget. The\n            fifth component, reform management, funds the entity serving\n            as the project coordination unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Institutional Reform
