Some lessons learned included:\n            living in absolute poverty, people give priority to food\n            security and income generation. Since environmental\n            interventions such as tree planting and soil and water\n            conservation normally take a long time for desired benefits\n            to be generated, integrating pro-poor, livelihood\n            enhancement options that produce immediate economic gains\n            into community-driven activities was essential to sustain\n            communities' motivation and cohesion. This also helped\n            participating communities understand linkages with broader\n            environmental benefits. At the initial stage, the project\n            had to deal with resistance to project interventions due to\n            cultural beliefs and practices the communities had. The\n            project revealed that changing local mindsets required\n            patient and tireless efforts as communities had a steep\n            learning curve. However, once the positive results of the\n            new technologies became apparent, communities became quite\n            cooperative and eager to expand their activities, revealing\n            the potential to amplify the Project outcomes. The project\n            did not effectively curb already extensively degraded areas\n            such as gullies in the lower Nyando since it could not\n            sufficiently extend its resources to upstream interventions.\n            A holistic approach at the entire catchment level should be\n            used to address critical degradation causes to better\n            regulate water flows in the catchment and subsequently\n            achieve economic and environmental sustainability. The\n            project performance was significantly affected by\n            unavailability of anticipated co-financing as well as low\n            institutional capacity for project implementation, which\n            required close supervision and an adaptive management\n            approach at all stages of Project implementation. In\n            addition, modifying Project design (e.g., reducing scope and\n            areas of intervention) should be considered early on to\n            ensure that the adjusted Project can achieve tangible results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Western Kenya Integrated\n

Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem\n            Management Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The key development goals of the project\n            are to reverse land degradation, and promote\n            income-generating activities for rural farmers in Western\n            Kenya, and, to contribute to improved rural water quality.\n            The global objectives of the project are to create\n            opportunities to sequester carbon, conserve biodiversity,\n            and improve the quality of international waters. Major\n            project activities include: reforestation and afforestation,\n            utilization of appropriate farming technologies, controlled\n            grazing, introduction of improved fallows, improvement of\n            soil fertility through agroforestry and chemical\n            fertilizers, introduction of high value trees and fodder,\n            promotion of livestock, flood control measures, various\n            water management options, and, re-seeding of pasture.\n            Although, potential environmental impacts of these\n            activities were assessed, mostly positive, leading to\n            improvements in environmental health, food security and a\n            lower incidence of diseases, certain activities however,\n            were identified as likely to lead to significant negative\n            environmental impacts. It is probable that a massive\n            afforestation/reforestation could negatively affect both\n            surface, and groundwater supplies if care is not taken\n            regarding selection of tree species, their placement on the\n            landscape, and management. Use of chemical fertilizers could\n            cumulatively make worse the eutrophication problems of the\n            Lake Victoria ecosystem. The project could also lead to\n            social disparities due to differences amongst communities,\n            or social groups accessing project resources and\n            information. This environmental management plan provides the\n            following mitigation measures. Reduction of surface and\n            ground water availability will be minimized by a select\n            intervention of sites, tree species, tree management, and\n            placement on the landscape carefully to avoid water source\n            areas. Pollution of water bodies leading to their\n            eutrophication, due to the use of chemical fertilizers and\n            animal wastes should be mitigated by the application of the\n            correct types of fertilizers, and the correct amount and\n            timing of application."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem\n            Management Project :

- Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem\n            Management Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The key development goals of the project\n            are to reverse land degradation, and promote\n            income-generating activities for rural farmers in Western\n            Kenya, and, to contribute to improved rural water quality.\n            The global objectives of the project are to create\n            opportunities to sequester carbon, conserve biodiversity,\n            and improve the quality of international waters. Major\n            project activities include: reforestation and afforestation,\n            utilization of appropriate farming technologies, controlled\n            grazing, introduction of improved fallows, improvement of\n            soil fertility through agroforestry and chemical\n            fertilizers, introduction of high value trees and fodder,\n            promotion of livestock, flood control measures, various\n            water management options, and, re-seeding of pasture.\n            Although, potential environmental impacts of these\n            activities were assessed, mostly positive, leading to\n            improvements in environmental health, food security and a\n            lower incidence of diseases, certain activities however,\n            were identified as likely to lead to significant negative\n            environmental impacts. It is probable that a massive\n            afforestation/reforestation could negatively affect both\n            surface, and groundwater supplies if care is not taken\n            regarding selection of tree species, their placement on the\n            landscape, and management. Use of chemical fertilizers could\n            cumulatively make worse the eutrophication problems of the\n            Lake Victoria ecosystem. The project could also lead to\n            social disparities due to differences amongst communities,\n            or social groups accessing project resources and\n            information. This environmental management plan provides the\n            following mitigation measures. Reduction of surface and\n            ground water availability will be minimized by a select\n            intervention of sites, tree species, tree management, and\n            placement on the landscape carefully to avoid water source\n            areas. Pollution of water bodies leading to their\n            eutrophication, due to the use of chemical fertilizers and\n            animal wastes should be mitigated by the application of the\n            correct types of fertilizers, and the correct amount and\n            timing of application."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem\n            Management Project :
