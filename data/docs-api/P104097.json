Ratings for the One-Two Public\n            Investment Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: excessive flexibility regarding the policy\n            content of a programmatic series weakens the program.\n            Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy\n            lending, there is room for striking a better balance between\n            flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially met triggers\n            as prior actions should be considered with particular\n            caution. Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and\n            other external partners to withdraw their support for weakly\n            implemented reform programs and unproductive policy dialogue\n            can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations.\n            The delays in the second operations of P135 and PIR, and\n            PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns with program\n            quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in\n            the case of P135. Arguments for budget predictability under\n            the Paris Declaration are less relevant in Vietnam due to\n            relatively small share of budget support in public\n            expenditures. A strong knowledge base is of critical\n            importance for upstream design of reforms and parallel\n            technical assistance to support their implementation.\n            Selectivity

Both the Bank and the borrower\n            performances were moderately satisfactory. Several lessons\n            have been learned: (1) Accountability for the program should\n            be clearly with Government.  (2) The primary implementing\n            agency needs both administrative and donor engagement\n            skills. There needs to be sufficient capacity at the center\n            of Government to simultaneously administer the program,\n            interact with donors, and coordinate amongst ministries and\n            levels of government. (3) Different reforms will require\n            different time frames to move from agreement to\n            implementation. (4) Joint monitoring of the program requires\n            clear indicators agreed prior to implementation. (5)\n            Cross-sector programs require a clear understanding of\n            incentives faced by all implementing agencies. (6) Formal\n            mechanisms are required to ensure that sub-national entities\n            are on-board with both the program design and implementation\n            of reforms. (7) TA is critical to reinforce reforms at the\n            local levels charged with implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - First Program 135 Second Phase\n            Support Operation for

one of the best\n            performing economies in the world over the last decade. It\n            has become increasingly integrated with the world economy,\n            and formally joined the WTO in January 2007. This first\n            credit in a programmatic series of three, would support\n            policy and institutional actions to improve the results of\n            one of Vietnam's principal National Target Programs\n            (NTP) for poverty reduction: the re-designed Program for\n            Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme\n            Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas\n            (2006-2010), known more familiarly in Vietnam as Program\n            135, Phase 2 (P135-2). The credit would support policy and\n            institutional actions to improve the results of P135-2 with\n            particular reference to: (i) improved poverty targeting of\n            program resource allocation; (ii) deepening and scaling-up\n            of community-driven approaches to planning, managing,\n            operating and maintaining basic rural infrastructure; (iii)\n            enhanced fiduciary transparency and accountability in\n            program implementation through wider use of social audit\n            approaches; and (iv) process monitoring and impact\n            evaluation. Critical aspects of this reform agenda have\n            already been demonstrated at scale under ongoing IDA- and\n            other ODA-supported initiatives in Vietnam covering at least\n            a half of all the provinces, districts and communes targeted\n            for inclusion in P135-2 (see maps and Annex 7). Those\n            elements of the reform agenda supported by the proposed\n            series of operations are described in the attached Letter of\n            Development Policy (Annex
