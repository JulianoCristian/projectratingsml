Some lessons\n            learned included: the 'Tianziling method of landfill\n            operations', developed by Hangzhou Solid Waste Company,\n            Limited (HSWC), controls surface water runoff entry and\n            ground water entering the landfill by introducing a High\n            Density Polyethylene (HDPE) membrane cover instead of the\n            generally used soil cover. This method reduces leach-ate\n            generation and cost of land-filling, prevents odor, and\n            increases the life of the landfill. Inclusion of industrial\n            pollution action plan (IPCAP) in ZUEP addressed pollution\n            control in a comprehensive manner, and included: a licensing\n            and permit system for industry pollution control; database\n            of pollution types and sources; industrial pollution\n            monitoring program; water conservation; and catchment\n            pollution control plan. The project experience in China has\n            found that local communities, especially the poor, often\n            have little appreciation for what tourists want or need.\n            Services and souvenirs are generally of low quality and\n            provide only small incomes. Related training provided by\n            government entities/Associations often lags the most current\n            approaches. In order to generate sustainable economic\n            opportunities based on cultural heritage conservation and\n            tourism, project planning and design should include specific\n            attention to useful training, sound planning and realistic\n            investments. Sustainable historic city revitalization\n            requires a holistic approach, and the Bank has the unique\n            ability to assemble multi-disciplinary task teams to design\n            and supervise projects using this approach. The Bank is also\n            distinct from most conservation and tourism organizations in\n            its ability to set projects within a development and poverty\n            reduction context."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Zhejiang Urban Environment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Zhejiang Urban\n            Environment

efficient\n            modern urban management system so as to maintain urban\n            ecological balance and improve environmental quality.\n            Overall, while the potential positive environmental impacts\n            resulting from the implementation of the Zhejiang Urban\n            Environment Project are large, construction and operation\n            impacts may induce environmental adversity, preventable if\n            successfully mitigated as follows. Environmental\n            strengthening is considered a critical component of the\n            project, and a detailed technical assistance program is\n            being developed to address such needs. This includes\n            training in management, and operations, in a wide variety of\n            disciplines. Water quality standards in river systems,\n            lakes, and reservoirs should be raised by 5-10 percent\n            points, while standards on the basis of functional zoning of\n            lakes and reservoirs should be raised over 70 percent. Water\n            quality indicators should be controlled in the offshore sea\n            areas according to the functional zoning requirements, and\n            improved year by year. By 2005, the discharge amounts of\n            SO2, dusts - smoke, and industrial ashes - COD, NH3-N,\n            industrial solid wastes, and other main pollutants should be\n            ten percent less than those in 2000, while major\n            environmental protection cities should meet a standard of\n            100 percent in surface water quality. Similarly, centralized\n            urban wastewater treatment rates should raise standards by\n            45-60 percent, while urban domestic treatment rates (with no\n            harmful effects) should meet a 90 percent acceptance\n            standard. Public green surfaces should be above 8 square\n            meters per capita in cities, planning to reach new green\n            surface, and landscape coverage rates, by 30-35 percent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental impact assessment report for\n            Ningbo Jiangnan WWTP and sewer networks"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Zhejiang Urban\n            Environment Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 9) :\n            Environmental impact assessment report for Ningbo Jiangnan\n            WWTP and sewer networks"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/04/10572449/china-zhejiang-urban-environment-project-environmental-assessment-vol-9-environmental-impact-assessment-report-ningbo-jiangnan-wwtp-sewer-networks","projn":"CN-Zhejiang Urban Environment Project -- P066955","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water and Industry,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Sanitation and Sewerage","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Ningbo Environmental Protection Science\n            Research and DesignInstitute"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20090519003250"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Other social services,Roads and highways,Solid waste management,Water supply","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"Chinese","historic_topic":"Environment,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment;
