The lesson learned was the following:  An\n            agency was established by legislation and a staff of six\n            persons was employed to implement the project. As it\n            eventuated, activity was not adequate to keep the staff\n            fully and actively employed except in the set up period of\n            training and the initial marketing. The Project Appraisal\n            Document envisaged that the agency would be able to continue\n            in existence after the project closed as a guarantee agency\n            and provide support for cross border trade including export\n            credit insurance. The project description in Part B of\n            Schedule 2 envisaged the continuation of the project in the\n            form of a guarantee agency unsupported by the World Bank but\n            only after the project had closed at the end of January\n            2003. The form of insurance or guarantees envisaged by Part\n            B, such as export credit insurance, are related but more\n            complex functions than providing political risk only\n            guarantees. In retrospect, the objectives of the Project\n            would have been better achieved by allowing the agency\n            during the project implementation period to use the project\n            funds on other related activities such as export credit\n            insurance, subject to similar controls and restrictions as\n            applied in the use of political risk insurance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Private Industry Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Private Industry\n            Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/08/5074613/albania-private-industry-recovery-project","projn":"AL-Private Industry Recovery Project -- P051602","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Insurance & Risk Mitigation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009486_20040901121628"},"subsc":"Banking,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets, auditors, Bank management, Bank\n            Performance, bid, cancellation, certificates, credit\n            guarantees, credit insurance, cross border trade, CURRENCY,\n            economic activity, economic growth, employment, exchange\n            rates, Expenditure, exposure, expropriation, financial\n            institutions, financial leasing, financial loss, Financial\n            rate of return, Financial Sector, Financial Sector\n            Development, FISCAL YEAR, guidelines, Institutional\n            Development, insurance, interest income, International\n            Development, key performance indicators, legislation,\n            letters of credit, local government, macroeconomic\n            stability, microfinance, operating costs, operating\n            expenses, operational costs, Project Costs, pyramid scheme,\n            rate of return, subsidiary, Technical Assistance, working capital"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025531-PHRD-PRIVATE INDUSTRY RECOVERY PROJECT","repnb":"29826"},"2020250":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/06/2020250/albania-private-industry-recovery-project-environmental-assessment","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/06/2020250/albania-private-industry-recovery-project-environmental-assessment","new_url":"2002/06/2020250/albania-private-industry-recovery-project-environmental-assessment","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/10/18/000094946_02100404282197/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/10/18/000094946_02100404282197/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"3038","datestored":"2002-10-18T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2002-06-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Albania - Private Industry Recovery Project\n            : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Before a loan will be approved under the\n            Private Industry Recovery Project for Albania, it must be\n            verified that the enterprise has valid municipal, city,\n            canton, or state licenses to operate including the\n            environmental license, and that the operations, respecting\n            the nominated exports, will be in accord with the applicable\n            environmental law and standards of Albania and the\n            guidelines for environmental assessment listed in this\n            report.

Private Industry Recovery Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objective of the Private\n            Industry Recovery Project is to foster a speedy revival of\n            the private manufacturing sector after its collapse as a\n            consequence of the recent political instability. The project\n            will finance Albanian Guarantee Agency (AGA), which will\n            issue guarantees to entities that finance productive\n            activities in Albania. The project consists of three\n            components. 1) Albania will contribute US$0.7 million as\n            issued and paid-in capital for AGA. 2) Start-up costs\n            (US$0.25 million) of the Albania Guarantee Agency will cover\n            AGA's initial start-up costs for capital expenditures\n            and administrative expenses in its first year. 3) Political\n            Risks Guarantee Facility (US$20 million), managed by AGA,\n            will mitigate the perceived risks that are preventing the\n            private sector from having access to commercial financing\n            for productive transactions or from risking their own funds\n            to re-enter the market. As guarantees are issued, the funds\n            will be placed in escrow with an agent bank outside Albania\n            under liability until the guarantee runs off. The agent bank\n            will also issue the beneficiary of the AGA an irrevocable\n            standby letter of credit to ensure security."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Private Industry Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Private Industry\n            Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/01/693800/albania-private-industry-recovery-project","projn":"AL-Private Industry Recovery Project -- P051602","subtopic":"Insurance & Risk Mitigation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980219162602"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Banking","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-1","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,applications,Bank of\n            Greece,banking sector,beneficiaries,Benefit Analysis,capital\n            expenditures,capital goods,commercial\n            credit,conditionality,Cost Effectiveness,Cost Effectiveness\n            Analysis,coverage,disasters,domestic credit,economic\n            activity,economic analysis,economic growth,economic\n            stability,employment,environmental regulations,Exchange\n            Rate,financial institutions,financial leverage,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,Fixed costs,foreign banks,foreign\n            exchange,Guidelines,import\n            tariffs,imports,inflation,institutional development,Interest\n            income,Islamic Bank,key performance indicators,laws,legal\n            framework,local enterprises,macroeconomic\n            conditions,operating costs,operating\n            expenses,Pollution,private banks,private commercial\n            banks,programs,Project Financing,rates,risk premium,risk\n            sharing,Savings,Special Drawing Rights,state\n            banks,Sustainability,technical\n            assistance,Transparency,underwriting,Variable costs,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,applications,Bank of\n            Greece,banking sector,beneficiaries,Benefit Analysis,capital\n            expenditures,capital goods,commercial\n            credit,conditionality,Cost Effectiveness,Cost Effectiveness\n            Analysis,coverage,disasters,domestic credit,economic\n            activity,economic analysis,economic growth,economic\n            stability,employment,environmental regulations,Exchange\n            Rate,financial institutions,financial leverage,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,Fixed costs,foreign banks,foreign\n            exchange,Guidelines,import\n            tariffs,imports,inflation,institutional development,Interest\n            income,Islamic Bank,key performance indicators,laws,legal\n            framework,local enterprises,macroeconomic\n            conditions,operating costs,operating\n            expenses,Pollution,private banks,private commercial\n            banks,programs,Project Financing,rates,risk premium,risk\n            sharing,Savings,Special Drawing Rights,state\n            banks,Sustainability,technical\n            assistance,Transparency,underwriting,Variable costs,working capital"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025531-PHRD-PRIVATE INDUSTRY RECOVERY PROJECT","repnb":"17163"},"facets":{}}}
