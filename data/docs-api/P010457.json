Some of the key\n            lessons learned from the implementation include: Political\n            commitment at both the state and central government level is\n            critical for state ownership, successful implementation, and\n            project sustainability. Continuity of the core project team,\n            as well as the Project Director and critical staff in key\n            positions is pivotal for the successful implementation of\n            time bound projects. Management structures and\n            implementation arrangements for the project need to be\n            relevant to the state context and environment. Ensuring\n            adequate funds flow is critical for smooth implementation of\n            the project. The large work force in the health sector\n            justifies the need to have in-house training capacity and\n            facilities. All the training should be part of a human\n            resource development strategy. Strategic choices regarding\n            the roles of the public and private sectors need to be made\n            based on the core strengths of the sectors, institutional\n            needs, and the current capacity of the sector. Involving\n            local communities in sighting of health facilities is\n            crucial in ensuring access. Supervision by the Bank and the\n            government should be heightened to yield better outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Family Welfare (Assam, Rajasthan and\n            Karnataka) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Family Welfare (Assam,\n            Rajasthan and Karnataka) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1955260/india-family-welfare-assam-rajasthan-karnataka-project","projn":"IN-Family Welfare Project -- P010457","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,National Governance,Social Protections & Assistance","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02072504042455"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"authorization,Birth Rate,clinics,Community\n            Health,community participation,Competitive Bidding,Death\n            Rate,decentralization,decision\n            making,districts,equipment,Expenditure,extension,family\n            planning,Family Welfare,financial management,Financial rate\n            of return,FISCAL,girls,health care,health\n            education,houses,Housing,human\n            resources,immunization,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Development,integration,isolation,media,mobile\n            clinics,mobility,Mortality,needs\n            assessment,negotiations,NGOs,partnership,physical\n            infrastructure,posters,pregnancy,private sector,project\n            plan,Public Health,public\n            system,radio,rationalization,rehabilitation,rural\n            communities,rural development,salaries,Slums,special\n            needs,STAFF,state budget,state funds,state\n            Government,Welfare activities,Wood,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"authorization,Birth Rate,clinics,Community\n            Health,community participation,Competitive Bidding,Death\n            Rate,decentralization,decision\n            making,districts,equipment,Expenditure,extension,family\n            planning,Family Welfare,financial management,Financial rate\n            of return,FISCAL,girls,health care,health\n            education,houses,Housing,human\n            resources,immunization,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Development,integration,isolation,media,mobile\n            clinics,mobility,Mortality,needs\n            assessment,negotiations,NGOs,partnership,physical\n            infrastructure,posters,pregnancy,private sector,project\n            plan,Public Health,public\n            system,radio,rationalization,rehabilitation,rural\n            communities,rural development,salaries,Slums,special\n            needs,STAFF,state budget,state funds,state\n            Government,Welfare activities,Wood,workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
