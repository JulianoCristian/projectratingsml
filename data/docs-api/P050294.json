Third Fiscal Restructuring and\n            Deregulation Program Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project outcome is unsatisfactory,\n            sustainability unlikely, having attained only modest\n            institutional development impacts. While the risks of\n            significant lack of follow-through were previously\n            described, it would not have been sufficient for this nature\n            of operation, where the window of opportunity is small, and\n            the benefits lie in maintaining the general direction of\n            reform, rather than taking quantum steps. This said, it is\n            important that credit amounts be maintained at levels which\n            are commensurate with the measures being undertaken. The\n            originally proposed two tranche operation might have been\n            back-loaded, given the weight attached to conditions for\n            second tranche release. However, the increase in the size of\n            the first tranche relative to the amount agreed with the\n            government, sends wrong signals to the borrower, and reduces\n            the credibility of our follow-up operations. In addition, as\n            mentioned above, the funds were not used to capitalize the\n            National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA), which had been the\n            motivation for topping-up. Two areas of the credit represent\n            major successes where the Malawian experience may be\n            replicable for other countries. The approach of setting up\n            an independent revenue authority with a fixed percentage of\n            collections allocation for its operations, seems to have\n            worked well in providing the motivation which the agency\n            needed. Secondly, Malawi's success in privatizing both\n            the commercial banks, and petroleum import sector in a small\n            market where there is only room for a limited number of\n            enterprises, suggests that with setting appropriate rules,\n            these can still result in significant efficiency gains. This\n            operation underlines the importance of having good analytic\n            work as a basis for Bank lending and support to governments,\n            analytic work which needs to be designed strategically, to\n            avoid the risk of designing conditionality in the areas\n            where solid analytical underpinnings already exist, instead\n            of focusing on areas which are critical to the overall\n            success of the Government's reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Third Fiscal Restructuring and\n            Deregulation Program
