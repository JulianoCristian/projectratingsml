This rating is based both on a failure to\n            achieve key development objectives and on the uncertain\n            sustainability of project gains at the time of the ICR. The\n            ultimate outcome of the project as well as the maintenance\n            of the assets and resources provided are threatened by the\n            Kenya Wildlife Service's (KWS) deteriorating financial\n            position and related management weaknesses, and by\n            shortcomings in the policy framework and public investment\n            program relating to the wildlife and tourism sector. If\n            KWS' current efforts to address these problems succeed,\n            the outlook for sustainability will improve. While World\n            Bank performance is rated satisfactory, Borrower performance\n            is not. The lessons identified by KWS in their ICR are\n            largely consistent with those identified in this report (the\n            need to ensure capacity--policy-making and legal,\n            governance, institutional capacity--is in place prior to\n            making major investments; the dangers of relying on external\n            consultants for capacity building; the requirement of a\n            training needs assessment linked to other components; the\n            need to consider recurrent costs in maintaining required\n            infrastructure and equipment, etc.).Overall, the KWS ICR\n            focuses on achieving activities as opposed to outcomes as\n            this report does. As a result, the KWS' own assessment\n            is considerably more positive. This difference in perception\n            should be followed up so that all parties derive maximum\n            benefit from ICR exercises."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Protected Areas and Wildlife\n            Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Protected Areas and\n            Wildlife Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/04/728879/kenya-protected-areas-wildlife-services-project","projn":"KE-Wildlife Services Pr -- P001345","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Research,ICT Policy and Strategies,Teaching and Learning,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Education","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00062405322361"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,Achievement,achievements,air,auditors,Bank\n            Performance,Biodiversity,business development,capacity\n            building,deficits,employment,Environmental Impact,financial\n            management,financial performance,financial planning,fiscal\n            year,GIS,housing,impact assessment,information\n            transfer,intervention,land\n            use,legislation,let,livestock,management information\n            systems,marketing,natural resources,Needs\n            Assessment,operating costs,operating\n            expenditures,Papers,Partnership,personality,private\n            sector,Programs,reorganization,Technical\n            Assistance,technicians,United States Agency for\n            International Development,USAID,vouchers"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,Achievement,achievements,air,auditors,Bank\n            Performance,Biodiversity,business development,capacity\n            building,deficits,employment,Environmental Impact,financial\n            management,financial performance,financial planning,fiscal\n            year,GIS,housing,impact assessment,information\n            transfer,intervention,land\n            use,legislation,let,livestock,management information\n            systems,marketing,natural resources,Needs\n            Assessment,operating costs,operating\n            expenditures,Papers,Partnership,personality,private\n            sector,Programs,reorganization,Technical\n            Assistance,technicians,United States Agency for\n            International Development,USAID,vouchers"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 4 (AFTS4)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026770-WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF023550-GLO.
