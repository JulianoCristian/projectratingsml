The project largely\n            achieved its principal objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was substantial, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of the both Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, project design should be kept simple, with\n            manageable components that can be handled through a single\n            or few agencies. Second, project preparation needs to be\n            improved to minimize costly variations during\n            implementation. Third, pre-qualification procedures need to\n            be improved in line with the Bank's current standard\n            pre-qualification documents and rigorously implemented to\n            avoid awarding contracts to firms lacking capacity. Fourth,\n            highway sector investments should be carefully prioritized\n            to ensure timely availability of counterpart funds. Fifth,\n            alternative off-budget highway maintenance arrangements are\n            needed to provide an adequate and reliable source of highway\n            maintenance funding. Sixth, vehicle overloading must be\n            effectively addressed to sustain highway network\n            improvements. Finally, the use of local/in-country expertise\n            should be maximized to reduce reliance on costly long-term\n            expatriate input over extended periods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fourth Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Fourth Highway
