In Madagascar, it\n            was the first project of this scope and size working with\n            communities and nongovernmental organizations. One important\n            outcome is that it has clearly demonstrated the benefits of\n            such an approach on a scale which goes beyond previous\n            attempts by pilot type operations. Given the project\n            objectives as interpreted above, the outcome of the various\n            components can be rated as satisfactory. Other key lessons\n            learned include: The project's effectiveness was\n            reinforced by the \"contracting approach.\" Strong\n            national leadership and continuity is very important for the\n            success of any community nutrition project. The community\n            should know from the time of entry that the program will not\n            go on forever: a satisfactory community exit strategy should\n            be defined and should gain acceptance. A successful program\n            design includes program flexibility and training.\n            Implementation plans and manuals of procedure facilitate a\n            speedy and smooth implementation. Promoting behavioral\n            changes through well-designed and conducted information\n            campaigns (IEC) are important to sustain project objectives.\n            An IEC strategy and program designed by nationals having an\n            intimate understanding of local behavior and customs can\n            have a high impact at low cost. The delegated contract\n            management approach works well and at a reasonable cost in\n            rural and urban areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Food Security and Nutrition
