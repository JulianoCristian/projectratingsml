Some lessons learned included: in a country\n            like Indonesia where the institutions bearing on land rights\n            are poorly defined and not transparently administered, the\n            priority needs to be championing legal and policy reform; in\n            these circumstances, a project that pays less attention to\n            reform than to land titling is unlikely to lead to a\n            sustained increase in tenure security. This project\n            approached institutional reform incidentally and made no\n            headway because there was little support for it: there was\n            little or no high-level commitment by government and the\n            three implementing agencies showed little or no inclination\n            to work together on policy reform. The decentralization of\n            land management presupposes that there is adequate\n            coordination between the sub-provincial agencies responsible\n            for surveying, mapping and zoning; because not all aspects\n            of land management can be self-financing, land management\n            may be compromised if transfers from central government are\n            erratic and insufficient. Despite the project's\n            investment in local government capacity building, the\n            National Land Agency was not sufficiently decentralized to\n            facilitate collaboration with local institutions, and survey\n            and mapping initiatives by these agencies were not\n            harmonized, reducing the efficiency of spatial planning.\n            This problem is aggravated by the underfunding of provincial\n            and local levels of government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Land Management and Policy\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Land Management and\n            Policy Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2014/03/19243430/indonesia-land-management-policy-development-project","projn":"5M-Mdf Publications -- P064278","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Banks & Banking Reform,Urban Housing,Public Sector Economics,Forestry","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Urban Development,Rural Development","count":"Middle East and North Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20140314112419"},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"(Historic)Economic management","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Urban Development,Rural Development","prdln":"External Training","seccl":"Public","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, accounting, actual cost,\n            Actual Costs, ADB, Agriculture, autonomy, budget\n            constraints, capitals, Communal land, communities,\n            consolidation, cost of capital, cultivated land,\n            decentralization, devolution, district governments, economic\n            analysis, economic growth, farmland, financial deepening,\n            Financial Management, forest, forest areas, forest estate,\n            forest land, Forestry, Forestry Law, forests, housing,\n            improved land, indigenous peoples, Institutional\n            Development, land acquisition, Land Acquisition Act, land\n            administration, land claims, land consolidation, land\n            distribution, Land legislation, LAND MANAGEMENT, land\n            markets, land parcels, Land Policy, land records, land\n            redistribution, Land Registration, land rights, land tenure,\n            land tenure security, land title, land titles, land titling,\n            land transactions, land use, land use planning, land users,\n            land value, land-use, land-use planning, landowner,\n            landowners, laws, legal framework, legal provisions,\n            legislation, Local Government, local governments, natural\n            resources, oil, peer review, private sector, productivity,\n            property rights, property value, Public, public\n            consultation, public infrastructure, Public Sector, public\n            spending, Regulatory Framework, roads, rural areas, sites,\n            Technical assistance, transparency, Treasury, trees,\n            villages, zoning"}},"owner":"Regional Integ. & Partnerships (MNARS)","repnb":"85809"},"facets":{}}}
