Ratings for the Eight-Ninth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project for Uganda were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Inadequate accounting of political economy factors in the\n            design of major reforms can adversely affect the design,\n            implementation and outcomes of DPOs. Lack of focus on\n            domestic revenue mobilization is a prime example. Pressures\n            to extend budget support within the broader, coordinated\n            donor support framework without hard conditionality to raise\n            domestic revenues can undermine incentives for domestic\n            revenue mobilization. This, in turn, can undercut\n            macroeconomic adjustment needed for sustainable fiscal\n            policy as well as the adequacy of funding for basic\n            services. Implementation and evaluation are frequently\n            undermined when objectives are not tightly linked to prior\n            actions and there is no measurable and relevant results\n            framework, when outcome indicators are ambiguous, and when\n            targets do not incorporate an explicit and convincing theory\n            of change. Achievement and sustainability of development\n            outcomes are facilitated by careful attention to political\n            economy dimensions, both at the design stage and when making\n            changes in a DPO series. For example, the failure to\n            increase revenue mobilization over a long period of time,\n            which was not addressed under the program, was directly\n            related to the political economy of political patronage and\n            large, entrenched tax exemptions and culture of\n            non-compliance. DPOs can show improvements in design and\n            outcomes when they actively use lessons from the past\n            operations as well as integrate important technical\n            knowledge products (such as CEMs and PERs). Such lessons can\n            also inform the Bank to take proactive, if difficult\n            measures such as the cancellation of an operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Fifth-Ninth Poverty

Intensive coordination\n            efforts with development partners paid off in terms of a\n            results framework that could be used for program tracking\n            and management.

           Poverty Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC 9) for Uganda\n            is to improved access to and greater value for money (VFM)\n            in, public services. This program document presents a credit\n            to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 65.2 million or US$100\n            million equivalent to finance the PRSC 9. It is the second\n            of three development policy operations (DPOs) to support\n            Uganda's National Development Plan (NDP) and covers the\n            period 2012-13. The PRSC 9 is prepared under the Joint\n            Budget Support Framework (JBSF). The operation will improve\n            efficiency in four service delivery sectors by addressing\n            common key binding implementation constraints in public\n            financial management (PFM), public service management and\n            public administration, in tandem with sector-specific\n            reforms within health, education, water and sanitation and\n            transport. The PRSC 9 builds upon reforms initiated under\n            the first (PRSC 8) operation of the series and provides the\n            foundation for further reforms supported under the final\n            operation of the series (PRSC 10). PRSC 9 focuses on two\n            policy clusters: 1) reforms in public expenditure\n            management, public financial management and public service\n            management that improve service delivery and 2) value for\n            money in public service delivery sectors. Measures supported\n            by the operation include: improved budget credibility; more\n            transparent and efficient public financial and sector\n            management, focusing on accountability and improved service\n            delivery systems at the local government level that should\n            lead to better quality of education and health services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Ninth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Ninth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit
