Some of the\n            quantitative targets of the loan, such as percentages of\n            allocations to regional development outside Dublin and of\n            loan funds to small-scale industrial projects, were not\n            fully achieved. However, flexibility on the part of the\n            Borrower and the Bank was justified in light of economic\n            developments. High unemployment in Dublin County caused the\n            development of industry there to continue to be a major\n            policy goal, which in turn forced the Government to change\n            its priorities in 1977. The groundwork undertaken during\n            this project supported the Borrower's financing of\n            small-scale enterprises and succeeded in meeting its\n            objective of employment generation. The Borrower's\n            financial performance was satisfactory and arrears are not a\n            major problem. This project was one of the last Bank\n            operations in Ireland. Along with the First Industrial\n            Credit Project, this project contributed to active and\n            worthwhile relationships between the Irish Government, the\n            Industrial Credit Company, Ltd. (ICC), and the Bank. The ICC\n            has developed into a mature and efficient institution thanks\n            in part to the Bank projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ireland - Second Industrial Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ireland - Second Industrial\n            Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/12/741710/ireland-second-industrial-credit-project","projn":"IE-Icc II (Dfc) -- P037401","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Municipal Financial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Ireland","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980203114345"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,agriculture,Balance\n            Sheet,Balance Sheets,Bank loans,banks,borrowing,capital\n            formation,capital loans,consolidation,cost savings,Current\n            Assets,debt,deposits,development agencies,development\n            banking,economic conditions,Economic Development,economic\n            impact,economists,EIB,employment,Equity Investments,Exchange\n            Rates,exports,Financial Performance,Fiscal Year,Foreign\n            Exchange,GNP,gross fixed capital formation,growth rate,high\n            unemployment,Income,Income\n            Statements,Inflation,insurance,interest rates,Loan\n            Commitments,Mergers,metals,migration,net\n            worth,oil,Portfolio,project\n            financing,reorganization,Retained\n            earnings,savings,Securities,subsidiaries,taxation,terms of\n            trade,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,agriculture,Balance\n            Sheet,Balance Sheets,Bank loans,banks,borrowing,capital\n            formation,capital loans,consolidation,cost savings,Current\n            Assets,debt,deposits,development agencies,development\n            banking,economic conditions,Economic Development,economic\n            impact,economists,EIB,employment,Equity Investments,Exchange\n            Rates,exports,Financial Performance,Fiscal Year,Foreign\n            Exchange,GNP,gross fixed capital formation,growth rate,high\n            unemployment,Income,Income\n            Statements,Inflation,insurance,interest rates,Loan\n            Commitments,Mergers,metals,migration,net\n            worth,oil,Portfolio,project\n            financing,reorganization,Retained\n            earnings,savings,Securities,subsidiaries,taxation,terms of\n            trade,working capital"}},"owner":"ECA Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"4809"},"724704":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1975/08/724704/ireland-second-industrial-credit-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1975/08/724704/ireland-second-industrial-credit-project","new_url":"1975/08/724704/ireland-second-industrial-credit-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/08/18/000178830_98101901374981/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/08/18/000178830_98101901374981/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"1160","datestored":"2000-08-18T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1975-08-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ireland - Second Industrial Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The loan will support a strengthening in\n            ICC's involvement in the promotion of regional\n            development and employment.
