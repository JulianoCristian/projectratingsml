The lessons learned\n            indicate that the Bank was aware that the new\n            Government's electoral platform was often at odds with\n            the reform agenda supported by Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (SAC3). So, the Bank was faced with the choice of pursuing\n            an adjustment operation, providing some budget support and\n            continuing to engage in order to limit the reform reversals,\n            or to disengage. It chose the former. It was the right\n            decision because more serious policy reversals almost\n            certainly would have occurred in the absence of SAC3. Tariff\n            re-balancing, though partially undermined, probably would\n            likely have been much delayed or not have taken place at\n            all. A hospital restructuring plan for the further\n            elimination of excess capacity in Chisinau Municipality\n            Hospital and Republican Hospitals might never have been\n            developed and the case against Union Fenosa might have\n            actually led to cancellation of the privatization contract.\n            Granting extensions can be costly to subsequent operations\n            if it sets a precedent for noncompliance. In the case of\n            Moldova, there was a mixture of delays and last minute\n            scrambling to implement. In the end, the Government came up\n            short in its implementation of second tranche conditions and\n            adherence to the LDP."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Third Structural

  maintaining liberal market policies in the agriculture\n            sector and further development of land and credit markets,\n            securing the financial viability of the power sector by\n
