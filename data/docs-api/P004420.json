Rice Processing and Storage Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This is a project completion report of\n            the Rice Processing and Storage Project in Philippines. The\n            objective of the project is to assist the Government of the\n            Philippines in carrying out a program of modernization of\n            Philippines processing industry. The project is intended to\n            add to the country's milling capacity, to reduce grain\n            spoilage, and to increase the efficiency of grain\n            processing. The need for improvement in grain processing and\n            marketing has long been recognized. Although most or the\n            processing and storage facilities are in need of repair,\n            replacement or modernization, private investment in this\n            sector has been hindered by lack of credit on suitable terms\n            and inadequate training of plant operators. The scope for\n            investment in modern facilities in this sector was limited\n            until the mid-1960's, when new nigh yielding varieties\n            were introduced. As originally conceived the project was to\n            finance new construction of six large and 30 smaller\n            integrated modern rice processing plants, and modernization\n            of 30 existing mills. These mills then would have a combined\n            capacity of mechanically drying 225 tons per hour, milling\n            60 tons of paddies per hour, bulk storing about 150,000 tons\n            (static), and sack storing a further 24,000 tons. The\n            project provides funds to be relent through the Development\n            Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to private millers and\n            traders. Sub-loans to beneficiaries carry 12 percent annual\n            interest and run for 14 years, including about one\n            year's grace. Estimated total project cost was $21.0\n            million, including contingencies, of which $14.3 million (68\n            percent) will be provided by the Bank, $2.2 million (11\n            percent) by DBP, and $4.4 million (21 percent) by the beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Rice Processing and Storage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Rice Processing and\n            Storage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1974/03/1560397/philippines-rice-processing-storage-project","projn":"PH-Rice Processing -- P004420","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Nutrition,Food & Beverage Industry,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810191257427"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Administrative Costs,agricultural\n            development,Agriculture,bran,by-products,cooperatives,Corn,crop,crops,drY\n            season,farm,farmers,fertilizer,foreign exchange,Grain,grain\n            processing,Grain Storage,grains,gross sales,high yielding\n            varieties,Income Statements,International Rice Research\n            Institute,IRRI,irrigation,local government,local\n            governments,milling industry,operating\n            costs,Paddy,population growth,private commercial\n            banks,ra,return on equity,return on investment,Rice,rice\n            milling,rice mills,rice price,Rice Processing,rice\n            production,Rice\n            Research,rubber,Subsidiary,transport,UNDP,United\n            Nations,United Nations Development Programme,water\n            supply,working capital,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"Administrative Costs,agricultural\n            development,Agriculture,bran,by-products,cooperatives,Corn,crop,crops,drY\n            season,farm,farmers,fertilizer,foreign exchange,Grain,grain\n            processing,Grain Storage,grains,gross sales,high yielding\n            varieties,Income Statements,International Rice Research\n            Institute,IRRI,irrigation,local government,local\n            governments,milling industry,operating\n            costs,Paddy,population growth,private commercial\n            banks,ra,return on equity,return on investment,Rice,rice\n            milling,rice mills,rice price,Rice Processing,rice\n            production,Rice\n            Research,rubber,Subsidiary,transport,UNDP,United\n            Nations,United Nations Development Programme,water\n            supply,working capital,yields"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"379"},"722536":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1971/01/722536/philippines-rice-processing-storage-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1971/01/722536/philippines-rice-processing-storage-project","new_url":"1971/01/722536/philippines-rice-processing-storage-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/17/000178830_98101903201122/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/17/000178830_98101903201122/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"0720","datestored":"2000-11-17T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1971-01-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Rice Processing and Storage Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The proposed project would provide\n            long-term credit to the private sector for setting up modern\n            integrated rice processing units in major producing areas.\n            Processing capacity created by the project is expected to be\n            distributed among 6 large units and 60 small units.
