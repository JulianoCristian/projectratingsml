Lessons drawn from the\n            project are conveyed as follows. The risk of a reemerging\n            war remains a dominating factor when assessing a project in\n            a post-conflict country. Thus particularly, in the financial\n            sector, economic instability, uncertainty, and high\n            inflation are factors to be previously assessed, as well as\n            the potential delays of necessary reforms to be introduced.\n            However, a strong element of the project was the commitment,\n            and stability of the implementing agency, which despite the\n            absence of Bank visits, changes among team leaders, and\n            Government officials, maintained its position throughout\n            implementation, thus ensuring institutional memory, and\n            preventing an early project closing. The long duration of\n            the project (ten years) proved that ambitious goals under\n            difficult circumstances, and in a country under economic\n            transition, may require more implementation time than\n            initially planned. And, technical assistance projects allows\n            the Bank to remain engaged in the policy dialogue, beyond\n            the immediate project objectives, while Bank project ratings\n            can be used effectively as a tool in supervision, given that\n            project performance was discussed with the Government, which\n            in addition, helped accelerate critical government actions,\n            ensuring project outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - Financial Institutions\n            Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Angola - Financial

the central bank so that it can perform its monetary policy\n            and regulatory functions; (ii) developing banking\n            infrastructure; (iii) improving the legal and regulatory\n            environment for financial operations; and (iv) establishing\n            institutional mechanisms for financing private investment.\n            The project will consist of: (a) strengthening the National\n            Bank of Angola, the central bank, principally through\n            improvements in its accounts and accounting practices,\n            procedures and information systems, and in its staff skills\n            in administrative and functional areas; (b) development of\n            banking infrastructure, including establishment of a\n            national check clearing system, a training center for\n            financial sector personnel, and training a core of financial\n            professionals; (c) disseminating and implementing laws and\n            regulations affecting the banking sector, ensuring their\n            coherence, establishing the legal and regulatory framework\n            for the insurance sector; and establishing accounting and\n            auditing standards for the enterprise sector; and (d)\n            improving institutional mechanisms for financing private\n            investment and studies on access to credit by the private
