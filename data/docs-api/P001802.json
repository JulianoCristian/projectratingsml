The key lessons\n            specify the arduous process in developing genuine ownership,\n            particularly in light of dramatic shifts in business\n            practices, and political strategies. It reflects the complex\n            privatization process, for, although divestiture of the\n            Government's involvement in the management, and\n            operation of the corridor facilities was the main objective,\n            there was no clear indication of project ownership at the\n            onset of the operation, since most government officials were\n            reluctant about privatization of corridor facilities.\n            However, the project proved to be an effective tool in the\n            establishment of a continuous, and positive dialogue between\n            the Bank, and the Borrower, conducive, finally to the\n            government's full commitment. This dialogue became\n            successful following the establishment of a High-Level\n            Committee, with the appropriate decision-making power, which\n            proved critical in accelerating, particularly, the complex\n            concessioning process, and, further achieved the project\n            objectives. In addition, it is suggested that, to initiate\n            the concessioning, or privatization process of complex\n            railway or port systems, the use of one, or two components\n            should be enough, for its lessons allow effective\n            improvements to the process further on."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Maputo Corridor Revitalization\n            Technical
