Some lessons\n            learned included: implementing a community based project\n            through a local government system that has been recently\n            introduced needs sustained commitment at all levels and a\n            major emphasis on institutional and behavioral change. As a\n            high risk approach, sufficient resources are required to\n            support institutional development and high level champions\n            are needed to maintain commitment and progress. There is a\n            need to review the evolving local government system in the\n            province and prepare approaches for rural development\n            projects that are community based with effective support\n            from government in partnership with civil society\n            organizations. Implementing community projects in\n            environments that are highly insecure need to have a\n            flexible design and use locally trusted organizations. The\n            security situation in the province deteriorated rapidly\n            since the predecessor project making it difficult for the\n            government agency to implement and for the World Bank to\n            provide implementation support. The design needs to be\n            flexible to allow changes in approach, ways of working and\n            expected outcomes. Recovery of the outstanding advance\n            should be started at an early stage to avoid problems such\n            as the exchange losses. Bank staff should closely monitor\n            the available balance in the DA in both currencies i.e. PAK\n            and or US Dollars. A rural development project that requires\n            field work with staff inputs from local governments needs to\n            provide appropriate logistical support. Local governments\n            often face budget and mobility issues, and if appropriate\n            support in the form of financial support and vehicles is not\n            provided by the project, they need to mobilize resources\n            from their own alternative sources. Preparation of new\n            budget item for local governments to procure a new vehicle\n            can require a long period of time and would not easily be\n            approved. However, in order to implement effectively a rural\n            project that requires frequent field visits, it is important\n            to carry out an assessment of staff mobility and constraints\n            of local government bodies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second North West Frontier\n            Province (NWFP) Community Infrastructure

Pakistan has borne the brunt of the earthquake,\n            especially 5 northeastern districts of the North West\n            Frontier Province (NWFP) and three districts covering most\n            of had Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with enormous loss of life\n            and devastation of infrastructure and property.  The Bank is\n            preparing a proposed package of US$ 470 million to help\n            Pakistan deal with the reconstruction effort and safeguard\n            the on-going reform and poverty reduction program, which\n            will include supplemental financing of US$ 150 million under\n            the Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSC 1) and of US$ 50\n            million under the Second Structural Adjustment Credit for\n            the North West Frontier Province (NWFP SAC 2). This report\n            covers the proposed Supplemental Financing of US$ 50\n            million, which will support the sustained implementation of\n            the NWFP SAC2 reform program, and help finance part of the\n            gap in resources incurred as a result of the earthquake. The\n            NWFP SAC 2 is the second in a series of three operations to\n            support the implementation of the Government of NWFP's\n            Provincial Reform Program. The NWFP SAC 2 has been\n            supporting implementation of the provincial\n            government's reform program, and is based on five\n            pillars: (1) Accelerating economic growth and promoting\n            private sector development; (2) Accelerating human\n            development and improving social service delivery; (3)\n            Fiscal reforms; (4) Governance reforms in public financial\n            management and procurement; and (5) Reforms to achieve an\n            efficient, accountable, and service oriented civil service.\n            It is critical that the provincial fiscal framework remains\n            sustainable while relief and rehabilitation takes place.\n            Supplemental program support will be an important source of\n            budget financing for the Government as it will provide\n            financing at a time when the impact of the disaster on\n            government revenues is unknown; and there is an urgent need\n            for additional government expenditure. Supplemental\n            financing for NWFP SAC 2 will thus complement the support\n            for short term medium-term rehabilitation that will be\n            provided through the restructuring and reprogramming of\n            ongoing operations in the Bank's portfolio. It will\n            also complement the assistance provided by other\n            multilateral, in particular the ADB, and bilateral agencies.\n            Finally, the Supplemental Financing will contribute to\n            minimizing the risks to the overall reform program, maintain\n            the integrity of the transition to, and the preparation of,\n            the follow up operation-the first NWFP Development Policy Credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Structural Adjustment\n            Credit for the North West Frontier Province Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Structural\n            Adjustment Credit for the North West Frontier Province Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/10/6361291/pakistan-second-structural-adjustment-credit-north-west-frontier-province-project","projn":"PK-Nwfp Community Infrastructure  Project\n            II ( Nwfp Cip2) -- P082621,PK-Nwfp Sac II -- P079635","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Poverty Assessment,Public Sector Regulation,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20051021122651"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Education for all,Health system performance,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Regulation and competition policy,Urban services and housing for the poor,Municipal governance and institution building,Participation and civic engagement,Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Power,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Health,General public administration sector,General industry and trade sector,General education sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Energy and mining,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, accounting, ADB, Auditing,\n            autonomy, cash transfers, civil service, clean water,\n            clinics, Currency unit, current expenditures, debt,\n            development partners, Development Policy, devolution,\n            disposable income, drought, economic activities, economic\n            activity, economic growth, Economic Management, education,\n            employment, Expenditure Survey, families, Farm Water,\n            financial data, financial management, financial support,\n            Fiscal deficits, FUNDS FLOW, growth rate, health, health\n            indicators, health services, hospitals, Household Income,\n            Household Survey, housing, human development, Human Resource\n            Management, income poverty, increased emphasis, inflation,\n            laws, legislation, Living Standards, Living Standards\n            Measurement, local administration, local governments, local\n            levels, local officials, macroeconomic crisis, macroeconomic\n            stability, medicines, national level, national levels, Needs\n            Assessment, nurses, paramedics, patients, pensions, Poverty\n            Alleviation, poverty estimates, poverty incidence, Poverty\n            Reduction, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper, primary schools, priority areas, public\n            expenditures, public sector, Reducing Poverty, remote areas,\n            remote communities, revenue sources, rural, rural areas,\n            sanitation, service delivery, social indicators, social\n            infrastructure, social spending, STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT,\n            structural reforms, tax administration, tax reform,\n            technical assistance, transport, urban areas, victims,\n            wages, water supply, Welfare Indicators"}},"owner":"Econ.

The project will be open to all participating\n            tehsil municipal administration (TMA) units that have\n            demonstrated their capacity to manage the program, and\n            within these to all communities, taking into account the\n            readiness of residents to participate, the level of poverty,\n            and current access to basic infrastructure. The main\n            objective of the project is to promote the well being of low\n            income communities of NWFP by: (a) supporting investments in\n            community development activities, basic services, and small\n            scale productive infrastructure; and, (b) strengthening\n            capacity at the new devolved local government and community\n            levels, to plan and deliver such services and\n            infrastructure. The project's three main components\n            are: 1) local infrastructure and  services, involving\n            support to participating Citizen Community boards (CCBs),\n            and TMAs sub-project investments in small scale, and\n            productive infrastructure projects; 2) improving local level\n            performance, through two distinct sub-components:\n            institutional strengthening, and community development\n            activities; and, 3) implementation support, monitoring and\n            evaluation, through a) technical assistance, mostly local\n            and regional, for capacity building and training, to improve\n            local capacity, particularly at the tehsil level; and, b)\n            implementation support to the Local Government Election and\n            Rural Development Department (LG&RDD) to improve overall\n            administration and coordination, including supervision,\n            monitoring and impact

North West\n            Frontier Province - NWFP - Community Infrastructure Project\n            (CIPII), and evaluates social and institutional\n            organizations, including institutional arrangements under\n            devolution, examines gender status, reviews the First CIP\n            components, and proposes monitoring and evaluation to be\n            pursued, within a consultation framework, based on the\n            assessment of social safeguards, and critical risks. The\n            consultation process involved a wide participation of\n            stakeholders, local communities, existing Citizen's\n            Community Boards (CCBs) and nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs), as well as the private sector, and government\n            agencies. This process fostered an approach that involves\n            local communities to devise practical solutions, through\n            CCBs in a community action planning process, based on human,\n            financial, and operation and maintenance commitments, to\n            integrate physical, social, and economic components with the\n            leadership of the CCB. The role of women should be\n            incorporated, and strengthened in all aspects of the\n            program. To this end, support will be provided through\n            training assistance, and institutional capacity building,\n            and in addition, focused groups discussions among the\n            community members shall address the needs and requirements\n            to improve infrastructure, for appropriate financial\n            management, and, to continue a traditional contribution of\n            voluntary land donation for public benefit. Water quality,\n            waste disposal, overgrazing and deforestation are concerns\n            that will be monitored through water conservation practices\n            (and water rationing if needed), waste management, and\n            community involvement. Moreover, infrastructure development,\n            particularly water supply and roads, shall contribute to\n            poverty alleviation, by providing income generation\n            activities, while improvement of health facilities,\n            especially preventive practices, would be cost-saving instruments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second NWFP Community\n
