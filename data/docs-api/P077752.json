Some lessons\n            learned included:  performance indicator design needs to\n            receive careful attention at project appraisal to avoid\n            difficulties during implementation. They need to be focused\n            on the key outcomes of the development objective, and\n            limited in number; indicators need to be clear and\n            measurable; and explanatory notes should be provided where\n            necessary, to explain the intent and method of measurement.\n            Experience from the project shows the wisdom of not\n            subjecting newly created government-owned companies with no\n            financial autonomy, to loan obligations or covenants they\n            are not able to comply with. While such requirements may be\n            more appropriate for the established water supply sector,\n            they are highly challenging for new wastewater and solid\n            waste sectors which are still developing. Newly set up\n            companies in these sectors do not have an independent\n            revenue stream and are fully dependent on government\n            subsidies. The Bank needs to make realistic assessments of\n            growth for establishment of supply-driven economic\n            development zones. China has a number of highly successful\n            economic development zones established under the right\n            conditions. However, EDZs established without the right\n            underlying economic drivers, have slow starts or are not\n            successful. Such was the case in Qixia where wastewater\n            investments were planned on the basis of weak assessments of growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Shandong Environment
