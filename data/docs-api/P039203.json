Lessons learned\n            included: 1) The impact of funding constraints and fiscal\n            policies should not be underestimated. The lack of fiscal\n            space and/or counterpart funding remains a major risk for\n            fiscally constrained countries; 2) Multiple operations\n            contribute to additional flexibility and long-term\n            sustainability of investment; 3) A multimodal transport\n            project can maximize the development impact but requires\n            flexibility during supervision; 4) Maintaining a strong\n            policy dialogue during supervision can significantly support\n            reforms. This project gave another example of the difficulty\n            of reforming railways, even if all the possible support was\n            assured during preparation; and 5) The design of\n            institutional arrangements and forms of private\n            participation should be adapted to the country's\n            specificities. The concession of operation of forest\n            products in the State Railway Administration (AFE) did not\n            occur despite the need to improve its efficiency and strong\n            initial support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay -
