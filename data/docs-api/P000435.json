Some of the salient lessons were these: 1)\n            Continuity in dialogue. When a Government is receptive to in\n            depth discussion on development and sector policies, a long\n            implementation period of a project may promote continuity\n            and trust in Borrower and Bank relationship and prevent\n            disruption in dialogue. 2) Transition in team leadership.\n            Changes in Bank team leadership during project\n            implementation require careful management of transition to\n            ensure evolution rather than shift in dialogue. 3) Public\n            sector crowding out. The full impact of subsidized\n            government agencies crowding out the private sector\n            development is difficult to appreciate at the beginning of a\n            privatization program. Inter-island maritime transport\n            turned out to be more feasible than expected originally as\n            the government subsidized company began to withdraw from the market."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Transport and Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cape Verde - Transport and\n            Infrastructure Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5542033/cape-verde-transport-infrastructure-project","projn":"CV-Transport And Infrastructure Project -- P000435","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Ports & Waterways,Banks & Banking Reform,Roads & Highways,National Governance,Transport Security","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Governance","count":"Cabo Verde","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050111165626"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways,Ports, waterways and shipping","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Governance","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB, alcohol, Bank Performance, Bank\n            procedures, Bank supervision, bidding, bottlenecks, capital\n            stock, civil servants, competitive advantage, concessions,\n            deceleration, drivers, driving, driving schools, Economic\n            Development, EIB, elections, employment, erosion, financial\n            management, FISCAL YEAR, foreign exchange, framework, fuel,\n            heavy equipment, highways, Impact Indicators, Institutional\n            Development, insurance, Internal Rate of Return,\n            international competitiveness, intervention, inventory,\n            legal framework, Lessons Learned, local contractors, local\n            populations, management information systems, municipalities,\n            parking, partnership, passenger, pavement, PCD, PCU,\n            Petroleum, Ports, private sector, Privatization,\n            procurement, productivity, profitability, project\n            implementation, Project Preparation, Public expenditure,\n            public sector, reorganization, resource allocation, road\n            construction, road infrastructure, road legislation, road\n            maintenance, road management, road networks, road planning,\n            Road rehabilitation, road safety, road system, Road\n            Transport, Roads, routes, routine maintenance, runways,\n            safety belts, safety campaigns, sand, structures,\n            Subsidiary, taxis, Technical Assistance, terrain, traffic,\n            TRANSPORT, transport planning, Transportation, trucks,\n            vehicle inspection, vehicles, workers"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF021352-C.
