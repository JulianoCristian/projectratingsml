Some lessons learned\n            included: for complicated works that are new to a country or\n            sector, robust background analysis is crucial to a\n            high-quality outcome, and can require a feasibility analysis\n            as part of a separate project. A combination of structural\n            and non-structural measures is a necessary but challenging\n            feature of integrated flood management projects, which\n            requires specific implementation arrangements to incentivize\n            the prioritization of both dimensions. Approaches to\n            providing cost contingencies should be tailored to specific\n            economic and project contexts. Restructuring should be\n            proactively used during implementation to address weaknesses\n            in the results framework, particularly addressing weak or\n            poorly designed indicators. Pre-emptive action should be\n            taken by project teams to identify potential for\n            institutional friction between local and national government\n            levels, which should be addressed prior to approval to\n            minimize consequences on implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
