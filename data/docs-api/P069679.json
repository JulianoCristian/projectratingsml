Some lessons learned included:\n            restructure projects when needed, especially when moving\n            from Technical Assistance (TA) to an investment project and\n            when parallel financing is mobilized so that each project\n            could be evaluated on its own merits and so that the\n            Government resources will not be wasted on undisbursed\n            funds. The PPIBL was not restructured to reflect the de\n            facto significantly changed Project Development Objective\n            (PDO), project financing, as well as expenditure category\n            and component cost allocations. This made the PPIBL funds\n            initially redundant; it led to disbursement delays as the\n            Government of Romania (GoR) preferred to withdraw the\n            existing grant and loan funds before or instead of the\n            PPIBL; and it made the GoR pay commitment fees for\n            unutilized funds until 2005. It also complicated the project\n            evaluation that needed to cover all the sources of funding\n            and made it somewhat artificial as no clear accountability\n            lines were drawn between the Bank-related sources of funding\n            since they were managed as a pool of funds. The GoR\n            maintained an experienced and sufficiently staffed Project\n            Management Unit (PMU) throughout the project life and\n            established a high level Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL)\n            PMU to monitor the preparation and implementation of the PAL\n            reform progress in 2004-2006. The location of the PAL PMU\n            and the cooperation between the PMU provided the required\n            leverage to launch and expedite the project implementation\n            because many of the beneficiary agencies had limited\n            institutional capacity and readiness to embark in the reform\n            program; they had limited or even absent experience with\n            Bank's projects; and there was a need for coordinated\n            intergovernmental efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Private and Public Sector\n            Institution Building Loan

The third component provides\n            technical assistance for the divestiture of key enterprises\n            in the oil, gas, and electricity/power sectors, including\n            majority or strategic sales under market conditions. The\n            fourth component supports an improved business environment\n            and covers training of judges and court personnel,\n            procurement of court equipment, refurbishing works, and a\n            public awareness campaign.
