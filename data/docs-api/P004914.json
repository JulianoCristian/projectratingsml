This operation was the first in the\n            sector after an 8 year hiatus. Previous operations supported\n            the creation of technician and engineering training\n            capacity, technical secondary schools and various\n            institutes, like the Institute for the Promotion of In-\n            Service Training. By the time the project went to the Board,\n            all 5 previous projects had been closed, 4 Project\n            Completion Reports were available, and 1 Completion Report\n            was under preparation. Major lessons learned from past\n            lending included: (i) assigning administration of a project\n            to a single entity to ensure efficiency during\n            implementation; and (ii) providing training for\n            decentralization of project responsibilities. The Staff\n            Appraisal Report, dated May 26, 1988, stated the project\n            objectives as follows: (a) to upgrade the network of\n            existing training institutions; (b) to improve the quality\n            of vocational training programs and enhance their relevance\n            to labor market needs; and (c) to strengthen the management\n            of the system, control costs and improve financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Vocational Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Vocational Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/01/732104/algeria-vocational-training-project","projn":"DZ-Voc.
