Lessons learned are the following: Private\n            sector involvement through leasing arrangements, was to have\n            been an important project vehicle for improving the\n            efficiency of plantation management. However, at appraisal\n            the government sought to maintain the status quo and argued\n            that leasing was not an option, with the result that no\n            improvements in efficiency or in the financial viability of\n            industrial plantations were likely. 2) The failure to engage\n            the primary stakeholders in the timber industry during\n            implementation was one of the project's more\n            significant failings. 3) Steps leading to substantive\n            institutional and legal reform should have been clearly\n            articulated earlier, rather than in the final year of\n            project implementation. 4) A well focused and purposeful\n            training program, extended to diverse groups of staff, made\n            a significant contribution to improve technical operations\n            and management, but these improvements needed an apt\n            enabling institutional, legal, and policy framework. 5)\n            Placing task management responsibilities in the Resident\n            Mission posed additional challenges; regular oversight may\n            result in less frequent \"formal\" supervision\n            reporting, and an over-optimistic assessment of project\n            progress. Issues concerning governance, institutional\n            sustainability, and expenditure management must be addressed more."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Forestry Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Forestry Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/01/728065/kenya-forestry-development-project","projn":"KE-Forest Development -- P001322","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Wetlands,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99031910565042"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Agricultural extension and research,Forestry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"commercial forestry,crop\n            production,crops,cultivation,Environmental\n            Conservation,environmental\n            policy,eucalyptus,expenditures,farm forestry,farm forestry\n            extension,fisheries,Forest,forest conservation,Forest\n            Department,forest estate,forest industry,Forest\n            infrastructure,forest inventory,forest land,forest\n            lands,forest management,Forest Officer,forest\n            operations,forest plantations,Forest Policy,forest\n            resources,forest roads,Forestry,Forestry Department,Forestry\n            Development,forestry education,Forestry Policy,forestry\n            research,forestry sector,forestry\n            subsector,fuelwood,inflation,innovation,institutional\n            change,inventories,labor productivity,Natural\n            Resource,Natural Resource Management,Natural Resources,Paper\n            Mills,Plantation,planting,private sector,public\n            sector,pulp,pulp and paper\n            industry,pulpwood,roundwood,sawlogs,SAWMILLING,timber,timber\n            industry,timber production,tree\n            planting,wages,wildlife,wood,wood production"},"1":{"cdata!":"commercial forestry,crop\n            production,crops,cultivation,Environmental\n            Conservation,environmental\n            policy,eucalyptus,expenditures,farm forestry,farm forestry\n            extension,fisheries,Forest,forest conservation,Forest\n            Department,forest estate,forest industry,Forest\n            infrastructure,forest inventory,forest land,forest\n            lands,forest management,Forest Officer,forest\n            operations,forest plantations,Forest Policy,forest\n            resources,forest roads,Forestry,Forestry Department,Forestry\n            Development,forestry education,Forestry Policy,forestry\n            research,forestry sector,forestry\n            subsector,fuelwood,inflation,innovation,institutional\n            change,inventories,labor productivity,Natural\n            Resource,Natural Resource Management,Natural Resources,Paper\n            Mills,Plantation,planting,private sector,public\n            sector,pulp,pulp and paper\n            industry,pulpwood,roundwood,sawlogs,SAWMILLING,timber,timber\n            industry,timber production,tree\n            planting,wages,wildlife,wood,wood production"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF035370-KENYA - ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECT","repnb":"18805"},"736240":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/11/736240/kenya-forestry-development-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/11/736240/kenya-forestry-development-project","new_url":"1991/11/736240/kenya-forestry-development-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/11/19/000009265_3960929180431/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/11/19/000009265_3960929180431/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"2198","docdt":"1991-11-19T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1991-11-19T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Forestry Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project's main objectives are:\n            (a) to enhance conservation and protection of indigenous\n            forest resources;
