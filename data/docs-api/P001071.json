The\n            project achieved most of its objectives, institutional\n            development has been partially achieved, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of the Bank was satisfactory\n            while the Borrower's was deficient. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, adequate linkages,\n            exchanges, and contacts are very important to ensure that\n            studies and surveys lead to policy formulation. Second,\n            simply subcontracting studies to foreign consultants,\n            because of a lack of local capacity and in the interest of\n            having the studies done within a reasonable time, does not\n            build any capacity in government departments. Third, social\n            funds are more likely to achieve their objectives when they\n            have greater independence from the Government. Fourth,\n            community involvement and support in the design,\n            implementation, and management of sub-projects to be\n            financed by social funds are very important to ensure the\n            success of social funds. Fifth, in order for a social fund\n            to start operations and finance sub-projects quickly, a\n            number of conditions must be met, such as the various\n            instruments needed for operations must be available.\n            Finally, mixing credits and grants makes the management and\n            operation of social funds particularly difficult and risky."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Socio-economic Development Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Socio-economic\n            Development Support

government to develop a long term program for\n            alleviating poverty in Guinea as a complement to the growth\n            promoting objectives of the structural adjustment program.\n            Three components constitute the core of the program. First,\n            there is social policy planning. The project will support\n            the strengthening of the Human Resources and Social Policy\n            Division (DHRPS). The DHRPS will be responsible for carrying\n            out studies on important issues of social policy and\n            integrating the results of these studies, and the results of\n            the household survey, into the design of social policy and\n            of the adjustment program. The second component involves\n            monitoring living standards. The Direction Nationale de la\n            Statistique et de l'Information will be strengthened by\n            the creation of a new Survey and Price Indices Division\n            which will organize and implement a permanent household\n            survey to track the evolution of living standards through\n            the adjustment process. The third component is the creation\n            of a pilot program of sub-projects for socio-economic\n            development. This program will be managed by a new Pilot\n            Project Unit.
