Lessons convey that overall development\n            impact is attained by a sustained support: the decision to\n            allocate the financial resources in two main sectors of a\n            province for a rather long period of time, benefited all\n            five districts of the provinces, and helped strengthen the\n            institutional capacity at the central and provincial\n            government levels. Moreover, the Bank's sustained\n            involvement, and support to the province contributed to\n            developing a strong working relationship with the local\n            authorities, attracting further donors to the province.\n            Although integrated provincial development projects are\n            effective means to strengthen decentralization, the\n            insufficient transfer of resources from central government\n            however, limited mobilization of local revenues, resulting\n            in inefficient allocation of resources across, and within\n            the road, water and sanitation sectors. Thus, concrete steps\n            need to be taken to increase the transparency of the funds\n            being transferred, to improve reliability of transfers in\n            terms of timing and amount, and, to enhance planning and\n            decision making capacity at the provincial level.\n            Implementation arrangements should be responsive to the\n            sectors characteristics and needs, since as in this project,\n            central, and provincial governments were not satisfied with\n            the implementation arrangements, and did not see the\n            relevance on the project coordination unit, nor the\n            technical assistance provided by foreign consultants. The\n            government proposed, and the Bank agreed, that the line\n            units of the provincial office would carry out all\n            implementation activities, institutional adjustments that\n            improved management, and inter sector coordination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Laos - Luang Namtha Provincial Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Laos - Luang Namtha Provincial\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2412419/laos-luang-namtha-provincial-development-project","projn":"LA-Luang Namtha -- P004207","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Health Economics & Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20030707113503"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Water supply,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,capacity\n            building,central government,clean water,clean water\n            supply,clinics,commodities,Competitive\n            Bidding,Construction,cost savings,decision\n            making,depreciation costs,distribution system,economic\n            analysis,Environmental Health,gravel,ground water,health\n            needs,households,hygiene education,income,Investment\n            Program,laundry,local communities,local partners,maintenance\n            activities,maintenance of water,National Water\n            Supply,project management,provincial government,provincial\n            governments,pumping,pumping station,pumps,reticulation,Rural\n            Water,Rural Water Supply,sand,Sanitary facilities,sanitation\n            component,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            services,sanitation systems,small towns,social\n            services,spring,town,towns,urban centers,Urban Water,Urban\n            Water Supply,washing,water distribution,water distribution\n            system,water quality,Water resource,Water resource\n            management,water service,water supply management,Water\n            supply services,Water Supply System,water supply\n            systems,water systems,water tariffs,water treatment,water\n            treatment plant,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,capacity\n            building,central government,clean water,clean water\n            supply,clinics,commodities,Competitive\n            Bidding,Construction,cost savings,decision\n            making,depreciation costs,distribution system,economic\n            analysis,Environmental Health,gravel,ground water,health\n            needs,households,hygiene education,income,Investment\n            Program,laundry,local communities,local partners,maintenance\n            activities,maintenance of water,National Water\n            Supply,project management,provincial government,provincial\n            governments,pumping,pumping station,pumps,reticulation,Rural\n            Water,Rural Water Supply,sand,Sanitary facilities,sanitation\n            component,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            services,sanitation systems,small towns,social\n            services,spring,town,towns,urban centers,Urban Water,Urban\n            Water Supply,washing,water distribution,water distribution\n            system,water quality,Water resource,Water resource\n            management,water service,water supply management,Water\n            supply services,Water Supply System,water supply\n            systems,water systems,water tariffs,water treatment,water\n            treatment plant,wells"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020761-AUSTRALIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST\n            FUND (USD),TF021368-LUANG NAMTHA PROVINCIAL DEVELOPMENT,TF031137-LAO PDR - RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE,TF031344-LAOS - LUANG NAMTHA PROVINCIAL\n            DEV.
