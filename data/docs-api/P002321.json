The overall outcome of the\n            project was satisfactory, and the performance of the Bank\n            and the borrower was also rated satisfactory. The long-term\n            objective of the project was to support improvements to\n            Senegal's economic performance by stimulating public\n            savings and improving the efficiency of public entities\n            responsible for the provision and maintenance of urban\n            services and housing. The short-term objectives involved (i)\n            allocation of scarce public resources to urban areas,\n            through efficient investment planning; and (ii) formulation\n            of an urban development and housing policy based on the\n            appropriate utilization of those resources. The main lessons\n            to be learned from the project are as follows: (a) Ongoing\n            and regular supervision are apparently both key to the\n            success of a project in a sensitive sector. (b) As regards\n            the resolution of matters linked-to policy and the\n            formulation of basic approaches, more realistic timeframes\n            should be planned, as early as the identification phase. (c)\n            The multi sectoral dimension of certain projects and large\n            number of parties involved require procedures and regular\n            assessments based on prior contractual commitments and\n            sanctioned by the gradual disbursement of credit proceeds.\n            (d) In order to avoid any risk of misunderstanding or\n            overlapping of jurisdiction, the use of a team approach to\n            management must be accompanied by preliminary in-depth\n            consultations that result in terms of reference detailing\n            the prerogatives of each party. (e) As early as the\n            identification phase, the technical executing agencies must\n            be involved in project formulation. To that end, they must\n            strengthen their design capability and streamline\n            administrative procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Urban Management and\n            Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Urban Management and\n            Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/12/736720/senegal-urban-management-rehabilitation-technical-assistance-project","projn":"SN-T.A.
