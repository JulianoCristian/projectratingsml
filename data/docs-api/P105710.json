Some of the key\n            lessons learned include: strategic plans need to be\n            translated into clear action plans, which include\n            monitorable output indicators to track progress. Governments\n            might be reluctant to invest the needed time to develop such\n            action plans, particularly given the short time-frame that\n            most governments in the Latin American region face due to\n            election laws. However, experience has repeatedly shown that\n            the lack of coordination and prioritization leads to\n            inefficiencies in implementation, and slows down reform\n            implementation. Several government agencies expressed regret\n            of not having invested more time and energy into developing\n            a solid monitoring and evaluation framework. In the absence\n            of such information, there is only limited evidence to argue\n            for sustained funding and support, which makes agencies more\n            vulnerable to political shifts. Additionally, the government\n            loses an opportunity to 'market' achieved results,\n            and use the data to convince other stakeholders and involved\n            agencies of the need for reform. Available BB funds can\n            provide the needed flexibility to react to government\n            request, and maintain a close dialogue with the government\n            on selected areas of interest. While funding through a\n            technical assistance loan was available to help implement\n            some of the reforms, those funds usually are not flexible\n            enough to cover \"quick turnaround\" analysis, and\n            ongoing knowledge building support. The provision of\n            additional Bank budget funds did allow several Bank experts\n            to maintain a close contact with the government and to\n            provide targeted short-term support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - First and Second Competitiveness\n            and Public Financial Management Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - First

two\n            Development Policy Loans (DPLs), which build upon the Public\n            Finance and Institutional DPL included in the previous Bank\n            interim country strategy, intended to support the\n            Government's development program as described in its\n            Strategic Vision document. Within this framework, this DPL\n            series focuses on actions aimed at: 1) Promoting broad-based\n            growth through the enhancement of private sector\n            competitiveness, by reducing bureaucratic red tape,\n            improving training policies, and increasing investments in\n            innovation; and 2) Consolidating fiscal sustainability,\n            transparency and efficiency through the modernization of\n            public financial management systems for revenue, debt,\n            fiscal reporting, and public procurement. The actions\n            supported by the DPL series are expected to enhance private\n            sector competitiveness and public financial management, with\n            a view of improving public sector efficiency and\n            effectiveness in a fiscally sustainable fashion, thus\n            influencing the country's enabling environment for\n            private sector development. The DPL series will also\n            contribute to fiscal stabilization and efficient spending by\n            helping diversify external sources of finance and obtain\n            better financial terms. This DPL program takes into account\n            potential risks in three areas: economic, political and\n            institutional strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - First Competitiveness and
