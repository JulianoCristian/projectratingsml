Some lessons learned included: health sector\n            reform is complex and long-term in nature. It is becoming\n            increasingly recognized that the objectives of the health\n            sector reforms envisaged in the mid 90's were overly\n            ambitious and could not possibly be achieved in the life of\n            a five-year project. A more incremental approach with a\n            clear roadmap and benchmarks may be more practical.\n            Government commitment is necessary but not sufficient for\n            engaging in a health sector reform program. Despite\n            Government commitment, it took a long period for actions to\n            materialize because of weak institutional capacity to carry\n            out the reforms, which was coupled with an acute shortage of\n            adequately qualified personnel.

It will\n            also establish quality control mechanisms, implement\n            staffing norms, and provide training. The second component,\n            improving health sector financing, will develop and\n            introduce a health insurance scheme with mandatory\n            enrollment for public and formal private sector employees,\n            and develop and test financing mechanisms which ensure\n            access to health care for the poor.
