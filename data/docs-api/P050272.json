The key\n            objective of the project is to facilitate increased\n            participation of the private sector in the economy by\n            creating conditions for improving its productivity and\n            competitiveness. This goal will be achieved by helping\n            accelerate the process of divestiture of public enterprises\n            and facilitating increased private participation; improving\n            the business environment and increasing competition and the\n            contestability of markets; strengthening the linkages and\n            integration of the Ethiopian economy into the global\n            markets; strengthening support for technical and business\n            management skills and thus improving the productivity at the\n            firm level. The project development objective is more\n            aligned with the national objective of export development,\n            and is more measurable. The revised development objective is\n            to improve the enabling environment and institutional\n            capacity for a sustained increase in private sector\n            investment and exports. The two new indicators are added:\n            value of exports in participating firms and targeted sectors\n            increases 25 percent by the end of the project period, and\n            at least 10 firms starting to export as a result of the\n            capacity building support. The project reallocates funds to\n            better performing components. The financial allocation for\n            advisory support with privatization has been reduced, while\n            maintaining a critical mass of funding including for\n            retrenchment and increasing funding for the design of the\n            retrenchment package. The unallocated funds in the original\n            project, US$2.5 million, are now allocated to the enhanced\n            cost of management and funding for the institution building activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -
