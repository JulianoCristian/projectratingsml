Some lessons learned included: more effort is\n            required in assessing likely counterpart funding and\n            recurrent support to proposed investment. The implementation\n            experience demonstrates the value of capacity building for\n            institutional strengthening. There should be greater\n            involvement of all Ministry of Health (MOH) departments,\n            other ministries, Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and\n            to the extent possible the private sector in project design.\n            This helps to build ownership among all agencies\n            implementing project activities. Each implementing body\n            should be aware of its responsibilities. The selection\n            procedures and contractual agreements with NGOs and other\n            implementing agencies should also be worked out before\n            implementation starts. Clear guidelines on project\n            implementation procedures (including procurement and\n            disbursement) are crucial. Procurement plans should be drawn\n            up during appraisal. With the increasing needs in the\n            sector, it is timely to shift from narrowly defined projects\n            to a sector wide program approach with an appropriate\n            financing plan that takes into account both investment and\n            recurrent expenditures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

Regarding the rehabilitation program, the project\n            will carry out essential rehabilitation activities so that\n            key services, water and electrical supplies and sewage\n            systems, are reestablished.
