Lessons learned from the\n            project: During implementation, the irrigation\n            rehabilitation project management faced some difficulties in\n            the selection of interventions that could be considered in\n            the project. Considering the desire to deal with as many\n            systems as possible, in some cases not all bottlenecks were\n            removed from the systems. In countries in transition, time\n            is essential. This project turned out to be very timely as\n            it was urgent to reverse the deterioration of irrigation\n            systems. Good supervision work is essential for satisfactory\n            outcome. Besides the quality and commitment of the project\n            implementation unit staff, the high quality and the\n            continuity of the supervision missions was instrumental to\n            the satisfactory implementation of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic -

This includes the rehabilitation,\n            completion, or improvement in monitoring systems of up to 12\n            irrigation dams.  It will also support inter-farm canal\n            networks to improve drainage.  ii) Capacity building will\n            include implementation support of the Project Implementation\n            Unit which handles the daily management, administration, and\n            coordination of the project.

irrigated agriculture\n            in the project area through improved water supply and will\n            constitute a six year program for irrigation rehabilitation.\n            With regard to direct effects the mitigation program will\n            particularly focus at the mitigation of poor construction\n            practices. The designs will include the designs of properly\n            landscaped silt deposits and the contractors for\n            construction works will be obliged to remove all equipment\n            and un-used construction materials after the works.\n            Undesirably high levels of groundwater will be partially\n            mitigated by improving drainage in some areas, which will\n            also benefit health problems resulting from increased\n            humidity in houses. Beyond that, this project is the first\n            step in a series of projects, in which the increases in\n            water use, inputs of agro-chemicals, waterlogging and\n            salination, and erosion will be dealt with by the follow-up\n            projects -- On-Farm Irrigation Project, Agricultural Support\n            Services Project, Rural Credit Project, and the Sheep\n            Project. It is recommended that all water quality and\n            quantity issues will be dealt with under a comprehensive\n            Integrated Water Management Action Plan identifying all\n            water needs, their mutual interactions and opportunities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Irrigation Rehabilitation\n            Project : environmental
