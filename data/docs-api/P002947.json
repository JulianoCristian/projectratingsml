Some lessons learned included:\n            strength of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) was its\n            focus and internal coherence. The reforms were essential for\n            improving the performance of government and the private\n            sector environment. With the benefit of hindsight, it was\n            important to avoid the temptation of burdening the reforms\n            program with other measures, such as Public Enterprise (PE)\n            or financial sector reform, which could have disrupted SAC\n            implementation. The fact that PE and financial sector\n            reforms were implemented more slowly than expected does not\n            appear to have significantly affected short term growth and\n            SAC outcome. The unfinished reform agenda, and Uganda's\n            continued need for balance of payments and budget support,\n            clearly argues in favor of continued adjustment.\n            International Development Association (IDA) will be expected\n            to play a continuing role in this. However, to avoid\n            unsustainable increases in multilateral debt, IDA Credits\n            should involve attracting donor grants in parallel.\n            Institutional capacity was found to be an important\n            determinant of implementation success. SAC I was\n            successfully implemented because, in addition to enjoying\n            political support, it benefited from continuity in project\n            management, the deployment of the available managerial\n            talent in its execution, and IDA and donor financed TA and\n            related programs. Future Bank operations should ensure that\n            appropriate institutional building is integrated into the\n            program. The experience under SAP suggests that, to tackle\n            poverty more effectively, the design of future programs and\n            their performance might be further improved by ensuring a\n            good understanding of the reforms and their ownership by all\n            other key stakeholders, including the private sector,\n            non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local and\n            national political leaders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Structural Adjustment\n            Credit
