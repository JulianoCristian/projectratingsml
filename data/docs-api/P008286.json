Some lessons learned included: the\n            project concepts and structure were simple but relevant. The\n            focus on institutional development and rehabilitation\n            appropriately concentrated on the essential core aspect of\n            irrigation that needed urgent development. Simplicity and\n            focus prevented risks of over-reach and distraction.\n            Objectives were straightforward and not too ambitious. This\n            was a pattern built in from the start of IDSMIP. This is a\n            lesson with relevance beyond IDSMIP and Azerbaijan. The\n            relationship between the Water User Association (WUA),\n            regional/local offices of the AIOJSC and RSU (Amelioration\n            and Irrigation Open Joint Stock Company and Raion Support\n            Unit) will be long term and should become a partnership of\n            support. Assistance should not create dependency but should\n            be designed to move WUAs toward greater self reliance.\n            Initial delays were caused in project implementation because\n            of lack of experience in preparing legal documents. More\n            training for RSUs and WUA officers in preparing documents\n            for WUA re-registration, water supply agreements, transfer\n            agreements, etc. at the beginning of the next project could\n            help avoid such delays. IDSMIP indicates that WUAs need\n            thorough training and management consultations to enable\n            them to have good irrigation service plans, which is also\n            relevant internationally. The main factor for WUAs achieving\n            sustainability lies in quality of management, operation,\n            repair and maintenance by the WUA. Investment in\n            rehabilitation and institutional development are mutually supportive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Irrigation Distribution System\n            and Management

objective of the\n            proposed Irrigation Distribution System and Management\n            Improvement Project (IDSMIP) is to improve the effectiveness\n            and financial viability of irrigation water distribution and\n            management on 56,000 ha, through provision of support to\n            Water Users Associations (WUA) and the State Amelioration\n            and Irrigation Committee (SAIC). There are 3 components to\n            the project. 1) This component would include several\n            activities, designed to develop sustainable operating WUAs\n            in the country. It would finance technical assistance, goods\n            and training. 2) During project preparation diagnostic\n            surveys were carried out in nine project raions. The main\n            technical findings of the survey work were: (i) on-farm\n            systems are in poor condition with high water losses; (ii)\n            canals are seriously affected by the heavy silt load in\n            irrigation water due to non-functioning desilting at\n            headworks; (iii) there is lack of operational hydraulic\n            structures, and therefore no regulation or water\n            measurement, and thus no incentive for efficient use of\n            water; (iv) pump irrigation is seriously affected by poor\n            quality of pumps and unreliable electricity supply; and (v)\n            significant areas have been affected by salinity, and\n            reclamation would be needed. 3) With the similarities in\n            implementation requirements for the ongoing Rehabilitation\n            and Completion of Irrigation and Drainage Infrastructure\n            Project, the existing PKJ would also be responsible, on\n            behalf of SAIC, for the daily management, administration and\n            coordination of the IDSMIP."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Irrigation Distribution System\n            and
