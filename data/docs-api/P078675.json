Lessons learned from the project: Task\n            management by three different sectoral units was successful.\n            Ensuring broad-based country ownership of and commitment to\n            the reform program is essential for successful\n            implementation. Successful implementation of programmatic\n            operations with the breadth of PAL demands adequate capacity\n            from the borrower. The drive for European Union accession is\n            a powerful impetus for reform. The use of a broad and an\n            umbrella programmatic adjustment program, despite its\n            complexity, can be an effective instrument to garner\n            leverage to support implementation of difficult reforms.\n            Having government manage donor coordination role can be very\n            effective. Flexibility in reform program allows taking\n            advantage of the \"window of opportunity\" in an\n            unfolding reform environment. Maintaining strong country\n            presence is vital, in addition to making infrequent missions\n            from Washington, for keeping dialogue alive between Bank and\n            the
