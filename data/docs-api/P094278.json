Some lessons learned included:\n            for smooth project implementation, it is important to have\n            proper coordination and good relationship between the\n            relevant ministries involved with the implementation of the\n            project. Political stability in the country is important for\n            the smooth implementation and success of a project. For\n            example, political instability which prevailed in the\n            country during the life of the project created a difficult\n            environment for implementation. During four and half years\n            of the project, there were two coup d'etats, (the first\n            one on August 3, 2005, and the other on August 6, 2008); the\n            Prime Minister changed four times, the Minister of Health\n            had changed eight times, and the Director of Directorate of\n            Financial Affairs (DAF) changed four times. All these\n            changes occurred because of the political instability which\n            prevailed in the country during the project period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Health and
