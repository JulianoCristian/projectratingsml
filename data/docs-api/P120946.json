Ratings for the Second Phase of\n            the 135 Programs Supports Credit Project was as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the One-Two Public\n            Investment Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: excessive flexibility regarding the policy\n            content of a programmatic series weakens the program.\n            Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy\n            lending, there is room for striking a better balance between\n            flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially met triggers\n            as prior actions should be considered with particular\n            caution. Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and\n            other external partners to withdraw their support for weakly\n            implemented reform programs and unproductive policy dialogue\n            can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations.\n            The delays in the second operations of P135 and PIR, and\n            PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns with program\n            quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in\n            the case of P135. Arguments for budget predictability under\n            the Paris Declaration are less relevant in Vietnam due to\n            relatively small share of budget support in public\n            expenditures. A strong knowledge base is of critical\n            importance for upstream design of reforms and parallel\n            technical assistance to support their implementation.\n            Selectivity

- First and Second Public\n            Investment Reform Development Policy Operation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the First and Second Public\n            Investment Reform Development Policy Operation Project were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was low; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: an important\n            lesson learned is that it is difficult to achieve\n            significant institutional strengthening in the short time\n            frame of a development policy operation prepared for crisis\n            response. The Bank's decision to design the crisis\n            response as a thematic Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            focusing on a high priority reform area was correct and paid\n            off in terms of garnering the attention of top policy makers\n            on this issue. There is plenty of evidence, as detailed\n            earlier, about the Government's commitment on making\n            progress on reforming the public investment system and\n            restructuring the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector. The\n            Bank will need to work effectively with a range of\n            stakeholders, especially in the public investment area,\n            given the decentralization of decision-making authority on\n            public investments and the challenge to Ministry of Planning\n            and Investment (MPI) in leading the reform process in this\n            decentralized environment. It was not feasible for the Bank\n            to engage more deeply with the other key stakeholders, in\n            particular the provinces, in the limited time frame of the\n            Public Investment Reform (PIR) series, but this engagement\n            will be necessary going forward with the successor Economic\n            Management and Competitiveness Credit (EMCC) operation. For\n            smooth implementation of DPLs, consideration of potential\n            time needed for the completion of triggers must take into\n            account the following factors: (i) borrower's\n            procedures for issuing legal documents and (ii) potential\n            coordination issues among borrower's agencies. The two\n            programmatic operations had a number of triggers that dealt\n            with issuance or preparation of legal documents that\n            required a considerable amount of time for the government to\n            complete the internal procedures not only within the cabinet\n            but also requires the interaction with the national assembly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam

           Investment Reform Operation Program for Vietnam is to\n            support one of the emerging priorities of the Socio-economic\n            Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, namely to raise\n            productivity of investment. Improving the efficiency of\n            investment has emerged as one of the key economic priorities\n            in Vietnam. The country has already achieved rapid economic\n            growth and fast poverty reduction over the last twenty\n            years. However, there is a growing concern that the momentum\n            of a growth strategy that is largely based on factor\n            accumulation may have run its course. Vietnam has one of the\n            highest investments to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ratios\n            in the world, averaging around 43 percent of GDP during the\n            past five years. But the growth rate has not been\n            commensurate with this high investment rate. The\n            inefficiencies in public investment are partly the result of\n            inherited institutional constraints. During the command and\n            control period, public sector investments used to be managed\n            by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). MPI used\n            to compile proposals from line ministries, provincial\n            governments and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and arbitrate\n            among competing demands. The weaknesses of the public\n            investment cycle have also resulted in cost overruns, time\n            delays and slow disbursement of development assistance.\n            There are important gaps between Vietnam's national\n            system and international practices in areas such as\n            environmental screening and environmental management,\n            project preparation and appraisal, procurement, public\n            financial management, the regulatory framework for private\n            participation in infrastructure, and monitoring and\n            evaluation. The program is designed to assist the government\n            of Vietnam (GoV) to strengthen the selection, preparation,\n            implementation and supervision of public investment\n            projects. While much progress has been made over the last\n            decade in the upgrading of public financial management in\n            relation to recurrent expenditures, there are still\n            important weaknesses in the management of investment\n            projects. The program supports a series of policy measures\n            which are expected to strengthen the effectiveness of public\n            investment in Vietnam. The program aims to improve all\n            public investment projects, regardless of their source of\n            funding. The operation, is the second and last in a\n            programmatic series of two."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Second Public Investment Reform\n            Operation
