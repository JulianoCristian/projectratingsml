Instead of growing wheat or barley,\n            thousands of the country's small farmers have been\n            planting crops that need more water but ultimately yield\n            more cash. The transformation comes thanks to investments\n            supported by the World Bank over many years in the\n            country's irrigation and water rights systems.\n            Investments have also been made in building new, gravity-fed\n            irrigation systems that do not need pumps and save a lot of\n            money on fuel, almost $ 35 million. As the global financial\n            crisis hit, the World Bank invested emergency funds for\n            renovation of around 90 km of sections of the main Armavir\n            and Talin, helping to create 12,000 temporary jobs. As a\n            result, water losses in two important main canals have\n            reduced from almost 23 percent to 7 percent. That allows\n            7,000 more hectares to be irrigated. A follow-up project has\n            already been topped up so that more canals in six provinces\n            can be repaired, encouraging further agricultural\n            development and the possibility of increased incomes for\n            Armenia's farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The new landscape of Armenia's agriculture"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"The new landscape of\n            Armenia's agriculture"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/05/24428494/new-landscape-armenias-agriculture","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water users associations, pumping,\n            water management, irrigation systems, water projects, water\n            needs, irrigation, wua, water user, transparency, irrigation\n            networks, meters, orchards, water users, water resource\n            management, irrigation rehabilitation, dams, irrigation\n            infrastructure, pumps, access to irrigation, agricultural\n            development, water, canals, programs, water resource,\n            irrigation development, reservoirs, water fees, irrigation\n            water, farmers, irrigation canals, water losses, bilateral\n            agreement, pumping stations, water rights, gravity, artesian wells"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","projn":"AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency\n            Project -- P116681,AM-Additional Financing To Irep -- P126509,AM-Irrigation Development Additional\n            Financing -- P105171,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety 2 Project -- P088499,AM-Irrigation Development Project -- P055022,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277","topic":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Water Use,Irrigation and Drainage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b082e1d99d_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management,Rural policies and institutions,Other social protection and risk management,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF025793-PHRD-IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT,BBFAO-BB FAO,TF029549-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT\n            SERVICES PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF036016-ECA REGION - WATER AND\n            AGRICULTURE (ARMENIA, UZBEKISTAN),BBFAO-BB FAO,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.

If it is not watered on\n            time - and 10 to 12 times until the autumn harvest - its\n            apples remain small and fall to ground without ever\n            ripening. This is a lesson Armenian farmers learned the hard\n            way when the country\u0092s irrigation system disintegrated under\n            the weight of management chaos and physical neglect\n            following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Erratic water\n            supplies and decrepit canals threatened the livelihoods not\n            only of apple growers but farmers all over the country: 80\n            percent of Armenia\u0092s agricultural output comes from\n            irrigated land. When their orchards died, some farmers in\n            the Ararat valley, the country\u0092s rich-soiled agricultural\n            food basket, were forced to switch to wheat, a less valuable\n            crop which can make do with rain. So today, when orchards\n            are making a come-back, those who revived Armenia\u0092s\n            irrigation system are justifiably proud.

Nonetheless, it downgrades\n            sustainability to likely, though upgrades the Bank\n            performance to highly satisfactory. Lessons are addressed as\n            follows. Given that rehabilitation is only a partial\n            solution for most irrigation projects (i.e., symptom of\n            inadequate management and insufficient maintenance funding),\n            this experience clearly demonstrates that rehabilitation\n            should be supplemented by measures to foster creation of\n            efficient institutions, with the ability, inter alia, to\n            measure and manage water, and cost operation and maintenance\n            accurately. Most effective investments leading to higher\n            levels of efficiency in irrigation projects, are the\n            installation of a large number of water, and electricity\n            flow measuring devices, to be agreed - in consultation with\n            stakeholders - on operating rules. It is critical that\n            adequate attention be given during appraisal to investments\n            linking agricultural technology with the measures to improve\n            production, and marketing of outputs, to avoid jeopardizing\n            the ability of project beneficiaries to cover operation, and\n            maintenance costs. Social assessments are needed,\n            particularly given high levels of rural poverty, to help\n            ensure that infrastructure investments take into account the\n            beneficiaries' ownership, and their ability to\n            contribute towards maintenance of new facilities. In the\n            project, such an approach could have created\n            smallholders' cooperatives, or micro-credit groups,\n            that could have moved landowners beyond subsistence agriculture."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Irrigation Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Irrigation\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/05/4328343/armenia-irrigation-rehabilitation-project","projn":"AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Armenia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040617150601"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,aqueducts,broad range,Brooks,central\n            government,competitive bidding,competitive\n            markets,construction,Consumer Cooperative,cost recovery,crop\n            mix,crop production,cross-subsidies,ditches,economic\n            analysis,economic development,energy consumption,energy\n            efficiency,environmental\n            problem,erosion,expenditures,export,farmers,farming,farms,gas,groundwater,high\n            unemployment,households,income,inflation,irrigation\n            canals,irrigation systems,irrigation water,labor force,Land\n            reform,least cost,local capacity,local\n            engineering,maintenance costs,marginal cost,natural\n            resources,nuclear power,operational costs,Operational\n            Policies,policy decisions,poverty alleviation,poverty\n            line,productivity,pumping,pumping\n            stations,rivers,Sea,snowmelt,sustainable\n            use,system,transparency,water distribution,water fees,Water\n            Law,Water Management,water management,water resources,water\n            resources management,water sales,Water Service,water\n            supply,Water User,Water User Association,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,aqueducts,broad range,Brooks,central\n            government,competitive bidding,competitive\n            markets,construction,Consumer Cooperative,cost recovery,crop\n            mix,crop production,cross-subsidies,ditches,economic\n            analysis,economic development,energy consumption,energy\n            efficiency,environmental\n            problem,erosion,expenditures,export,farmers,farming,farms,gas,groundwater,high\n            unemployment,households,income,inflation,irrigation\n            canals,irrigation systems,irrigation water,labor force,Land\n            reform,least cost,local capacity,local\n            engineering,maintenance costs,marginal cost,natural\n            resources,nuclear power,operational costs,Operational\n            Policies,policy decisions,poverty alleviation,poverty\n            line,productivity,pumping,pumping\n            stations,rivers,Sea,snowmelt,sustainable\n            use,system,transparency,water distribution,water fees,Water\n            Law,Water Management,water management,water resources,water\n            resources management,water sales,Water Service,water\n            supply,Water User,Water User Association,wells"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF032000-ARMENNIA - IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.
