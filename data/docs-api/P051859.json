Some lessons learned included: the\n            project adopted the traditional Bank approach of requiring\n            drainage companies to be established in each city, and\n            assumed that through technical assistance under the project\n            these nascent companies will become autonomous commercially\n            oriented enterprises by the end of the project. Significant\n            reforms are required in government policies and procedures\n            to enable the transfer of government functions to\n            enterprises, including existing assets, staff, (as well as\n            staff benefits for past service), authority and\n            responsibility for decision making, etc. In particular,\n            achieving a commercial orientation and autonomous decision\n            making takes time for government officials. It is important\n            to spell these requirements and steps out clearly and\n            reaches stakeholder ownership at appraisal, and also to\n            agree on their implementation in a phased manner, with clear\n            step-by-step indicators. The project is fortunate in that\n            the follow-on project provides an opportunity for\n            institutional reforms to be continued over a longer period\n            of time. Bank projects in medium sized cities (such as\n            Jinzhou, Panjin, and Yingkou) often provide limited service\n            coverage at a relatively high cost. Even in China, where\n            wastewater charges are levied on all properties, including\n            industries which neither receive piped water supply nor\n            discharge wastewater into sewers, it has not been possible\n            to set high enough tariffs and collect wastewater charges\n            from eligible parties to achieve full cost recovery without\n            subsidies. Instead of permitting unspecified subsidies to\n            make up revenue shortfalls, it will be more effective to\n            seek to achieve full cost recovery over a period of time,\n            with levels of subsidy being reduced to zero on a specified\n            graduated basis over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
