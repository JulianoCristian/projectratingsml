Some lessons learned\n            included: the proactive and consultative approach taken by\n            the Borrower, the Guarantor, and the Bank in closing the\n            project allowed all parties to manage risk and minimize the\n            cost of an unsuccessful project. The need for land\n            acquisition and resettlement is often necessary to ensure\n            safe development and provide social benefits. In case of a\n            major reallocation of resources or significant changes in\n            the priority of components through restructuring, a greater\n            use of the Bank's internal quality control mechanisms,\n            such as a full decision-meeting, and peer reviews will\n            likely improve the outcome of the restructuring. While a\n            project implementation unit (PIU) management structure may\n            have simplified the process of Bank supervision, its\n            effectiveness in achieving program development objectives\n            (PDO's) and ensuring smooth implementation will still\n            have required adequate processes and authority for the PIU\n            to interface and coordinate with various implementing\n            departments and entities.

Infrastructure Project (IMIP) in Turkey are to assist the\n            Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality in: (i) improving its\n            solid waste management; and (ii) improving its capacity to\n            mitigate earthquakes by retrofitting key facilities and\n            infrastructure and upgrading the institutions and their\n            procedures to help them respond to emergencies. The IMIP\n            would consist of four components with the first being\n            improvements in environmental management: this includes\n            closure of existing unauthorized disposal sites for\n            municipal solid waste (landfills) and rehabilitation of\n            creeks; preparation of annual business plans that include\n            operating performance, investment program and financial\n            targets and results; and financing waste collection\n            equipment. The second component is strengthening of\n            municipal services and infrastructure which includes:\n            preparing a detailed risk assessment for all major municipal\n            systems; preparing a Municipal Infrastructure Risk\n            Mitigation Plan; retrofitting of municipal infrastructure\n            (under-passes, pipelines, viaducts etc.); and providing\n            emergency fire department equipment. The third component is\n            the pilot urban transformation program which includes: pilot\n            urban transformation feasibility studies; and retrofitting\n            and construction of buildings, fire stations and emergency\n            housing associated with urban transformation in the most\n            seismic vulnerable areas. The final component is the project\n            management and audits, this consists of: design studies,\n            surveys and technical training for project implementation;\n            and external audits of project accounts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
