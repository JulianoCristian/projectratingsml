Lessons are addressed as\n            follows. The Project design provided a framework, with clear\n            principles in terms of targeting, ownership, and\n            implementation arrangements, and, provided in addition the\n            needed flexibility regarding emerging market opportunities,\n            which could not be anticipated early on. Reflecting on the\n            multiple objectives of components, which could have had a\n            potential risk of conflict, its objectives however, were\n            sharply defined, and priorities agreed upon. In so doing,\n            while the irrigation component was designed for its\n            contribution to grain outputs, and for a positive impact on\n            the protection of groundwater resources, the country\n            however, moved towards a grain surplus situation, and grain\n            prices dropped. But the financially most attractive crops,\n            needed to be supplied with groundwater, e.g., greenhouses or\n            vegetables require regular irrigation year round, for which\n            surface water is less suitable, thus the irrigation\n            component proved successful. Investments in agro-processing\n            can only be successful, if management, and ownership\n            structures are equipped to commercially compete in\n            today's business environment, for the project\n            supported, by and large, highly successful, privately owned,\n            and managed processing enterprises, but at the expense of\n            state-owned enterprises, thus failing to enter into\n            commercial operation. Despite foreseeing these difficulties,\n            the understanding, and commitment to change ownership, and\n            management came mostly too late. Further lessons reinforce\n            the importance of an effective project management, namely on\n            building capacity, on procurement issues, and financial\n            management; and, of Bank staff continuity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shanxi Poverty\n            Alleviation
