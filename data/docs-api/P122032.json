A key factor underpinning Generasi\u2019s\n            success has been the ability of the Project to provide\n            resources to strengthen ongoing community efforts in the\n            areas of outreach and service provision. These efforts\n            represent a major asset on which local government efforts\n            can build during the implementation of the village law.\n            Specific project interventions increased the level of\n            participation of girls and women in community development\n            initiatives. However, men play a key role in decisions that\n            affect maternal and child welfare, such as directing\n            household expenditures towards health and education services\n            and nutritious foods. Efforts must therefore be made to\n            involve men in health and education awareness raising,\n            decision-making, and project implementation. Generasi was\n            integrated in the national government budget cycle, but only\n            to a limited extent in district budgets. This resulted in\n            the absence of an exit-strategy or sustainable financing\n            strategy at the local level, and limited the opportunity for\n            local governments to build on the project's\n            achievements or optimize the use of the assets invested in\n            by the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Additional Financing for Third\n

Program for Community Empowerment in Rural Areas Project\n            (PNPM rural III) for Indonesia is that villagers in PNPM\n            rural locations benefit from improved socio-economic and\n            local governance conditions. This framework serves as an\n            umbrella guideline for the project to identify, consult and\n            provide mechanisms to address potential positive and\n            negative impacts that subprojects may have on Indigenous\n            Peoples (IPs) or Isolated and Vulnerable Peoples (IVPs). It\n            outlines the procedures put in place to ensure that all\n            project activities are assessed and potential IVP issues are\n            identified and addressed before an activity with the\n            potential to affect IVPs commences. This framework reflects\n            the stated objective. It ensure that indigenous peoples\n            participate in and benefit from the project through a free,\n            prior, and informed consultation; and avoid or minimize\n            potentially adverse effects of the project on indigenous\n            peoples' communities. When avoidance is not feasible,\n            minimize, mitigate, or compensate for such effects. The\n            project design of the PNPM rural series and their\n            predecessor, the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), is\n            structured to ensure the participation and inclusion of\n            various groups (including women, the poor, and isolated and\n            vulnerable peoples) in local level decision making over\n            resource allocation.
