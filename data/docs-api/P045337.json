With poverty rising to 23 percent and\n            institutions of government weakening with Suharto's\n            exit, conventional top-down approaches to development did\n            not offer the most effective way to address the needs of the\n            rural poor.

Here\n            also the performances of both the Bank and the Borrower were\n            satisfactory. Six lessons were suggested by these two\n            projects: 1) Translate the project's poverty objectives\n            into clearly defined outcomes and outputs in the Project\n            Appraisal Document that can be monitored and evaluated. 2)\n            Project management has to intervene at the community to\n            support poverty and gender issues and challenge the status.\n            3) Develop an infrastructure maintenance strategy that\n            addresses the total community infrastructure. 4) Reduce the\n            costs -including time spent in meetings -- of beneficiary\n            participation as the number of program's increases. 5)\n            Heed past lessons in rural finance: Effective and\n            sustainable rural finance calls for an institutional\n            capacity to evaluate debt capacity, a sustainable\n            institutional home, low costs, and strong incentives for the\n            borrower(s) to remain in good standing. In the Kecamatan\n            project it was a mistake to force an economic loans\n            component into a grants program outside a carefully prepared\n            rural finance intervention. 6) Define at the outset some\n            kind of baseline (and related milestones) regarding the\n            level of corruption, so as to measure progress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

Kecamatan Development Fund Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project outcome is rated highly\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, and institutional\n            development impacts are high. Many useful lessons for\n            community-driven development projects are drawn from this\n            project. Human resource development, and capacity building\n            are good investments, and critical to program success.\n            Training was especially important since the project was\n            introducing principles, and procedures (i.e., participation,\n            transparency, accountability, etc.) that represented a\n            radical departure from the practices built up under years of\n            authoritarian rule, in a centralized top-down planning.\n            Nevertheless, the project fell short in addressing\n            effectively a number of training competences, and in\n            addressing such training through a sustained strategy for\n            developing capacities continuously, and transferring skills\n            gradually. Similarly, technical assistance (TA), and\n            supervision for village infrastructure projects in\n            particular need to be strengthened. Furthermore, communities\n            also require more quality training in the areas of planning,\n            financial management, and construction skills. Another\n            important lesson is that community participation can improve\n            through better facilitation, communications, and outreach,\n            while poverty targeting within villages was weak, which led\n            to the exclusion of some of the more marginal and poorer\n            segments of the population. Other lessons address the need\n            to increase women's participation; to continue support\n            for an independent civil society monitoring, as well as\n            invest in strong monitoring, evaluations, and studies; to\n            facilitate the redesign of the economic loan portfolio,\n            given the difficulties experienced in managing the\n            micro-credit component; and, to establish mechanisms to\n            reduce corruption."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Kecamatan Development Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -

to alleviate rural\n            poverty levels. The distinctive feature of the project is\n            its highly decentralized nature, which devolves\n            decision-making down to the villagers themselves. A\n            kecamatan, or council, is an administrative unit made up of\n            multiple villages. Villagers are empowered to exercise full\n            control over their developmental decisions from\n            identification of their needs to implementation of the\n            project. The project also focuses on gender equality and\n            encourages women to participate in planning and\n            decision-making activities. The first phase of the project\n            was completed by the Government of Indonesia in September\n            2002. Infrastructure projects for roads, bridges, water\n            supply systems, and school repairs were executed in more\n            than 21,000 villages in about 1,000 kecamatans throughout\n            the country. The Indonesian Department of Home Affairs is\n            currently in charge of the implementation of the next phase,\n            KDP-II. However, high levels of corruption have been\n            reported in relation to the release of funds and the\n            procurement of materials. With loan repayment rates as low\n            as 50-60 percent, the financial sustainability of the\n            project also remains an issue to be addressed. In addition,\n            the project requires a more responsive technical support\n            structure if the objectives set forth in terms of\n            procurement, financial management, and project quality are\n            to be achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kecamatan Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kecamatan Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2003/01/11311281/kecamatan-development-project","count":"Indonesia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, aid, Anti-Corruption,\n            anticorruption, anticorruption measures, beneficiaries,\n            bidding, clinics, communities, Community Driven Development,\n            complaints, Confidence, corruption, credibility,\n            decisionmaking, democracy, development planning,\n            facilitators, financial management, gender, gender equality,\n            government officials, government services, independent\n            monitoring, Infrastructure projects, intermediaries,\n            international Development, media, nongovernmental\n            organizations, Organizational Capacity, participatory\n            planning, poverty alleviation, poverty levels, poverty\n            reduction, priorities, procurement, programs, project\n            design, project implementation, Reconstruction, service\n            delivery, Social Development, Social Development Agenda,\n            Social Policy, sustainability, Sustainable Development,\n            Transparency, village, villages"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"ID-Kecamatan Dev Fund -- P045337","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Social Accountability,Housing & Human Habitats,Development Economics & Aid Effectiveness","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Social Development,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements","authors":{"authr":"Bhatnagar, Deepti;
