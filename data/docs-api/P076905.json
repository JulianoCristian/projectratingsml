The\n            Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review pointed out two\n            lessons. The first is that because it often requires a major\n            crisis to produce the political will, necessary for major\n            power sector reforms, the Bank should maintain a low-key\n            dialogue with countries in this sector, even when they are\n            not in a reform mode, and be prepared to respond when the\n            opportunity for reform arises. This is especially true in\n            sectors such as this one, where the Bank has a long history\n            of involvement, and the resulting detailed knowledge. The\n            second lesson is that it is advantageous to complement\n            adjustment operations with small technical assistance (TA)\n            loans, to help maintain the dialogue \"while leaving the\n            Bank free to determine the appropriate timing of further\n            reform interventions in an uncertain political\n            climate.\" In this case, although the TA loan was\n            delayed, discussion of it with the new administration turned\n            out to be a good way to resume the sector dialogue\".\n            Finally, on a more technical note, the Government\n            demonstrated how to manage a power sector crisis without\n            blackouts, through a clever 20% rationing, which included\n            power saving targets, and incentives to reduce consumption\n            (large consumers trading electricity quotas on the Sao Paulo\n            stock exchange, low income consumers being paid to reduce consumption)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Energy Sector Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Energy Sector Reform\n            Loan

- Energy Sector Reform Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Energy Sector Reform Loan Project\n            will support the Government of Brazil's efforts to\n            restore the normal functioning of the power sector following\n            the recent energy supply crisis, as well as address the\n            immediate regulatory problems that were the underlying cause\n            of the crisis. Regulatory reforms will be focused on setting\n            electricity tariffs at cost recovery levels, allowing an\n            adjustment over time, to thus restore incentives for private\n            sector investments. Implementation of market reforms will\n            improve competitiveness in the wholesale power, and gas\n            supply markets, and remove barriers to private sector\n            investment. Access to electricity will be improved for low\n            income rural consumers, while tariff policy will be modified\n            to ensure affordable electricity tariffs for low income\n            urban consumers. However, two significant elements of risk\n            have been identified: 1) weak institutional capacity to\n            implement key regulatory, and policy reforms; and, 2)\n            potential political constraints, given the uncertainty that\n            the new administration (to take office on January 2003) may\n            not share the same long-term vision for the energy sector.\n            Both risks may be reduced through the parallel Energy Sector\n            Reform Technical Assistance Loan, which incorporates\n            institutional strengthening measures, as a vehicle for\n            continued dialogue with the government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Energy Sector Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Energy Sector Reform\n
