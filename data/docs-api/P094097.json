The overall outcome of these three projects\n            is rated satisfactory, and the performance of the Bank and\n            the Borrower is also rated as satisfactory. Lessons learned:\n            constant engagement with the client is important via a rich\n            technical dialogue and varied portfolio. The multi-sectoral\n            PLaRSSAL program team worked with the Government of Colombia\n            (GoC) in a wide range of lending and non-lending activities,\n            which facilitated the preparation of the program in two key\n            ways. First, the GoC and Bank teams developed a good working\n            relationship over many years. Second, the Bank team, through\n            this continued relationship was well versed in the\n            objectives, strategies, results-management, and outputs of\n            the social sectors, allowing for a greater focus on strategy\n            and implementation in the development of the program. A\n            commitment by the clients to implement a well-designed\n            Government program. The national development plan defined\n            each social institution's strategic objectives for the\n            Uribe administration, thereby providing a base upon which to\n            design the Bank's program. The social institutions were\n            committed to implementing the strategies and meeting the\n            quantifiable targets and saw the value added of Bank support\n            in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - First and Second series of\n            Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment\n            Loans and a Third Labor Reform and Social Development Policy Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - First and Second\n            series of Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural\n            Adjustment Loans and a Third Labor Reform and Social\n            Development Policy Loan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/12/9375193/colombia-first-second-series-programmatic-labor-reform-social-structural-adjustment-loans-third-labor-reform-social-development-policy-loan","projn":"CO-3rd Prog.
