The\n            project's original objective was quite simple: to\n            reconstruct and rehabilitate war-damaged secondary schools\n            and primary teacher training colleges in the three Eastern\n            States. However, in the process of reviewing their future\n            manpower needs in the light of postwar priorities, the three\n            States decided not only to restore facilities to their\n            prewar level but also to consolidate and expand them and,\n            more importantly, to implement reforms in the secondary\n            school curriculum. Nearly half the secondary school student\n            places and nearly three-quarters of the primary teacher\n            training college places to be financed by the proposed loan\n            represent additions to these institutions' prewar\n            enrollment capacity. Apart from the obvious advantage of\n            this modification to and expansion of the original\n            rehabilitation project, other less visible but equally\n            important benefits will follow."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Transcript of joint meeting of the Executive\n            Directors of the IBRD and IDA held on March 28, 1972"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Transcript of joint meeting of\n            the Executive Directors of the IBRD and IDA held on March\n            28, 1972"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1972/03/17916511/transcript-joint-meeting-executive-directors-ibrd-ida-held-march-28-1972","projn":"NG-Education Ii-267078 -- P002018","subtopic":"Gender and Education,Education For All,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education","docty":"Transcript","teratopic":"Gender,Education","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20130625114020"},"subsc":"Secondary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Board transcript","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adult education, adults, age group,\n            agricultural training, attending school, call, curricula,\n            curriculum reform, demonstration, developing countries,\n            dropout rates, education policy, education projects,\n            education sector, educational expenditure, educational\n            needs, educational planning, educational projects, formal\n            education, formal education system, future education, higher\n            education, industrial trAining, let, level of education,\n            Ministries of Education, national education, personnel\n            management, primary curriculum, primary education, primary\n            enrollment, primary level, primary school, primary schools,\n            primary system, primary teacher, primary teacher training,\n            rural areas, school enrollments, secondary education,\n            secondary enrollment, secondary level, secondary school,\n            secondary school curriculum, secondary schools, short\n            courses, show how, student places, teacher, teacher training\n            colleges, teaching, technical education, training abroad,\n            training college, training of teachers, vocational training"}},"owner":"WB Off: Abuja - Western AFR 2 (AFCW2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"78802"},"facets":{}}}
