The lessons learned indicate that the project\n            included well-justified components of technical assistance\n            for the Institutional Development activities under the\n            project, including training and consultancy studies for\n            management strengthening, and the development of tariff\n            policy. However, the project demonstrated that the benefits\n            of such components will remain marginal unless there is\n            total commitment on the part of Government for follow up\n            action. The failure of the vodokanal to raise tariffs during\n            the project period is explained by the role of the national\n            Anti-Monopoly Committee (AMC) and its application of\n            existing laws.
