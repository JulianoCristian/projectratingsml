The\n            project will support these objectives through: (i) the\n            rehabilitation of 150 traditional irrigation schemes in the\n            mountain and high valley zones; (ii) improvements to rainfed\n            agriculture in the above irrigated areas, in the Planalto\n            Mirandes and Terre Quente zones, and in the Douro vineyard\n            zone; (iii) credit to farmers for on-farm investments to\n            support the agricultural development in (i) and (ii); (iv)\n            providing storage facilities and equipment to cooperatives,\n            and for the construction of milking parlors; (v)\n            strengthening of extension and research services in\n            agriculture through additional staff, housing, vehicles,\n            equipment, and technical assistance; (vi) rural\n            infrastructure investments including rural roads and village\n            streets, water supply and sewage disposal, the\n            rehabilitation of about 60 primary school classrooms and\n            other community development works; and (vii) investments in\n            health centers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Portugal -
