Some lessons learned included: in\n            land or forest management projects that aim to induce a\n            change in land use practices and scaling up, it is important\n            to gain an understanding of the motives different types of\n            landholders have to adopt and maintain such practices in\n            addition to technical dimensions of restoration. In this\n            case, the project documented some comparative evidence on\n            the cost and effectiveness of alternative riparian forest\n            restoration technologies that may be of use to future\n            restoration efforts. Consistency between the objectives\n            statements and the scale of investments and associated\n            indicators is essential to avoid incongruities between\n            investment strategy and project intent. In this case the\n            project's official objectives were stated in terms of\n            ambitious global environment objectives. Working through\n            multiple institutional players can enhance policy and\n            operational outcomes but it requires that mechanisms are\n            developed to formalize institutional partnership with\n            clearly defined common targets and timetables to reduce\n            delays. Such mechanisms need to be agreed among all partners\n            upfront and tailored to their own bureaucratic, managerial\n            and operational structures. Early consensus on coordination\n            of monitoring and evaluation (M and E) between institutions\n            and sectors within government is crucial in order to ensure\n            alignment of objectives and targets and to achieve the flow\n            of M and E data between entities. Incompatibilities between\n            the operational structures of the two agencies led to\n            bottlenecks in information flows that made it difficult for\n            the project management team to detect and respond to issues\n            as they arose and provide timely feedback to other project\n            executing entities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Ecosystem
