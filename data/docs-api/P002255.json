The project aimed at helping the Government to:\n            (a) redefine its role in the PE sector and formulate\n            principles for future interventions in new enterprises; (b)\n            improve the institutional and legal framework for PEs; (c)\n            increase the efficiency of the sector through rehabilitation\n            of those enterprises that could be made economically viable,\n            divestiture of those which could be privatized, and\n            liquidation of non-viable ones; and (d) develop national\n            capacity to design, implement and monitor PE reforms. These\n            objectives were relevant as the PERP was seen as an\n            instrument for improving resource allocation within the\n            economy through a program of restructuring and\n            privatization. The goals of the PERP were expressed in\n            specific monitorable measures linked to a timetable. The\n            prevailing mood within the Government and the Bank was\n            torestructure enterprises within the public\n            sector.Bank's performance in terms of support to the\n            Borrower under this project was satisfactory. The key lesson\n            is that the decision to embark on a PE reform program is\n            based as much on political factors as on financial and\n            economic considerations. Implementation of the PERP clearly\n            demonstrates that for a PE reform program to be successful,\n            it is necessary to mobilize support early on from Government\n            officials and the public. The PERP's experience\n            highlights the need for a special high-caliber team to be in\n            charge of the various PE reform processes (liquidation,\n            privatization, restructuring). A special training program\n            should be therefore prepared and made a point of priority in\n            project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Public Enterprise Reform
