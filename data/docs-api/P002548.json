Some lessons\n            learned included: a) in a small country such as Sao Tome and\n            Principe, contract management agencies such as the Social\n            and Infrastructure Fund (SIF), or its successor the\n            Institute for Economic and Social Development (INDES), can\n            be a good mechanism for implementing small-scale, multi\n            sectoral investment projects, provided that the agency has\n            sufficient operational and financial autonomy; operates\n            under a contractual relationship with the Government; uses a\n            market approach in its operations, without Government\n            interference; has the freedom to recruit its own staff and\n            pay them adequately; and can generate revenues from its\n            operations. In designing a multi-sector operation with this\n            kind of implementation structure, it is important to agree\n            on the rules of the game early on, well before negotiations;\n            b) a multi-sectoral program intended to tackle social issues\n            through infrastructure investments runs the risk of focusing\n            its efforts on the physical aspects of the program, i.e. the\n            execution of civil works, at the expense of the software\n            aspects. To avoid this tendency, it is necessary to set\n            realistic targets for achievements in the social sector, and\n            to clearly map out programs and interventions that will lead\n            to reaching these targets. This is especially important in\n            small economies such as Sao Tome and Principe, where\n            donor-financed projects tend to be small and few in number;\n            and (c) the project could have benefited from a mid-term\n            review which would have been helpful to restructure the\n            project and make the necessary adjustments to deal with the\n            worsened macroeconomic reality of Sao Torne and Principe."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sao Tome and Principe -
