The lessons learned indicate that the Pilot\n            Female Literacy Project (PAPF) proved that large scale\n            programs for reaching illiterate populations can be\n            successfully implemented in a relatively short period of\n            time by using the outsourcing approach if the project is\n            well designed and implementation arrangements are\n            appropriately tightened. Mechanisms to simulate and control\n            unit costs, conduct cost-effectiveness analysis, and\n            follow-up on progress of literacy programs based on an\n            agreed set of indicators are key to sound monitoring and\n            evaluation system. In countries similar to Senegal, it is\n            important to stimulate providers' participation in the\n            program through a set of incentives (i.e., institutional\n            support and training).

The main objective of the first phase\n            (1995-2000) is to lower the illiteracy rate to about 40\n            percent overall, and to 47 percent for women, by supporting\n            literacy providers to offer programs to a total of about\n            300,000 beneficiaries, 75 percent women. Other objectives\n            include: 1) ensuring the sustainability of literacy skills;\n            and 2) strengthening the capacity of the private sector to\n            deliver effective programs, and the capacity of the public\n            sector to monitor, evaluate and coordinate public\n            investments in literacy programs. The project will consist\n            of the following components: 1) literacy and post-literacy\n            sub-projects, including: (a) a minimum of 250-300 hours of\n            instruction which is necessary to attain a level of literacy\n            (fourth grade equivalent) where skills are actually acquired\n            and, therefore, can be maintained; (b) meaningful content\n            for adult learners; (c) materials appropriate for adults;\n            (d) teachers knowledgeable about the content and trained in\n            adult education approaches; (e) regular in-service teacher\n            support; and (f) participation of beneficiaries in program\n            design and implementation; and 2) project management and\n            capacity building in program delivery, management, and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Projet d'Appui a\n            l'Alphabetisation Priorite Femmes"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Pilot Female Literacy\n            Project : Senegal - Projet d'Appui a\n            l'Alphabetisation Priorite Femmes"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/05/16687439/senegal-pilot-female-literacy-project-senegal-projet-dappui-lalphabetisation-priorite-femmes","count":"Senegal","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adult education; Adult literacy; In service\n            teacher training; Literacy programs; Nongovernmental\n            organizations; Program evaluation; Project management;\n            Reading instruction; Teaching aids; Women's education,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Adult education; Adult literacy; In service\n            teacher training; Literacy programs; Nongovernmental\n            organizations; Program evaluation; Project management;\n            Reading instruction; Teaching aids; Women's education,,"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Human development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"S\u00e9n\u00e9gal - Projet d'Appui \u00e0\n            l'Alphabetisation Priorit\u00e9 Femmes"}},"projn":"SN-Pilot Female Literacy Project -- P035621","subtopic":"ICT Policy and Strategies,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Education,Gender,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population","entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120903060823"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Adult literacy/non-formal education,Central government administration","theme":"Gender,Social analysis and monitoring,Other financial and private sector development,Education for all","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1996","historic_topic":"Education,Gender,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Education - GP (GEDDR)","trustfund":"TF035741-GAMBIA - PARTICIPATORY HEALTH,\n            POPULATION AND NUTRITION,TF038735-SENEGAL - RESEARCH - PILOT\n            FEMALE LITERACY - NATIONAL PROGRAM,TF038755-SENEGAL - NATIONAL LITERACY\n            PROGRAM - RESEARCH ON PILOT FEMALE LITERACY,TF021432-UN SPECIAL INITIATIVE FOR AFRICA,TF022496-PROGRAM TO PROMOTE GIRLS'\n            EDUCATION II","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sahel"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sahel"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sahel"},"3":{"geo_region":"Sahel"}},"repnb":"15517"},"facets":{}}}
