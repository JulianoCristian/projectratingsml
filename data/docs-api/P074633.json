The\n            Core Document sets out a five-year plan with three primary\n            objectives: (i) ensuring access and equity in primary\n            education, (ii) enhancing quality and relevance of primary\n            education, (iii) improving efficiency and institutional\n            capacity. A significant proportion of the total population\n            of Nepal are Dalits and indigenous people (recent estimates\n            from the 2001 census suggest 16 percent Dalits and 36.4\n            percent indigenous population). Because they inhabit all\n            regions and districts of Nepal covered by this broad\n            national education project, a Vulnerable Communities\n            Development Plan is an essential prerequisite for achieving\n            the stated objective of social inclusion in primary\n            education as set out in the NEFA Core Document. The central\n            goal for this VCDP is to assess the capacity of the NEFA\n            programme to offer inclusive education to meet the learning\n            needs for all disadvantaged communities in Nepali society,\n            including ethnic minorities, women, Dalits and indigenous\n            people and linguistic minorities through equal access to\n            educational resources. The overall Project Development\n            Objective of the EFA Core Document for Nepal is to\n            strengthen Nepal's institutional capacity at national,\n            district and school levels so as to deliver more efficient\n            and better education services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Education for All Project :\n            indigenous peoples plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Education for All Project\n            : indigenous peoples plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/03/5689668/nepal-education-all-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","projn":"NP-Education For All Project -- P074633","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050325101211"},"subsc":"Adult literacy/non-formal education,Sub-national government administration,Primary education,Pre-primary education,Other social services","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Education programs, vulnerable people,\n            social exclusion, primary education, equity, institutional\n            capacity, indigenous people, indigenous population,\n            vulnerable communities, development plan, social inclusion,\n            disadvantaged communities, ethnic groups, education\n            services, safeguard policies, policy framework"}},"owner":"S.A.

Some lessons\n            learned includes: International Development Association\n            (IDA) has supported education in Nepal for over three\n            decades, and has constantly evolved its approach to\n            developing the sector based on the lessons learnt from its\n            projects. In designing the last program of the current\n            series, School Sector Reform Plan (SSRP), it has continued\n            to integrate and build on the lessons learned from the\n            implementation of past programs. From the perspective of\n            wider application, the EFA program provides some important\n            overall lessons. Specifically, four key lessons emerge from\n            the successful implementation of the EFA program: (i) a\n            Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) that supports the\n            Government's own program and relies on Government\n            structures for implementation can be an effective tool to\n            harmonize partner support, strengthen sectoral management\n            capacity and reduce transaction costs; (ii) high level\n            political commitment is critical to achieve difficult\n            reforms as is bureaucratic buy-in; (iii) effective\n            communication, specifically on progress of reforms can play\n            a critical role in ensuring sustainability of reforms; (iv)\n            participatory processes to engage communities and mobilize\n            beneficiaries can be a powerful means to achieve results.\n            Adequate capacity building is crucial to enable effective\n            decentralization, particularly at the village and community\n            levels. The reforms introduced under the EFA program\n            successfully decentralized administrative and financial\n            authority to local community bodies, i.e. the School\n            Management Committees (SMCs). To be truly meaningful, this\n            reform needs to be accompanied with strong capacity support\n            to ensure that the SMCs play their roles effectively.\n            Capacity support needs to be continuous and focused.\n            Balancing incentives to students with incentives to schools:\n            To date, strategies to enhance educational outcomes of the\n            disadvantaged have focused on increasing access through\n            provision of incentives such as scholarships."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Education for All

landlocked but relatively populous country\n            in South Asia, with about 28 million people. By the early\n            1950s the country had only twenty two high schools, of which\n            twenty were community built, financed and managed. In 1972,\n            however, the government took over more than 8,000 schools.\n            But 30 years of neglect had taken a heavy toll. Literacy\n            rates were 52 percent, compared to 58 percent in South Asia\n            and 61 percent among low-income countries around the world.\n            The International Development Association financed Community\n            School Support Project was launched in 2003 to help reform\n            the defunct public school system. Net primary enrollment\n            rose from 84 percent in 2003 to 92 percent in 2008. Gender\n            parity improved from 83 percent to 98 percent during the\n            same period. More than 8,600 schools transferred back to\n            community management for the transition in education sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Community management rekindles

   long-term development objective is to improve access to, and\n            benefit from basic and primary education for children,\n            especially girls and children from disadvantaged groups, and\n            from literacy programs for poor adults. The project will\n            achieve three strategic goals: a) improving access to, and\n            equity of basic and primary education; b) enhancing\n            educational quality and relevance; and, c) improving\n            efficiency, and institutional capacity of education service\n            delivery. This additional grant will help fill the financing\n            gap - estimated at US$87l million for the remaining two\n            years - resulting from a cost overrun of core project\n            activities and scaling up of reforms for improved quality\n            and efficiency. The financial gap estimated at US$25 million\n            at the beginning has increased very significantly due to:\n            (a) government's commitment to provide free primary\n            education and meet the popular aspirations of universal\n            primary education, which entailed funding additional\n            teachers and non-salary costs including additional\n            classrooms;

Education for All Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Education for All Project's\n            long-term development objective is to improve access to, and\n            benefit from basic, and primary education for children,\n            especially girls and children from disadvantaged groups, and\n            from literacy programs for poor adults. The project will\n            achieve three strategic goals: a) improving access to, and\n            equity of basic and primary education; b) enhancing\n            educational quality and relevance; and, c) improving\n            efficiency, and institutional capacity of education service\n            delivery. First, equitable access will be approached through\n            measures to increase both the demand for education, and the\n            supply of services. On the demand side, expanded involvement\n            of community-based organizations in identifying, and\n            motivating out of school children to enroll, will strengthen\n            school outreach. Increased literacy for mothers is also\n            expected to have a long-term positive impact. Scholarships,\n            funded through school grants, targeted to poor girls,\n            \"dalits\" and out of school \"janajati\"\n            children, will offset the private costs of schooling for\n            these groups. Additionally, expansion of classrooms, and\n            non-formal programs based in schools, should accommodate\n            growing demand. Resources will also be provided to\n            communities for constructing temporary classrooms. Literacy\n            programs for adult women, targeted to dalits and ethnic\n            minorities, will be expanded. Second, early childhood\n            development (ECD), delivered through community managed\n            centers, and through pre-primary classes, will be expanded,\n            supporting teacher education through a certificate training.\n            Recurrent in-service teacher training will be strengthened,\n            while substantial funding through the School Grants Program\n            (SGP) will enable financing local expertise, including\n            teacher training. Improved school facilities, and newly\n            developed transitional language support on entry for\n            non-Nepali speaking students, will further improve learning\n            quality, retention of children, and school completion rates.\n            And third, improving efficiency and institutional capacity,\n            will finance the transfer of primary schools to community\n            management, through grants support.
