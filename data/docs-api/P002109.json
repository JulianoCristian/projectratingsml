These projects represent a clear\n            evolution in the scope of World Bank lending: the first\n            project was nationwide and concentrated on procurement and\n            installation of equipment in selected water systems in each\n            of the 36 Nigerian states and the National Federal\n            Territory; the second project was restricted to two states\n            (Kaduna and Katsina); and the third project directly\n            assisted 16 small towns. This assessment rated the outcome\n            of the National Water Rehabilitation Project as highly\n            unsatisfactory, sustainability highly unlikely, negligible\n            institutional development Impact, and unsatisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.  For the First\n            Multi-State Water Supply Project, the assessment concurred\n            with the completion report, except that the PPAR rated the\n            outcome as moderately satisfactory. The PPAR rated the\n            outcome of the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project as satisfactory with likely sustainability,\n            substantial institutional development impact and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            There are three principal lessons: First, the targets under\n            the MDGs for water supply and sanitation, focusing only on\n            service coverage and access, need to be expanded to include\n            the reliability and quality of water supplies.  Second,\n            effective coordination between central, state and local\n            governments requires demand-driven approaches where the\n            consumers have the initiative. Third, maintenance merits\n            priority over new works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - National Water Rehabilitation,\n            First Multi-State Water Supply, and Small Towns Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - National Water\n            Rehabilitation, First Multi-State Water Supply, and Small\n            Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6933883/nigeria-national-water-rehabilitation-first-multi-state-water-supply-small-towns-water-supply-sanitation-projects","projn":"NG-Small Towns Water -- P064008,NG-Water Rehab -- P002084,NG-State Water I -- P002109","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Infrastructure Regulation,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060719121550"},"subsc":"Water supply,Other industry,Central government administration,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to safe water, access to water\n            supply, adequate sanitation, administrative support,\n            bacteriological quality, Basin Development, broad range,\n            central government, child mortality, community\n            participation, competitive bidding, continuity of service,\n            distribution systems, Electric Power, groundwater,\n            groundwater sources, households, incentive structure, large\n            water resource, least cost, liters per capita per day, local\n            communities, maintenance of water, maintenance standards,\n            management of water, mortality rate, natural resources,\n            operational performance, operational performance indicators,\n            Operational Policies, pathogens, performance indicators,\n            piped water, pollution, population growth, population growth\n            rate, potable water, power supply, private operators,\n            programs, project management, provision of water, provision\n            of water supply, quality of service, quality of water,\n            quantity of water, River Basin, sanitary excreta disposal,\n            sanitation sector, sanitation services, service delivery,\n            service demand, service quality, Small Town, Small Town\n            project, Small Town Water, Small Town Water Supply, SMALL\n            TOWNS, SMALL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY, STATE WATER, sustainable\n            use, training needs, transaction costs, transparency, urban\n            areas, Urban Water, Utility staff, Water Board, Water\n            Boards, water distribution, water projects, water quality,\n            water quality data, water quality studies, water resource,\n            Water Resources, water samples, Water Sector, Water Sector\n            Reform, water service, water services, water supplies, WATER\n            SUPPLY, water supply projects, water supply service, water\n            supply services, water supply systems, water system, water\n            systems, water treatment"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"2":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF027200-NATIONAL WATER REHABILITATION FUND,TF040474-NIGERIA:  STATE WATER I -\n            PROJECT ANALYSIS IN PREPARATION OF THE ICR,TF038558-NIGERIA: SMALL TOWNS W.

The following lessons\n            reflect in part, an increased awareness on the need for\n            major institutional reforms. The commercialization of public\n            institutions was hindered namely by the Government's\n            unwillingness to give autonomy, without which sustainable,\n            commercial institutional arrangements do not succeed. This\n            was further exacerbated by the disparity of water demand\n            estimates as related to the prices charged: it shows water\n            being sold very cheaply, highly subsidized, with a large\n            over-capacity. Regrettably, the Bank failed to pursue this\n            issue further. Dependence on external factors should be\n            carefully assessed, for while the project did provide\n            standby generators, electricity Boards were unable to pay\n            for the additional, operational fuel costs, which indicates\n            particular attention should be given to supporting sectors\n            of the economy when same are not thriving. Moreover,\n            institutional development by and large, must be viewed as a\n            continuum, based on a programmed approach, where\n            institutional changes demand more radical interventions from\n            both the utility in question, and the state government.\n            Finally, resettlement issues require a pragmatic assessment\n            by the Bank, rather than the purist approach of\n            environmental assessment, and, regardless of supervision\n            budgets constraints, technical staff can help review, and\n            resolve lagging implementation activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Multistate Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Multistate Water Supply

growth by\n            enhancing health and productivity of urban areas, helping to\n            alleviate poverty by improving health standards of the\n            lowest income urban households and the living conditions of\n            women. Negative measures include: water pollution, dust, air\n            pollution, noise pollution, waste management, soil erosion,\n            and pest management. Mitigation measures include: a) minimum\n            tillage technique should be adopted in the catchment area as\n            against deep ploughing. The use of animal drawn ploughs\n            noticed during the time of visit is a step in the right\n            direction; b) use of insect hormones, hormone analogue or\n            other chemicals that can mimic the action of insect hormones\n            to alter hormone-regulated processes like moulting,\n            metamorphosis, reproduction etc; c) biological control of\n            pests is the use of pest parasites and predators to wipe out\n            unwanted species or populations of pests; d) where\n            water-borne sanitation becomes inevitable because of rapid\n            urbanization as is expected here, the framework for the\n            treatment of sewage should be laid down; and e) water\n            pollution control legislation should be reviewed and\n            institutional arrangements for enforcement should be established."},"docna":{"cdata!":"environment impact assessment of Zonkwa dam"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria -
