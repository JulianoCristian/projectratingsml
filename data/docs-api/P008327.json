The project outcome of the\n            Enterprise And Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project\n            (TAL) is moderately satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory.\n            For the Capital Markets Development Project (CMDP), outcome\n            is rated moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability is\n            unlikely; institutional development impact is modest; and\n            both Bank and Borrower performance are unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons of general applicability include the following: 1)\n            Without complementary measures for facilitating entry and\n            exit, maintaining hard budgetary constraints, and imposing\n            corporate managerial accountability, privatization is\n            unlikely to produce significant growth or productivity\n            benefits. 2) Troubled banks should be liquidated or\n            privatized quickly, and their lending strictly controlled\n            while in that process. 3) The experience with the EFSAL\n            suggests that, although additional delays may be incurred\n            and costs increased, on balance long-run development\n            benefits are likely to be enhanced by canceling projects\n            with major design flaws and addressing the reform needs with\n            a superior instrument. 4) Development of domestic capital\n            markets makes little sense, until basic issues for private\n            sector development, such as privatization and financial\n            stabilization, have been resolved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -

Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory overall. Borrower performance overall is also\n            judged satisfactory given the positive outcome and high\n            probability of sustainability of the reforms. These were the\n            lessons learned: 1) the use of technical assistance to\n            support both preparation and implementation is crucial\n            especially in complex operations such as this one. The EFSAL\n            would have benefited from a well-crafted communications\n            strategy and a supporting social sector operation. It would\n            have improved implementation and the social consequences of\n            the reform would have benefited from greater analysis and\n            perhaps a supporting operation to alleviate the impact on\n            vulnerable groups. 3) The coverage and importance of EFSAL\n            reforms requires a coordination mechanism that is also able\n            to signal to all levels of government the importance of the\n            reforms. Using the council of ministers, or a subgroup\n            within the council, as the coordination mechanism, supported\n            by technical assistance, is one model that has worked in at\n            least one other ECA country with similar reforms. This may\n            mitigate the risk of lack of commitment of certain parts of\n            the government and will likely imrpvoe implementation. 4)\n            the nature of the program, the time period involved for\n            implementation, and the uncertain environment make a\n            programmatic approach more appropriate since it is more\n            flexible in design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Enterprise and\n            Financial Sector

The government will aim to maintain a stable\n            macroeconomic framework within which essential structural\n            reforms can be implemented. The main  components of the\n            enterprise and financial sector reform program include: (1)\n            accelerating the  privatization of the former socially-owned\n            enterprises; (2) restructuring and privatizing public\n            enterprises; (3) rehabilitating and privatizing the banking\n            system; (4) providing key elements of the enabling\n
