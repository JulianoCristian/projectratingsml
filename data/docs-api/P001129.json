The project achieved most of\n            its objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, the project\n            confirms that consumers' ability to pay and cost of\n            installation are fundamental factors for the success of the\n            project and should rank ahead of preoccupation with modern\n            design or durability based on experience in temperate\n            climates. Second, staff training should emphasize design and\n            operation of distribution facilities in the country rather\n            than overseas. Third, institutional strengthening of the\n            utility should look beyond the overall corporate level and\n            include improvements at the division and department level.\n            Fourth, middle managers should be helped to become\n            proficient in project accounting and cost control of the\n            subprojects for which they are, or should be, directly\n            responsible. Fifth, corporate reorganizations and shifts of\n            personnel should not be encouraged unless continuity of\n            functions can be ensured. Finally, when a substantial\n            reallocation of funds occurs within a loan, the task of\n            supervision should be simplified if all changes were\n            recorded and explained in a single document."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ivory Coast -
