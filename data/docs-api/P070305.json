Some\n            lessons learned included: the project structure and\n            objectives had a focus on learning, but the lack of an\n            adequate monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system\n            prevented to capture some of the lessons learned during\n            implementation. From the identification the Bank should\n            support the implementing agencies in establishing and\n            maintaining a valid M&E system, in case of insufficient\n            capacity. This project was designed as pilot which objective\n            to test sustainable development mechanism involving\n            conservation and economic activities. The project had\n            altogether 10 indicators which were difficult to achieve\n            given the economic and political situation of the country at\n            the time. Small project should have modest objectives and\n            indicators. A combination of integrated development planning\n            outcomes with policy reform would have been beneficial to\n            the project outcomes, by setting the legal or administrative\n

Project (CMBMP) is to be implemented\n            in four coastal districts of the two most northern provinces\n            in Mozambique. The CMBMP concept and project design promote\n            the development of different sustainable resource use\n            activities in buffer and interstitial zones created around\n            protected areas. The project also explicitly links\n            conservation and tourism development activities to community\n            participation and access to direct and indirect benefits, as\n            well as encourages community land delimitation to strengthen\n            their rights bases. The development of community managed\n            nature tourism may require land acquisition to build and\n            develop infrastructure, and buildings. The project may also\n            cause displacement of people from their homes and habitual\n            resource use areas as a result of the level of restrictions\n            placed on resource use on and in the coral filled areas\n            around some isolated islands, coastal and riverine (Rovuma\n            river) habitats scheduled to be protected. Presently the\n            location, nature and scope of land acquisition and\n            displacement are not yet known; hence this resettlement\n            policy framework  establishes the policy principles for\n            developing specific resettlement action plans. When\n            developed through community involvement, the resettlement\n            action plan will identify conflict resolution mechanisms,\n            and focus on particular on the needs of vulnerable groups,\n            especially those living below the poverty line, the\n            landless, the elderly, women and children, indigenous\n            peoples and ethnic minorities. Implementation of\n            resettlement activities must be linked to the implementation\n            of the investment component of the project to ensure that\n            displacement or restriction of access does not occur before\n            necessary measures for resettlement are in place. Measures\n            required prior to displacement include provision of\n            compensation and of other assistance required for\n            relocation, and preparation and provision of resettlement\n            sites with adequate facilities. The taking of land and\n            related assets may take place only after compensation has\n            been paid and, where applicable, resettlement sites and\n            moving allowances have been provided to the displaced\n            persons. Cash compensation for lost assets should be paid\n            for livelihood sources that are not land-based. Compensation\n            levels should be sufficient to replace the assets at full\n            replacement cost in local markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Coastal and Marine Biodiversity\n
