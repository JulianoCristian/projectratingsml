Youth Inclusion Project (LIL)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main purpose of the Learning\n            Innovation Credit (LIC) is to determine (through pilot\n            testing) whether targeted youth (14-30) from poor/vulnerable\n            rural and pen-urban households in participating local areas\n            will adopt positive economic/social practices and reduce\n            risky behaviors in response to an integrated and inclusive\n            package of youth-oriented services and opportunities. The\n            project has the following four components: Component 1) will\n            directly address non-income dimensions of youth poverty and\n            social exclusion such as powerlessness (often linked with\n            lack of information and isolation); vulnerability and\n            exposure to risky behaviors (e.g. drug abuse, alcoholism)\n            due to idleness and lack of spaces for safe and constructive\n            free-time activities; and gender-specific dimensions of\n            vulnerability such as domestic violence. Indirect outcomes\n            on income-dimensions of poverty are also expected to occur\n            as youth-serving spaces and civil society initiatives will\n            be encouraged to provide skills enhancement activities\n            leading to possible future income-generation activities.\n            This component includes two sub-components: (i) the\n            establishment of a network of regional youth-friendly\n            centers; and (ii) a competitive grants program for\n            youth-serving civil society associations to promote their\n            creative initiatives for youth's socio-economic\n            inclusion and empowerment (increased social capital and\n            participation in decision-making). Component 2) in selected\n            regions, this component will create enabling conditions for\n            unemployed and/or precariously employed adult young women\n            and men to invest in skills and assets leading to better\n            self- and wage -employment opportunities. This component\n            concentrates on testing mechanisms to increase\n            responsiveness to, and demand for youth within the financing\n            and the economic sector (financing institutions,\n            enterprises). Sub-component 2.1 aims at supporting youth\n            entrepreneurship while Sub-component 2.2 focuses on\n            facilitating youth entry into wage employment. Component 3)\n            will focus on the state sector as a youth-serving entity and\n            will support: (a) Strategy, policy development and\n            capacity-building in relevant areas; (b) external and\n            internal communication; (c) a comprehensive, learning\n            -oriented participatory system of monitoring, and\n            evaluation. Component 4) will finance the necessary\n            activities to ensure successful project implementation\n            within the expected time, budget and performance parameters"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -
