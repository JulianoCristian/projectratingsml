The key lessons\n            learned from the implementation of the project are: to\n            effectively monitor completion of any activity, clear\n            performance targets need to be set at appraisal; to assess\n            the success or failure of any program, the expected output\n            need to be established at project appraisal; recommendations\n            made by project evaluation study should be evaluated and the\n            relevant recommendations taken into consideration in order\n            to correct any impediment to project implementation and\n            sustainability;
