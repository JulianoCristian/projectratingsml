Lessons learned from the\n            project are as follows: It is important to be flexible and\n            to adjust a project design in response to changing\n            conditions on the ground, even if it means making\n            substantial changes late in the preparation process (or for\n            that matter after a project is formally approved.) It is\n            necessary to carefully consider the trade offs between\n            ensuring successful physical implementation of a project\n            through reliance on foreign expertise and the desire to\n            achieve significant capacity building of local institutions\n            (both public and private) over the medium term. It is\n            important to conduct a careful assessment of the capability\n            of the private sector to assimilate these public sector\n            assets taking into account current market conditions. It is\n            important to design pavement overlays somewhat thicker to\n            avoid rapid deterioration of the pavement surface prior to\n            the next likely maintenance cycle, in countries where\n            regular road maintenance activities remain uncertain."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz -
