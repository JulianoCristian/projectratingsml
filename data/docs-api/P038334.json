Lessons learned were: 1) the expectation of\n            the pace at which the reforms can be implemented and the\n            outcomes realized should be realistic. Given the\n            socio-political constraints the pace of reforms will be\n            determined by the willingness and capacity of the\n            governments to address key reform issues; 2) subsidized\n            power supply to agriculture is a broad public policy issue,\n            not just a sectoral issue. The problem of subsidized power\n            supply to agriculture and resistance to metering is embedded\n            in the political economy of distorted agricultural policies.\n            Sustainable improvement in power sector requires this\n            complex economic and political problem to be addressed; 3)\n            tariff reforms and cost recovery improvement as well as\n            efficiency improvement are essential for the financial\n            turnaround of the power sector. Tariff subsidy to the\n            consumers must be explicitly defined and transparently\n            delivered without compromising the utility's finances;\n            4) public acceptance of sector changes and consequent\n            prospects of sustainability are likely to only come about if\n            the changes result in quickly achieved and highly visible\n            improvements in service quality; and 5) in future, and in\n            general through out the various sectors, while encouragement\n            may well be given for ICB package sizes to be large to\n            encourage international participation and economies of\n            scale, every effort should be made, through market research\n            by the borrower, to ensure that lot sizes are so finalized\n            as to ensure that eligible bids will be received from the\n            most likely source."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Rajasthan Power Sector Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Rajasthan Power Sector\n            Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/7394058/india-rajasthan-power-sector-restructuring-project","projn":"IN-Rajasthan Power Sector Restructuring\n            Project -- P038334","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Energy Production and Transportation,Technology Industry,Infrastructure Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Energy,Industry","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070215105148"},"subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power,Renewable energy,Power,Other social services","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Energy,Industry","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, approach, audits, autonomy,\n            availability, balance, Basic, benefit streams, bulk power,\n            Climate change, Codes, collection efficiency,\n            Commercialization, Components, contract management, cost\n            effectiveness, cost of power, cost recovery, customer\n            satisfaction, debt, debt restructuring, deficits,\n            distribution assets, distribution companies, distribution\n            losses, District heating, economic development, economies of\n            scale, efficiency improvement, efficiency improvements,\n            Electricity, electricity consumption, electricity\n            generation, electricity generators, electricity market,\n            Electricity sales, employment, Energy Conservation, Energy\n            Efficiency, engineering, Environmental, Environmental\n            management, environmental performance, Environmental\n            policies, equipment, Exchange Rate, expenditures, Financial\n            Management, Financial performance, Financial Rate of Return,\n            Financial Restructuring, Generation, generation capacity,\n            grid renewable energy, independent regulation, information\n            technology, Infrastructure services, institutional change,\n            institutional development, International Competitive\n            Bidding, inventory, investment program, joint venture, Key\n            Performance Indicators, low tariffs, management information\n            systems, mandates, net savings, open access, payment\n            obligations, peak capacity, Performance Indicators,\n            political economy, POWER, power availability, power\n            companies, power lines, POWER SECTOR, Power Sector Reform,\n            private sector investments, privatisation, privatization,\n            public hearings, public policy, registers, Renewable energy,\n            renewable energy development, savings, social services,\n            supply tariffs, Sustainable Development, tariff adjustments,\n            Tariff reforms, tariff revisions, tariff structures,\n            Technical Assistance, transformers, transmission lines,\n            utilities, utility companies, voltage, Willingness to Pay,\n            wind, wind power, WTP"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020484-BNPP-ENERGY : THE NETHERLANDS\n            ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY, ASIA ALTERNATI,TF021386-SHELTER FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES,TF022150-PHRD 2-PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM\n            I/CFS CONL'T,TF022510-PRIVATE POWER DEVELOPMENT,TF022621-PHRD-SEBS ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT,TF022865-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY &\n            PROJECT DEV.,TF025214-PHRD-STATE POWER SECTOR RESTRUCT.PROGRAM,TF025404-PHRD-DSM PLANNING IN STATE\n            POWER SECTOR RESTRUCT.
