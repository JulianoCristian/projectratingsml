Ratings for the\n            First, Second, Third Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery\n            Credit Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Fourth Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit Grant\n            Project were as follows:  outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            and the Bank and the Borrower performance were satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included:  overall, the ERR operations\n            were effective in providing critical budget support to\n            Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) during the initial\n            post-conflict years. The effectiveness was greater in\n            directly supporting the demobilization effort under the DDR\n            program, achieving the initial protective, social, and\n            economic security advances, and in accomplishing process\n            improvements, than in achieving better governance, improved\n            allocation of budget resources and development results in\n            the longer run. Early start of Bank interventions and\n            informed risk taking can help consolidate the peace process.\n            Delayed adoption of a country strategy and programmatic\n            budget support weakens ownership, creates funding\n            uncertainty, and hampers capacity building under the\n            circumstances. Stronger signaling of longer-term resource\n            availability for budget support and capacity-building\n            substitutes for the lack of formal programmatic framework.\n            While project or program designs were kept simple and\n            realistic, more could have been done to develop an\n            appropriate results framework calibrated to post-conflict\n            country circumstances. The Bank is (often) expected to\n            assume a leading role in mobilizing and coordinating\n            external donor assistance in post-conflict situations, and\n            is not always adequately resourced to do this. In\n            recognition of this, post-conflict Bank programs may benefit\n            from senior management support that would enable country\n            teams to more appropriately structure

Lessons nonetheless\n            convey the following. Lending for development policy should\n            not rely on conditionality alone to catalyze, and implement\n            reforms. The Government should be made fully aware of the\n            technical and financial requirements of each agreed reform\n            at the identification stage of the operation, in order to\n            facilitate implementation later. Thus, to be fully\n            successful, the implementation of policy must be supported\n            by other instruments that provide technical assistance, and\n            help build country capacity step by step. This backstopping\n            should be coordinated with key development partners in the\n            donor community, because the Bank's resources are\n            limited. Lessons further highlight that the tension between\n            performance and macroeconomic stability should be\n            anticipated, for the cost of slippages to macro stability is\n            higher in Sierra Leone because there are only four budget\n            support donors - delays on the part of one donor mean\n            roughly 25 percent less budget support. In this context, it\n            is useful to acknowledge that the all or nothing\n            requirements for the release of funds utilized by the\n            project, created an incentive to complete reforms, yet\n            macroeconomic stability was reduced when weak capacity\n            slowed the achievement of required actions. In essence, the\n            design of the credit did not fully anticipate the delays\n            that are likely to occur in post-conflict states. Lessons\n            further emphasize the need to find an empowered leader from\n            within Government to coordinate implementation of the reform\n            program, and a champion to lead the reform program. Most\n            importantly, a comprehensive program of capacity building by\n            the Government should be accomplished, through recruitment\n            and training programs, especially in-house training to\n            ensure valued staff remain on-hand as needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Third Economic Rehabilitation\n            and Recovery Credit

The President\n            of the World Bank is satisfied that the government has met\n            the required conditions. Substantial progress has been made\n            relative to the situation at war's end in January 2002\n            with strong support from the donor community. The Borrower\n            is strongly committed to consolidating the peace and\n            building a better future. A solid macroeconomic track record\n            has been established with a series of five successful\n            reviews under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility\n            (PRGF) arrangement with the International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF). The Government has also established a good track\n            record of successful reforms leading to improvements in\n            governance and in the environment for private sector-led\n            investment. A draft Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper has\n            been completed and is under review by the authorities prior\n            to distribution.

This includes maintaining macroeconomic\n            stability, revising the investment code to make it more\n            transparent and competitive to attract investors, further\n            liberalizing the trade regime, pursuing its divestiture\n            strategy and implementing reforms in the mining sector. The\n            credit will allow the import of essential commodities,\n            including food products, petroleum products, and the raw\n            materials and intermediate goods required for economic\n            reconstruction and rehabilitation of social and economic\n            infrastructure country-wide.
