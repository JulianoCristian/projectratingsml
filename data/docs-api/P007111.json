In addition, the project plans to help (i) minimize\n            the environmental impact of the disaster and related\n            reconstruction programs; (ii) enhance the National Oil\n            Company's (CEPE) capacity to deal with the crisis and\n            its aftermath; and (iii) enhance the Government's\n            preparedness to deal with future national emergencies.  To\n            this end, the proposed project consists of:  (i) equipment\n            and civil works related to the reconstruction of the\n            Trans-Ecuadorian crude oil and liquid petroleum gas (LPG)\n            pipelines; (ii) well-workovers and\n            rehabilitation/maintenance works required to avoid long-term\n            damage to the oil fields due to the interruption of\n            production and (iii) oil field development to boost oil\n            extraction to a level of about 320,000 B/D by the end-1987\n            in order to recoup lost production.  Finally, the project\n            entails (iv) technical assistance, including engineering,\n            management and inspection services, and consultants to\n            prepare a plan for the management of future national emergencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Emergency Petroleum Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Emergency Petroleum\n            Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/04/739697/ecuador-emergency-petroleum-reconstruction-project","projn":"EC-Petroleum Recons -- P007111","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Engineering,Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Ecuador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926071940"},"subsc":"(Historic)Refining, storage and distribution","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"arable land,barrel,barrel of oil,barrels of\n            oil,Barrels Per Day,block valves,crossings,crude oil,crude\n            oil production,disasters,domestic energy,domestic\n            use,drilling,earthquakes,economic circumstances,economic\n            situation,energy use,engineering,engineering,environmental\n            impact,environmental standards,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,extraction,flexibility,floods,forestry,freezing,fuel,gas\n            plant,gasoline,Gasoline\n            prices,imports,Income,insurance,investment\n            expenditures,Liquefied Petroleum\n            Gas,management,Mines,National Oil,oil companies,Oil\n            Company,oil consumption,oil exports,oil field,oil fields,oil\n            industry,oil pipeline,oil pollution,oil price,oil\n            production,oil products,Oil reserves,oil revenues,oil\n            sector,Petroleum,Petroleum Gas,petroleum\n            infrastructure,petroLeum prices,petroleum\n            production,petroleum sector,Pipeline,pipeline\n            construction,pipeline system,pipelines,pollution,population\n            densities,pressure,price of gasoline,production\n            capacity,productivity,public expenditures,Public\n            Works,pumps,refineries,rescue,river basins,rivers,soil\n            erosion,transport,Urban Development,water quality,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"arable land,barrel,barrel of oil,barrels of\n            oil,Barrels Per Day,block valves,crossings,crude oil,crude\n            oil production,disasters,domestic energy,domestic\n            use,drilling,earthquakes,economic circumstances,economic\n            situation,energy use,engineering,engineering,environmental\n            impact,environmental standards,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,extraction,flexibility,floods,forestry,freezing,fuel,gas\n            plant,gasoline,Gasoline\n            prices,imports,Income,insurance,investment\n            expenditures,Liquefied Petroleum\n            Gas,management,Mines,National Oil,oil companies,Oil\n            Company,oil consumption,oil exports,oil field,oil fields,oil\n            industry,oil pipeline,oil pollution,oil price,oil\n            production,oil products,Oil reserves,oil revenues,oil\n            sector,Petroleum,Petroleum Gas,petroleum\n            infrastructure,petroLeum prices,petroleum\n            production,petroleum sector,Pipeline,pipeline\n            construction,pipeline system,pipelines,pollution,population\n            densities,pressure,price of gasoline,production\n            capacity,productivity,public expenditures,Public\n            Works,pumps,refineries,rescue,river basins,rivers,soil\n            erosion,transport,Urban Development,water quality,water supply"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P4515"},"facets":{}}}
