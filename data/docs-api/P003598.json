The lessons\n            learned indicate that the disbursement ratio of 20 percent\n            for the civil works category, agreed during negotiations,\n            was too low. At one level, project agencies had difficulty\n            coming up with 80 percent in counterpart funds. Cost\n            estimation needs to be improved, as on average contract\n            prices were only about 60 percent of appraisal estimates.\n            Institutional Development assistance would not have the\n            intended benefit, if it is provided before the agencies have\n            the capacity to absorb it, as was the case with the\n            institutional development package for wastewater companies.\n            Successful implementation of financial covenants for cost\n            recovery requires on-going dialogue with provincial and\n            municipal governments throughout the project cycle, and\n            should not be left to the later stages of project\n            implementation. The Liaoning Environmental Fund was only\n            partially successful, even though the loan allocation was\n            increased from $4 million to $6 million. A sound\n            organizational structure to identify, appraise, monitor and\n            administer sub-projects was not established, resulting in\n            the municipal Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs) having\n            to repay the sub-loans on behalf of defaulting enterprises\n            in some 25 percent of the cases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Liaoning Environment
