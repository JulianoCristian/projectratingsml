Some\n            lessons learned included: during the simulation exercise,\n            the threatening pandemic of 2008 and the limited pandemic in\n            2009-2010, the appropriately established lines of\n            communication among main players have proven to be\n            fundamental to the success of the actions. The established\n            hot line for the public has proven to be very helpful and\n            prevented panic. In case of a larger outbreak, coordination\n            will be crucial and will need as short lines of\n            communication as possible. Besides adequate coordination,\n            speed and flexibility plays a dominant role. The appearance\n            of avian influenza strain mobilized and energized the\n            authorities and sped up the set-up of an adequate and fast\n            tracing of suspected cases and immediate response. Shift\n            from avian influenza to H1N1 strain in 2009 demanded prompt\n            response. Fortunately, due to flexibility and quick response\n            of International Development Association (IDA) and other\n            donors this was possible, resulting in a more appropriate\n            and targeted approach. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            need to be streamlined. Too many key indicators for an\n            emergency project can make monitoring and evaluation\n            cumbersome. Data collection and analysis can be an\n            overwhelming task, particularly when there is no full-time\n            staff responsible for it. The project's M&E system\n            could have been simpler, with fewer key indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Avian Influenza Control and Human\n            Pandemic Preparedness and

To achieve this, project support is\n            in three areas: (1) prevention; (2) preparedness and\n            planning; and (3) response and containment. There are three\n            project components. Component 1 has three subcomponents that\n            1) strengthen the regulatory and institutional environment;\n            develop detailed implementation guidelines and manuals as\n            part of a national action and contingency plan; and\n            establish a national compensation policy and fund; and\n            strengthen disease monitoring and containment, diagnostic\n            capacity and disease surveillance, and animal disease\n            information systems; 2) enhance public health program\n            planning and coordination, the national public health\n            surveillance systems, and the health system response\n            capacity; and 3) promote awareness and improve coordination\n            to implement the contingency plans and the National\n
