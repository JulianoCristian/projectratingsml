For the selection of a turnkey\n            design-supply-install contractor under a tight delivery\n            period stricter prequalification criteria should be applied;\n            while restricting competition, only those companies which\n            have experience of similar turnkey contracts implemented\n            within short period and outside of the country of their\n            origin should be prequalified for such contracts. Lack of\n            consistent and close involvement of a qualified social\n            scientist on the team experienced with land acquisition\n            issues both during preparation and especially during\n            implementation resulted in excessive delays in approving the\n            Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) and risked the project becoming\n            out of compliance with a safeguard covenant in the Loan\n            Agreement. This shows that even projects that have limited\n            land acquisition and no relocation of persons still require\n            adequate attention and resources from the Bank's team.\n            It also highlights the importance of upfront technical\n            assistance and capacity building to the client. As with most\n            Bank projects, the development of long relationships with\n            the implementing agency helped to create mutual trust and\n            understanding, which in turn facilitated resolution of\n            problems that arose during the course of project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Moinak Electricity Transmission

There are three\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is construction of transmission lines. It consists\n            of the following sub-components: A) construction of Overhead\n            Transmission Line (OHTL) from Moinak Hydroelectric Power\n            Plant (MHPP) to Shelek Substation (SS): this involves the\n            construction of about 97 km long 220 kV single circuit OHTL;\n            and B) construction of OHTL from MHPP to Robot SS: this\n            involves the construction of about 225 km long 220 kV\n            single-circuit OHTL. The second of the project is\n            modernization of SS. It consists of the following\n            sub-components: A) construction of 220/110 kV Outdoor\n            Switchyard (OSY) at MHPP: the works include the construction\n            with a configuration consisting of double main busbars and\n            transfer bus and installation of circuit breakers,\n            disconnect switches, current and voltage transformers, and\n            lightning over voltage and relay protection systems; B)\n            modernization of 220 kV Robot SS: the works include the\n            reconstruction of the existing 220 kV switching topology and\n            installation of circuit breakers, disconnectors, current and\n            voltage transformers, and lightning over voltage and relay\n            protection systems; and C) modernization of 220 kV Shelek\n            SS: the works include the reconstruction of the existing 220\n            kV switching topology and installation of circuit breakers,\n            disconnectors, current and voltage transformers, and\n            lightning over voltage and relay protection systems. The\n            third component of the project is consulting and technical\n            services. It consists of the following components: A)\n            procurement and project management: this comprises\n            consulting services for procurement and project management,\n            including: the preparation o f bidding documents, assistance\n            in bid evaluation and implementation supervision; and B)\n            technical services: these include support for selection
