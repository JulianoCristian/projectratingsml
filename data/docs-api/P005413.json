The\n            implementation of the project experienced several problems.\n            First of all, the economic setting changed and the\n            Government began to focus on policies for export promotion\n            rather than import substitution, which was the key sector\n            strategy when the EMI project was conceived. Second, in 1983\n            -84 the Government had established a stabilization program\n            to address the economic crisis that had resulted from a\n            large public investment program and from diminished earnings\n            from the export of phosphates, the county's major\n            export commodity. These changes, combined with a subsequent\n            shift in Bank lending from specific industrial sub sectors\n            to more general lines of credit, diverted the attention of\n            the Government and the Bank away from the specific needs of\n            the EMI sub sector. The project experienced delays in\n            effectiveness, in disbursements and in meeting loan\n            conditionality. Furthermore, the Bank did not devote\n            sufficient attention to supervising the project,\n            particularly in relation to the changing needs of the EMI\n            sub sector. There also was some misunderstanding on the part\n            of the Treasury, and within the Bank, concerning the use of\n            the special account."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Electrical
