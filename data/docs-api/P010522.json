Several lessons were gleaned from this\n            project:   Clearly defined implementation modalities and\n            first year activities should be a part of project design and\n            preparation. Fully appraised and staffed project activities\n            ready for implementation should be available for review at\n            project appraisal, and should cover at least the first year\n            of project implementation. Project design should provide a\n            clear strategy on how the intended beneficiaries will be\n            identified, and how they will be involved in planning and\n            implementing project activities. Projects such as this one\n            need to give high priority to monitoring and evaluation and\n            ensure observations are evaluated quickly and feedback is\n            used effectively to modify project design and/or\n            implementation arrangements, when necessary. Supervision\n            team should adopt a flexible and process approach and take\n            corrective measures based on findings of the monitoring and\n            evaluation reports. Good project management and financial\n            management are key facilitating factors for successful\n            project implementation. Towards this, a dedicated and\n            efficient PIU can improve the project performance\n            dramatically. More radical reform of the extension system is\n            needed if farmers are to make best use of new\n            infrastructure, including decentralized planning and\n            funding, collaboration between line departments and\n            partnerships with the private sector. The ability of small\n            farmers to join farm mechanization groups is constrained if\n            access to commercial bank loans is not facilitated.\n            Privately owned and operated shallow tube wells are by far\n            the most efficient and cost effective irrigation method in\n            most areas of Assam. Fish production is a potentially good\n            source of income for marginal farmers and the landless, but\n            well targeted and appropriate market-linked extension and\n            follow-up training is essential to nurture participants and\n            ensure sustainability of both groups and investments.\n            Without adequate attention to animal nutrition and health,\n            and to milk marketing, upgrading of cattle will bring only\n            limited benefits to livestock producers. Building a\n            constituency for community participation takes time and\n            project design must plan for this. Nurturing and training of\n            Nongovernmental organizations is needed if the maximum\n            benefit is to be obtained from their involvement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Assam Rural Infrastructure and\n            Agricultural Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Assam Rural\n            Infrastructure and Agricultural Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5527055/india-assam-rural-infrastructure-agricultural-services-project","projn":"IN-Assam Rural Infra -- P010522","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050103114152"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Extension, agricultural\n            extension services, agricultural growth, agricultural\n            production, agricultural productivity, Agriculture, animal\n            health, animal nutrition, arsenic, banks, Bidding, breeding,\n            capacity building, cattle, climatic conditions, communities,\n            community participation, conservation, cropping, crops,\n            Economic Analysis, economic benefits, economic impact,\n            employment, environmental effects, equipment, Exchange Rate,\n            expenditures, farmer participation, farmers, farming,\n            farming communities, farming systems, farms, feed,\n            fertilizers, Financial Analysis, financial management,\n            financial reporting, fish, fish production, Fisheries,\n            fishing, fluorides, food grains, forestry, forestry sector,\n            fruits, Gender, horticultural crops, households, human\n            capital, impact assessments, income levels, incomes,\n            Infrastructure services, institutional capacity,\n            integration, Irrigation, laboratories, legislation,\n            Livestock, Livestock development, marketing, natural\n            resources, natural resources management, NGOs, pesticides,\n            policy environment, poverty alleviation, Poverty Line,\n            Present Value, private sector, procurement, procurement\n            procedures, public investment, regional agricultural\n            research, resource use, rice, Rural Development, rural\n            income, RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE, rural population, rural\n            poverty, Rural Roads, sustainable resource use, tillers,\n            timber, transportation, vegetables, water systems, weather,\n            weather conditions, Wood"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021378-ASSAM & MADHYA PRADESH\n            AGRICULT.

The project will support:\n            1) the Department of Agriculture's work program,\n            including the extension services for horticulture,\n            fisheries, and livestock to poor rural communities aimed at\n            increasing their production; 2) institutional development\n            (technology generation and extension, seed multiplication\n            and land administration, and planning and coordination); and\n            3) rural infrastructure (small scale irrigation and rural\n            roads). The project will also include a number of studies\n            considered necessary for improving the use of natural\n            resources and the marketing of highly perishable\n
