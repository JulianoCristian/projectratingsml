The chief lesson learned is that\n            continuation of the management and operation of\n            Albania's Power Corporations distribution system is too\n            sensitive to political interference and may not be likely to\n            solve the distribution loss and bill collection problems\n            easily. As the Bank contemplates its future involvement in\n            the sector it probably should: (i) design projects with more\n            concrete results indicators and avoid stretched targets at\n            the national levels; (ii) continue to have targets for\n            performance (Action Plan) because these were very helpful to\n            improve the performance of the sector; and (iii)
