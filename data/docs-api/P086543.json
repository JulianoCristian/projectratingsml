Several lessons from this project were\n            cited, including: 1) Economic crises often open windows of\n            opportunity for reform. 2) Timely assistance can help\n            reform-minded leaders capitalize on such windows of\n            opportunity. 3) Strong ownership on the part of national\n            authorities is a necessary condition. 4) Bank sector work\n            and operations can contribute substantial value-added to\n            economic reform programs. 5)  The excellence of the Bank\n            depends on the commitment, motivation and high quality of\n            its staff. 6)  Valuable synergies can arise from preparing\n            lending operations while simultaneously conducting policy\n            and sector work. 7) The ability to build and maintain\n            complex coalitions of support is key to ensuring the success\n            8) The need to maintain coalitions of support often sets\n            limits on the depth of the reforms, 9) To assert its\n            credibility, a reform-minded administration needs to\n            demonstrate a critical mass of achievements during the\n            initial stage of its mandate.  10) Strong political\n            determination on the part of government officials needs to\n            be sustained over the long haul. 11) Top-down strong\n            political support is necessary to foster leadership on the\n            various fronts of the reform efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Economic Recovery Structural\n            Adjustment Loan

Government's\n            program, to be supported by the Economic Recovery Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project, are to improve public sector\n            management, and fiscal sustainability. These would support a\n            solid economic recovery in the medium-term, that would pave\n            the way for sustained higher growth rates, a return to\n            positive per capita economic growth, and significant poverty\n            reduction. This single-tranche loan supports the\n            presentation to Congress of a budget consistent with\n            attaining a primary surplus for 2004, and financial sector\n            reforms to reduce the fiscal liabilities associated with\n            poor banking resolution practices, and deposit guarantee\n            schemes. The operation also backs the presentation to\n            Congress of major reforms in the tax system, in the public\n            sector pension scheme, and in the customs code, and,\n            supports numerous actions in improving public sector\n            administration, including, but not limited to, the\n            implementation of the newly regulated public procurement\n            law; censuses of public sector employees, and of the\n            contributors and beneficiaries of the public pension scheme;\n            and, the adoption of a financial management action plan to\n            enhance transparency, and strengthen audit, and independent\n            review functions. Nevertheless, a key risk is the absence of\n            a track record in implementing high-quality reforms. The\n            government's reform strategy is an ambitious one, with\n            major reforms to be approved by Congress within a short\n            period of time. Efforts to tackle corruption, and increase\n            efficiency in the public sector figure prominently in this\n            strategy, and could ignite resistance and unrest, possibly\n            resulting in a retreat from, or dilution of, the reform\n            agenda. Mitigating these risks are the new\n            administration's concerted efforts to reach a\n            wide-ranging political consensus for its reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay -
