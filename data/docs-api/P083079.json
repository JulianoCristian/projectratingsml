Some lessons learned includes: financial\n            sector reforms are relatively easy to design but difficult\n            to implement. Successful implementation depends on two\n            crucial factors: the commitment of the authorities to the\n            reform program; and the effectiveness of project\n            supervision. The Egyptian authorities have shown a strong\n            commitment to the multi-year reform program that was\n            designed by the reformist government that was appointed in\n            2004. The reform program did not include the privatization\n            of the two largest commercial banks nor the large insurance\n            companies. However, many measures were taken to improve the\n            management of these institutions, which one commentator\n            resembled to an effective 'privatization of\n            management' rather than 'privatization of\n            ownership'. A dogmatic approach to the ownership\n            question would not be justified, especially after the public\n            rescue of so many leading private banks and insurance\n            companies in high-income countries during the 2008 global\n            financial crisis. Policy based operations may require strong\n            Bank technical assistance efforts as part of the process,\n            particularly in the financial sector. Multi-trenched\n            financial sector adjustment operations are effective\n            instruments to support major financial sector reforms.\n            Achievements under the operations three policy areas thus\n            contributed substantially to the overall development outcome\n            sought by the operation: strengthen the enabling legal and\n            institutional environment for financial intermediation and\n            risk management and to increase the role and participation\n            of the private sector in the provision of financial\n            services. The most relevant lesson of this project is\n            perhaps the importance of the ownership of the reform\n            program by the authorities and their strong commitment to\n            its success. This is underscored by the second component of\n            the operation concerning the restructuring of the ailing\n            specialized public financial institutions. The key lesson\n            from these two projects was the importance of the commitment\n            of the authorities to the reform program, which was most\n            evident prior to and during the project. Without this strong\n            and effective commitment, such significant results could not\n            have been achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt, Morocco and Guatemala - First and\n

Several lessons were cited:\n            1. To ensure that the banking sector privatization runs\n            smoothly, the government  has to \"own\" the\n            initiative. Setting conditions alone id insufficient; the\n            government has to comply with the spirit of the agreement.\n            2. To ensure a smooth transition from a nationalized to\n            privatized bank, ipublic sector banks need to undergo cost\n            and operational restructuring before privatization. 3.\n            Cultural change in the organization must be inculcated prior\n            to privatization. 4. A public sector bank should be\n            recapitalized before privatization or at the point of sale\n            so that it will be able to meet the central bank's\n            minimum capital requirements. Under no circumstances should\n            the supervisory authorities allow regulatory forbearance for\n            the newly privatized bank. 5. Government-related business\n            should not be conveyed to the privatized bank as it is\n            important that the bank begins its operations on a level\n            playing field. 6. The government can expect higher bids for\n            the bank sale if the payment for the bank's shares is\n            injected right back into the bank rather than given to the\n            government as consideration for its existing shares in the\n            bank. 7. Enhanced regulatory and supervisory capacity serves\n            to improve the efficiency of banks and enhances competition\n            among them. Foreign banks and the National Bank of Pakistan\n            (which is still majority government-owned) should be subject\n            to the same regulations as domestic private banks, creating\n            a level playing field in the banking sector. 8. The higher\n            value of the shares in a privatized bank and the broader\n            range of financial products at competitive prices usually\n            offset part of the restructuring costs. 9. Reforms in the\n            rest of the financial sector should keep pace with those in\n            the banking sector. 10. Irrespective of costs, restructuring\n            is necessary to restore the safety and soundness of the\n            financial system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Banking Sector Development

Policy\n            Credit/Loan Project seeks to support the Government of\n            Pakistan towards improving sector governance, through the\n            privatization of the United Bank of Pakistan (UBL), the\n            Habib Bank Ltd. (HBL), and resolution of the Allied Bank of\n            Pakistan (ABL), further strengthening the regulatory and\n            supervisory environment for banking, improving transparency\n            and disclosure, and preventing the possible use of the\n            banking system for money laundering. Both the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the Poverty Reduction strategy\n            Paper (PRSP) recognize the importance of financial sector\n            reforms for accelerating economic growth, and reducing\n            poverty. By and large, the success of reforms stems from the\n            improved legal and regulatory framework, and enhanced\n            corporate governance as a result of the reduced role of\n            government. Profitability and liquidity indicators within\n            commercial banking have shown marked improvements, while the\n            banking sector has also become considerably more competitive\n            and responsive. The project would support further\n            strengthening of the banking sector competitiveness, and its\n            outreach to areas/population with little or no access to\n            banking services. However, there is a risk of policy\n            reversal in the medium term, if access to financial services\n            does not expand to the rural areas, and other traditionally,\n            underserved sectors. The significant growth in credit to the\n            consumer markets poses a risk, thus requiring strengthening\n            of credit appraisal systems, and risk management by the\n            banks, as well as strong monitoring by the regulator. There\n            have been initiatives to promote, and expand credit\n            information services in the private sector, enhancing\n            governance and transparency, as well as improved legal and\n            judicial processes for insolvency bankruptcy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Banking Sector Development Policy\n            Credit/Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Banking Sector\n            Development Policy Credit/Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5543022/pakistan-banking-sector-development-policy-creditloan-project","projn":"PK-Banking Sector Development Policy Credit\n            -- P083079","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Housing Finance","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050112090917"},"subsc":"Banking","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, accounting, acquirers, ADB,\n            aggregate demand, agriculture, Asian Development Bank,\n            assets, balance sheet, balance sheets, bank branches, bank\n            operations, bank privatization, banking crisis, banking\n            reform, Banking Reforms, BANKING SECTOR, BANKING SECTOR\n            DEVELOPMENT, banking sector reforms, banking services,\n            Banking Supervision, banking system, bankruptcy, bankruptcy\n            procedures, banks, base year, benchmark, benchmarks, bonds,\n            capital adequacy, capital formation, capital markets,\n            capital requirements, capitalization, central bank,\n            Certificates, collateral, commercial banks, competitiveness,\n            consolidated supervision, consolidation, Consumer Price\n            Index, consumer protection, contractual savings, corporate\n            governance, Currency, current account, debt, Depository,\n            Deposits, Development Finance, Development Finance\n            Institutions, economic growth, equity markets, excess\n            liquidity, Expenditure, exports, face value, Financial\n            Accountability, financial contracts, financial discipline,\n            financial disclosure, Financial Indicators, financial\n            institutions, financial intermediation, financial market,\n            financial markets, Financial Sector, financial services,\n            financial system, FISCAL YEAR, foreign banks, foreign\n            currency, Foreign Currency Deposits, futures, futures\n            contracts, GDP, Gross Domestic Product, Gross National\n            Savings, guidelines, housing, housing finance, Income,\n            inefficiency, Inflation, Institutional Development,\n            Insurance, integrity, interest payments, interest rate,\n            interest rates, international supervisory standards, IPO,\n            Islamic bank, Islamic banking, Islamic banks, labor unions,\n            laws, leasing, leasing companies, lending practices, local\n            currency, macroeconomic performance, macroeconomic policies,\n            macroeconomic stabilization, margins, market discipline,\n            market risk, maturity, Monetary aggregates, monetary policy,\n            money laundering, mutual fund, mutual funds,\n            nationalization, net worth, offerings, operating losses,\n            pensions, Political interference, private banks,\n            Privatization, problem loans, productivity, Profitability,\n            provincial banks, prudential regulations, public debt,\n            Purchase Price, rating agencies, Real GDP, regulatory\n            framework, regulatory powers, Retirement, risk management,\n            Savings, Securities, Settlement, Settlement System,\n            Settlement Systems, shareholding, specialized banks, state\n            intervention, state ownership, stock exchanges,\n            subsidiaries, taxation, Term Finance, trade barriers, transparency,"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"30847"},"facets":{}}}
