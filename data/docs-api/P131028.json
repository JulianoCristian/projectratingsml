Some lessons learned included: the\n            programmatic development policy instrument proved to have\n            weaknesses in context of this operation. The design of the\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) system needs to ensure\n            that the set of indicators are properly defined, ensuring\n            clarity of measuring methods, data collection, and\n            availability of baseline.

The indicator on training to promoters\n            for family support was based on an activity that the\n            government needed to scale up after piloting.

Directors expressed support for the DPL which\n            would help to increase access to and quality of social\n            services for the poor. Directors stressed the importance of\n            capacity building, monitoring and evaluation in the\n            newly-created Ministry of Inclusion. Going forward,\n            Directors encouraged the authorities to continue improving\n            the targeting of social programs to address disparities.\n            Directors also emphasized the importance of capturing and\n            sharing the lessons learned from this consolidation of\n            social programs and improvements in their inclusiveness and\n            effectiveness. Finally, Directors acknowledged close\n            collaboration with development partners and encouraged\n            inclusion of the private sector and civil society in\n            preparation of the operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - First Social Inclusion Development\n            Policy Loan Project : chair's summary of discussion"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - First Social Inclusion\n            Development Policy Loan Project : chair's summary of discussion"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/12/17097151/peru-first-social-inclusion-development-policy-loan-project-chairs-summary-discussion","projn":"PE-Social Inclusion Dpl -- P131028","docty":"Board Summary","subtopic":"Social Cohesion,Poverty and Social Impact Analysis,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Corporate Law,Civil Society","teratopic":"Social Development,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20121220014223"},"theme":"Managing for development results,Social safety nets,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Other human development,Nutrition and food security","subsc":"General education sector,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"capacity building, civil society,\n            consolidation, development partners, Development Policy,\n            private sector, Social Inclusion, social programs, social\n            services, targeting"}},"owner":"Social Protection Sector (LCSHS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Human development,Social protection and risk management","repnb":"74473"},"17086762":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/11/17086762/peru-social-inclusion-development-policy-loan-program","available_in":"Spanish,English","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"Spanish","entityid":"000333037_20130418123725","node_id":"17086762"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/11/17086762/peru-social-inclusion-development-policy-loan-program","new_url":"2012/11/17086762/peru-social-inclusion-development-policy-loan-program","disclosure_date":"2012-12-17T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-12-17T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-12-17T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/12/18/000386194_20121218002546/Rendered/INDEX/NonAsciiFileName0.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/12/18/000386194_20121218002546/Rendered/PDF/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf","datestored":"2012-12-18T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-11-13T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Revised buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309940","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Peru - Social Inclusion of Development\n            Policy Loan Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objectives of the Social\n            Inclusion of Development Policy Loan Program for Peru are\n            (i) supporting the institutionalization of the stewardship\n            of the social inclusion agenda under Ministry of Women and\n            Social Development (MIDIS); (ii) laying the foundations for\n            improving the inclusiveness and effectiveness of key social\n            programs implemented by MIDIS; and (iii) developing adequate\n            systems and strategies for targeting, monitoring and\n            evaluation, and overall coordination.
