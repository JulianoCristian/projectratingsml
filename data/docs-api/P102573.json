Both the Bank\n            and the Borrower received moderately satisfactory\n            performance ratings. A restructuring took place during the\n            project that affected the following: A Supplemental Letter\n            (Performance Indicators) was included at the time of\n            restructuring because of limited progress on developing a\n            regulatory and quality assurance framework and some\n            indicators and targets were too ambitious or could not be\n            measured. Other key changes made include: (i) scope of\n            Component 1 was revised to make it achievable; (ii) results\n            indicators and targets were revised to make them realistic\n            and measurable; (iii) covenants were added to improve the\n            implementation of a governance framework; (iv) covenants\n            were added to strengthen actions to ensure compliance; (v)\n            closing date was extended by 16 months; (vi) a pilot voucher\n            program was added; and (vii) training of additional\n            vulnerable persons and new training of rehabilitated\n            injectable drug users (IDUs) were added under Component 3.\n            There were six lessons recorded from this project and they\n            are: (1) Strong commitment and leadership are critical for\n            successfully steering reforms in a Technical and Vocational\n            Education and Training (TVET) institute.

(4) Progress on\n            improving gender equity is feasible even in situations with\n            substantial cultural constraints. (5) Timely project\n            restructuring can play a pivotal role in improving project\n            implementation.

Under Taliban rule (1996-2001), the\n            country was plagued by continuing conflict, and\n            international isolation. The education system was virtually\n            dismantled. Girls were officially excluded from the system.\n            Boys in school were taught a curriculum limited to religious\n            content. After the fall of Taliban in 2001, more and more\n            Afghan families returned home after living the war years as\n            refugees in neighboring countries. As a result village\n            populations across the country have swelled and there was\n            increased demand for education. Recognizing that education\n            would play a vital role in the reconstruction and\n            development of Afghanistan, World Bank\u2019s International\n            Development Association along with other international\n            partners launched a series of education programs aimed at\n            providing access and quality education at all levels with a\n            focus on girls. Specifically, these programs aimed to\n            reconstruct the education sector across the country. Since\n            2001, the projects have brought new life to education and\n            particularly benefited girls. Girls\u2019 enrollment skyrocketed\n            from 839,000 to more than 2.2 million, and boys\u2019 from 2.6\n            million to 3.9 million, the highest enrollment in the\n            history of Afghanistan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan girls' schools -
