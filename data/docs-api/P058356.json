Lessons convey that while the Bank was\n            responsive to the Government's request for support, it\n            may have underestimated the need to build stronger consensus\n            in favor of the project, where an improved loan design would\n            have better ensured implementation. Thus, a more explicit,\n            and carefully planned programmatic approach could have been\n            one option, provided an interim CAS, or an update, had been\n            prepared as an instrument for seeking Board discussion and\n            approval; another option (not exclusive from the preceding)\n            could have been to find mechanisms to build broad consensus\n            over the project's framework, such as open forums to\n            discuss the operational scope, but, this could have weighed\n            against extra time, likely delaying the required timeframe;\n            moreover, a follow-up technical assistance operation, could\n            have added consistency, and efficiency, by enhancing\n            institutional capacity, which should have helped the new\n            government in the preparation of broad economic and social\n            reform agenda; additionally, another option could have been\n            to make this operation a much more focused instrument, by\n            concentrating the policy, and reform agenda, on the issue of\n            medium-term fiscal adjustment, and institutional/structural\n
