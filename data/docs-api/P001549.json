The Bank took a\n            leading role in promoting essential sectoral adjustment, and\n            was flexible on project restructuring. While the\n            Borrower's performance is also rated satisfactory,\n            corrective actions were slow to be implemented. The key\n            lessons convey that, regarding the nature of the project,\n            policy reforms and investments, were appropriate measures to\n            achieve project objectives, which provided the suitable\n            incentives for private development. This success was highly\n            dependent upon the Government's commitment towards\n            divestiture, although the aid suspension from the Caisse\n            Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE), affected the\n            whole sector, conducive in part, to insufficient local\n            budgets, since, adequate counterpart funding is critical for\n            project implementation. Furthermore, the absence of\n            effective project management, and accountability, also\n            affected the extensive beef production component, both\n            essential elements for a successful implementation. Although\n            the Mid-term review was effective in enabling corrective\n            actions, particularly in enhancing beneficiary\n            participation, severe constraints, such as creditworthiness,\n            and road accessibility, hindered both rural, and private\n            development. Bush fires remain a complex issue, to be\n            addressed on a multi-sectoral approach, outside the\n            project's scope."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Livestock Sector

The main policy reforms are :i)\n            encouragement of farmers associations to take over\n            responsibilities such as feed mixing and distribution,\n            fodder seed multiplication, cattle breed improvement and\n            milk collection; and ii) the incentive framework should\n            allow market-based competition, requiring that suitable\n            pricing mechanisms be established for dairy products\n            imported under food aid or subsidized surpluses.  The\n            institution strengthening component would promote private\n            veterinary practice and review and reform formal training in\n            livestock and veterinary science.  The production\n            development component would include support to cattle\n            production systems, mainly through improved disease control;\n            dairy development in the

- Livestock Sector Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ultimate objective of the project is\n            to increase livestock output in order to reverse a\n            potentially alarming demand/supply situation, as well as to\n            promote exports.  The project would consist of a package of\n            policy and institutional reforms, supported by two\n            components, one for institution building and one for\n            production development.  The main policy reforms are :i)\n            encouragement of farmers associations to take over\n            responsibilities such as feed mixing and distribution,\n            fodder seed multiplication, cattle breed improvement and\n            milk collection; and ii) the incentive framework should\n            allow market-based competition, requiring that suitable\n            pricing mechanisms be established for dairy products\n            imported under food aid or subsidized surpluses.  The\n            institution strengthening component would promote private\n            veterinary practice and review and reform formal training in\n            livestock and veterinary science.  The production\n            development component would include support to cattle\n            production systems, mainly through improved disease control;\n            dairy development in the central highlands by strengthening\n            dairy producers associations and improving milk collection."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Projet sectoriel elevage"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar \u2013 Projet sectoriel\n            \u00e9levage : Madagascar\u00a0- Projet sectoriel d\u2019\u00e9levage"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/04/12675022/madagascar-livestock-sector-project-madagascar-projet-sectoriel-elevage","projn":"MG-Livestock -- P001549","subtopic":"Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Madagascar","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100820052520"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Animal production","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Animal production; Dairy cattle; Dairy\n            industry; Institution building; Livestock; Veterinary services,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Animal production; Dairy cattle; Dairy\n            industry; Institution building; Livestock; Veterinary services,,"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 2 (AFTS2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF023975-FAC CONSULTANT TRUST FUND - NEW,TF022065-LIVESTOCK SECTOR PROJECT","repnb":"9424","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Projet sectoriel elevage"}}},"facets":{}}}
