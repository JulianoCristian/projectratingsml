Some\n            lessons learned included: the need for an implementing\n            agency is dictated by the lack of MoPE capacities to\n            implement a project given its current structure and staffing\n            levels, as well as the different fiduciary procedures\n            followed by the Government and the Bank. Under BEP-2,\n            instead of creating a PIU, the project hired a team of\n            consultants who were to support MoPE and MoF departments,\n            with the departments having direct implementation\n            responsibility for the components. Attention to developing\n            sustainable institutional and budgetary arrangements for\n            innovations should be built into project design and\n            implementation. The purpose of learning assessments should\n            be defined, and the approach designed accordingly. One of\n            the key factors impeding the institutionalization of\n            standardized assessments is the absence of a clearly defined\n            assessment strategy. While the project implemented\n            sample-based testing, the MoPE was focusing its effort to\n            monitor system performance using an existing monitoring tool\n            without thinking through the purpose of different assessment\n            instruments. Countries that have a functioning assessment\n            system should have a balance between summative and formative assessments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uzbekistan - Second Phase of the Basic\n
