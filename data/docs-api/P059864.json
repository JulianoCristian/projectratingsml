Second Rural Transport Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Rural Transport Project (RT2)\n            of Vietnam had the following ratings: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. The lessons learned included: 1)\n            The key procurement lesson learnt from RT2 is the need to\n            support Vietnam's development and adherence to a modern\n            competitive procurement practice, one that leads to\n            transparency and accountability; 2) Future operations should\n            adopt a more flexible approach, based on improved national\n            standards, to provide greater technical guidance to\n            provinces on standards and surface specification. Further\n            work also needs to be done to monitor the trials and\n            complete the economic analysis to support these decisions\n            and undertake trials in the three remaining geographic areas\n            of Vietnam; 3) Institutional development can only be\n            effective when based on a sound analysis of the\n            institutional mandates, incentives and capacity of the\n            agencies responsible for rural transport in Vietnam; 4) The\n            long term international consultants had limited impact due\n            to their central location and a lack of local knowledge and\n            language skills. Future projects should rely more on local\n            consultants based regionally; 5) Based on RT2 experience a\n            network approach to maintenance should be adopted that\n            provides provinces with clear incentives to increase\n            recurrent financing to ensure sufficient maintenance\n            funding; and 6) The development of the private sector was\n            particularly successful primarily because it focused on\n            providing a market for small-scale contractors. This\n            approach should be continued in future."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Second Rural Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Second Rural Transport Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/8003783/vietnam-second-rural-transport-project","projn":"VN-Second Rural Transport Project -- P059864","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Roads & Transport,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Housing & Human Habitats,Roads & Highways,Rural Transport","teratopic":"Rural Development,Transport,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070731101740"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Transport,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access roads, accessibility, agricultural\n            value, axle loads, basic access, basic access road, basic\n            access roads, basic road access, bicycle, bicycle ownership,\n            bicycles, bottlenecks, bridge, bridges, buses, capacity\n            building, car, clinics, communes, construction, Cost benefit\n            analysis, cost effectiveness, crossings, Department of\n            Transport, District roads, Districts, drainage, dust,\n            economic development, Engineer, flooding, Framework,\n            freight, freight services, Gender, Gravel, gravel haulage,\n            gravel roads, gravel surface, high transport, Highway,\n            highways, hospitals, income, Infrastructure Development,\n            inhabitants, Inland Waterways, interventions, journey, Land\n            acquisition, Length of Roads, local authorities, local\n            contractors, local knowledge, Local Transport, material\n            quality, means of transport, Ministry of Transport,\n            mobility, motorcycle, motorcycles, motorized transport, Net\n            Present Value, Pacific Region, passengers, paved roads,\n            pavement, Pedestrians, periodic maintenance, PIARC, Private\n            Road, rain, reduction in travel, reinforcement, research\n            projects, Resettlement, Road, Road Administration, road\n            construction, road costs, road development, Road\n            Engineering, road improvements, road investment, road\n            length, road links, road maintenance, road management, road\n            network, Road Networks, road projects, road safety, road\n            standards, Road Surfacing, road user, road users, road\n            works, Roads, roughness, Routine maintenance, rural access,\n            rural accessibility, rural areas, rural communities, Rural\n            Development, rural households, Rural Infrastructure, Rural\n            Road, rural road access, Rural Road Construction, rural road\n            improvements, rural road investments, rural road\n            maintenance, rural road network, rural road projects, rural\n            road rehabilitation, rural roads, RURAL TRANSPORT, rural\n            transport development, rural transport investments, rural\n            transport policies, rural transport sector, rural transport\n            services, Rural Transport Strategy, sealing, sharing, Slope\n            Stability, span, structures, Terrain, traffic, Traffic\n            composition, Traffic count, traffic counts, traffic data,\n            traffic flows, traffic growth, traffic levels, traffic\n            volume, traffic volumes, transparency, transport activities,\n            transport authorities, transport budgets, transport costs,\n            transport expenditure, transport investment, transport\n            investments, transport modes, transport network, transport\n            policies, Transport Sector, transport services, transport\n            strategies, Transport Strategy, transportation, travel time,\n            Travel times, trucks, vehicle, vehicle operating, vehicle\n            operating costs, vehicles, village areas, walking"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF023656-RURAL TRANSPORT PROJECT II,TF025576-PHRD-SECOND RURAL TRANSPORT PROJECT,TF034859-VIETNAM -
