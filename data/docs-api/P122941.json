Some lessons learned included:\n            timely capacity assistance through adequate coordination\n            with other sector operations and other donors is critical to\n            improve government\u0092s capacity to implement reforms. Although\n            technical assistance is critical to support the\n            implementation of reforms, it is not always sufficient for\n            entrenching change in national processes. The design of\n            reforms must also complement the existing capacities, be of\n            relevance from a political economy perspective, and be\n            tailored to the existing practicalities. Additional\n            consensus may be warranted when implementing reforms that\n            touch upon the power sharing between the Island governments\n            and the Union. Better understanding should foster trust\n            among the parties and help move the agenda forward. Bank\n            supervision needs to follow up with the government more\n            closely regarding the steps they need to take to achieve the\n            indicators supported by the

Directors\n            stressed the need to keep the momentum for reform through\n            consistent and deepened engagement. Directors also\n            acknowledged the country's very limited institutional\n            capacity and underscored the importance of stronger\n            collaboration among all donors to provide a substantial mass\n            of coordinated interventions. Finally, Directors commended\n            the Government's progress on macroeconomic and fiscal\n            stabilization, including progress towards the Heavily\n            Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) completion point, and welcomed\n            the progress achieved on key structural reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Economic Reform Development Policy\n            Grant Project : summary of discussion"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comoros - Economic Reform\n            Development Policy Grant Project : summary of discussion"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/11/17041655/comoros-economic-reform-development-policy-grant-project-summary-discussion","projn":"KM-Comoros Development Policy Grant 2 -- P122941","docty":"Board Summary","subtopic":"Poverty and Trade,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Social Accountability,Corporate Law,Achieving Shared Growth","teratopic":"Social Development,International Economics and Trade,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development","count":"Comoros","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20121206001007"},"theme":"Other accountability/anti-corruption,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,International Economics and Trade,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, collaboration, Development\n            Policy, Economic Reform, institutional capacity, limited,\n            poverty reduction, state-owned enterprises, structural\n            reforms, transparency, Union"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 1 (AFTP1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance","repnb":"74179"},"16928789":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/10/16928789/comoros-economic-reform-development-policy-grant-program","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/10/16928789/comoros-economic-reform-development-policy-grant-program","new_url":"2012/10/16928789/comoros-economic-reform-development-policy-grant-program","disclosure_date":"2012-12-07T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-12-07T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-12-07T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/11/08/000386194_20121108005417/Rendered/INDEX/723920PGD0P1220Official0Use0Only090.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/11/08/000386194_20121108005417/Rendered/PDF/723920PGD0P1220Official0Use0Only090.pdf","credit_no":"Q802","datestored":"2012-11-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-10-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Economic Reform Development\n            Policy Grant Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the\n            Economic Reform Development Policy Grant Program is to\n            strengthen state transparency and accountability, thereby\n            addressing some of the underlying causes of fragility in\n            Comoros. This program document states an Economic Reform\n            Grant, a stand-alone development policy operation (DPO), to\n            the Union of the Comoros. The single tranche DPO, in the\n            amount of SDR 3.3 million (US$5 million equivalent),\n            supports the implementation of core reforms in\n            Comoros's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy\n            (PRGSP), at a time when the country is aiming at reaching\n            the Completion Point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted\n            Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC CP) by end 2012. A previous\n            DPO, the Economic Governance Reform Support Grant (EGRSG),\n            in an amount of US$3 million equivalent, was approved by the\n            Board on June 1, 2010 and disbursed in October 2010. In the\n            politically difficult context of the late 2010 elections,\n            slower than expected implementation of reforms and slippage\n            in macroeconomic performance resulted in delays in the\n            preparation of the planned second DPO. Since mid-2011, the\n            authorities have rekindled the reform process, taken steps\n            to bring the budget under control, and shown a renewed\n            commitment to advancing on structural and institutional\n            reforms. The main goal of the operation is to support\n            government-owned reforms in four out of the six axes spelled\n            out in the country's PRGSP, namely (i) axis one, on\n            economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing\n            improvements in fiscal policy and public financial\n            management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by\n            focusing on institution-building and ensuring a broader role\n            for the private sector, with this operation's focus on\n            the electricity sector; (iii) axis three, on strengthening\n            governance and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in\n            core government personnel management systems and stepping up\n            the fight against corruption and fostering transparency in\n            the issuance of fishing licenses and agreements; and (iv)\n            axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and\n            civilian security, emphasizing disaster risk management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Economic Reform Development Policy\n            Grant Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comoros -
