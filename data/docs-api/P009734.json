This second impact evaluation covers\n            four projects, two in India and one each in Bangladesh and\n            Pakistan. In concept, these four projects were modeled on\n            the Indian Tarai project, which was the subject of the\n            previous evaluation. An important issue for this impact\n            evaluation is the extent to which the leading role assigned\n            to the public sector in these projects has affected the\n            emergence of the private seed industry. The evaluation\n            concludes that the development strategy followed by the\n            Governments and the Bank worked well. The initial injection\n            of training and expertise to assist the public sector\n            provided the basis for private sector development.\n            Decentralization of the seed parastatals in India and\n            Pakistan helped defuse potential opposition to the growth of\n            the private sector. And the Bank's initial support of\n            the public sector has assured it a 'seat at the\n            table' from which to argue for a level-playing field\n            for the private sector. The most successful aspects of these\n            projects were usually training and the creation of\n            institutions for seed testing and certification."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh, India, Pakistan - Seeds Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh, India, Pakistan -\n            Seeds Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/441904/bangladesh-india-pakistan-seeds-projects","projn":"BD-Cereal Seeds -- P009361,PK-Seeds -- P010094,IN-National Seeds II -- P009734,IN-National Seeds I -- P009703","docty":"Impact Evaluation Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Geographical Information Systems,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Pakistan,India,Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961029212113"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing,(Historic)Annual crops","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,audits,Beneficiaries,breeding,Centre,Cereals,CIMMYT,cooperatives,Cotton,crops,Dates,FAO,Farm,farm\n            storage,farmer,farmers,Farms,genetic research,germ\n            plasm,Grain,Grain Prices,Green Revolution,high yield\n            varieties,housing,hybrids,HYV,institutional\n            development,IRRI,livestock,Maize,Operations,Paddy,Private\n            Sector,produce,professions,Project Completion,public\n            sector,Rice,Rice Research,Seed,Seed Certification,Seed\n            Companies,seed industry,seed marketing,seed policy,Seed\n            Production,seed testing,Seeds,Supervision,Sustainability,weeds,Wheat,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,audits,Beneficiaries,breeding,Centre,Cereals,CIMMYT,cooperatives,Cotton,crops,Dates,FAO,Farm,farm\n            storage,farmer,farmers,Farms,genetic research,germ\n            plasm,Grain,Grain Prices,Green Revolution,high yield\n            varieties,housing,hybrids,HYV,institutional\n            development,IRRI,livestock,Maize,Operations,Paddy,Private\n            Sector,produce,professions,Project Completion,public\n            sector,Rice,Rice Research,Seed,Seed Certification,Seed\n            Companies,seed industry,seed marketing,seed policy,Seed\n            Production,seed testing,Seeds,Supervision,Sustainability,weeds,Wheat,Yields"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"14761"},"724868":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/06/724868/india-first-second-national-seed-projects","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/06/724868/india-first-second-national-seed-projects","new_url":"1987/06/724868/india-first-second-national-seed-projects","disclosure_date":"2007-07-15T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/27/000009265_3960924192844/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/27/000009265_3960924192844/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"1273","credit_no":"0816","datestored":"1999-07-27T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1987-06-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - First and Second National Seed Projects"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This is the Project Completion Report\n            (PCR) for the First and Second National Seeds Projects in\n            India. The basic objective of the two projects was therefore\n            to continue to ensure that the availability of High Yield\n            Variety (HYV) seed nationwide will not be a constraint to\n            agricultural development, by further developing the\n            institutional structure of the seed industry and adding to\n            the existing seed processing capacity. Lessons learned are\n            as follows: (a) It is clear that in order to stimulate\n            and/or maintain demand seeds of the self-pollinated\n            varieties, new varieties meeting farmer's requirements,\n            should become available on a frequent basis. (b) It is also\n            clear that seed replacement rates used to calculate seed\n            demand have been overly optimistic, resulting in excessive\n            investment in seed processing capacity. It should be\n            recognized most of the production of seed of self-pollinated\n            varieties will continue to be produced by the farmer's\n            themselves or transferred between farmers. (c) The\n            implementation experience also suggests that in order to\n            develop an effective and efficient industry it is necessary\n            to conceptualize and clearly define the roles of public and\n            private sector involvement in the industry given its special\n            characteristics. Conclusions drawn from the projects are as\n            follows: The Projects have created infrastructure and ample\n            capacity to meet likely seed demand over the next few years.\n            However pits' is likely that some of the processing\n            plants are not satisfactorily located geographically\n            ecologically. Also the existing spare capacity is under the\n            control of State agencies that may not always be aware of or\n            able to fulfill national requirements. While the projects\n            have not succeeded in generating the economic returns\n            forecast at appraisal they have helped GOI identify a number\n            of key issues in the definition of the policies and\n            institutional frame work governing public sector performance\n            in India's important seed industry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - First and Second
