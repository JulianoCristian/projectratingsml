Some lessons learned\n            included: one of the most important elements of\n            Rwanda's commitment was its poverty strategy, which\n            emphasized inclusion of the poor and the vulnerable within\n            communities, associations, cooperatives, etc. With respect\n            to HIV/AIDS, the strategy's focus on vulnerable\n            populations rather than individuals is viewed as one of the\n            main reasons for the decline in the stigma associated with\n            HIV/AIDS. With respect to the support for income-generating\n            activities, the emphasis on associations of People Living\n            with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) has not guaranteed success, but\n            has contributed to many of the successes. Conversely, where\n            efforts concentrated on individuals (payment of school fees\n            for selected students), many of the problems seen in other\n            Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program (MAP) have occurred. While\n            the Bank is often criticized for its slow and complex\n            procedures, the MAP demonstrated several of its comparative\n            advantages, particularly its flexibility and willingness to\n            support Government strategies. In particular, interviewees\n            cited the Bank's early willingness: (i) to address\n            treatment and care holistically through measures to\n            strengthen health systems and health personnel; (ii) to\n            support the Government's policy of decentralizing\n            services and program coordination; and (iii) to promote\n            Government initiatives to consolidate procurement, test and\n            scale up performance-based financing, and improve health\n            care financing through mutuelles. In a number of these\n            instances, interviewees noted that the Bank's\n            non-financial support was at least as essential as its\n            financial support for persuading other partners."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS

Access to AIDS\n            care and treatment has expanded to rural areas where the\n            majority of Rwandans live on less than U.S. $.70 per day and\n            HIV infections rates among youth in Rwanda has declined. The\n            main challenge at this stage is to use the recently approved\n            U.S. 10 million dollars grant to consolidate and sustain the\n            gains from the initial investments and to develop a\n            long-term financing strategy for HIV and AIDS."},"docna":{"cdata!":"A comprehensive approach to HIV and AIDS\n            yields results in Rwanda"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"A comprehensive approach to HIV\n            and AIDS yields results in Rwanda"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2007/04/24014605/comprehensive-approach-hiv-aids-yields-results-rwanda","count":"Rwanda","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"AIDS care, AIDS epidemic, AIDS patients,\n            AIDS program, AIDS Relief, Civil society organizations,\n            condoms, disease, Disease Control, fashion, females, health\n            centers, health insurance, HIV, HIV infection, HIV infection\n            rates, HIV infections, HIV prevention, HIV testing,\n            HIV/AIDS, hospitals, income, Malaria, orphans, sexual\n            transmission, society, therapy, treatment, Tuberculosis,\n            UNAIDS, vulnerable children, youth"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social protection and risk management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Un enfoque integral hacia el VIH/SIDA\n            arroja resultados en Rwanda"}},"topic":"Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Promotion and Disease Prevention\n            m1326336 1458,HIV/AIDS and Education m1326805 1542,HIV and AIDS m1327522 1416,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397","projn":"RW-Multi-Sectoral Hiv/Aids Project -\n            Additional Financing -- P104189,RW-Multi-Sectoral Hiv/Aids Project -- P071374","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"HIV AIDS,Disability,Gender and Health,Health Systems Development & Reform,Disease Control & Prevention","teratopic":"Social Protections and Labor,Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150218125837"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","theme":"Gender,Social Inclusion,Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services,Population and reproductive health,Participation and civic engagement,HIV/AIDS","colti":"IDA at work ;

The proposed additional grant would\n            help finance the costs associated with an unanticipated\n            financing gap and would consolidate the gains from the\n            initial investments, focusing on interventions with the most\n            significant impact with regard to HIVIAIDS prevention,\n            treatment and care.
