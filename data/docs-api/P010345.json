The project achieved its objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was partially\n            successful, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, promotion of the\n            private sector in the production and operation of power\n            plants remains an attractive option to meet the growing\n            demand for power in Pakistan. Second, to promote efficient\n            project management, appropriate powers and responsibilities\n            should be delegated to senior managers of WAPDA. Third,\n            administrative procedures that hinder efficient project\n            implementation should be amended for externally financed\n            projects. Fourth, efficiency, economy, and transparency of\n            procurement administration needs to be institutionalized in\n            WAPDA. Fifth, adequate budget provision should be made to\n            meet operational requirements, and efforts to mobilize\n            revenue should be enhanced. Finally, structured training for\n            senior, middle, and operational staff should be agreed upon\n            at the start of a project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Transmission Extension and\n            Reinforcement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Transmission Extension\n            and Reinforcement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731884/pakistan-transmission-extension-reinforcement-project","projn":"PK-Trans.
