Overall,\n            those investments that reached farmers (genetics, local\n            pasture leasing, private veterinary care, and selected local\n            cooperatives) are considered sustainable and may further\n            expand. Investments that depend on government funding are\n            more tenuous, as budget support is insecure and governmental\n            institutions are prone to interference. Bank performance is\n            rated satisfactory overall. Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory: Overall, the Borrower's performance can\n            be characterized as ambivalent, from a period where the\n            Government wanted to close the project, to periods of solid\n            support. Moreover, substantial differences of opinion\n            between MAWRPI (the designated implementation agency) and\n            the Ministry of Finance (MoF) regarding project direction\n            and implementation led to much uncertainty, many delays and,\n            finally, to MoF involving itself in technical issues outside\n            the professional competence of the concerned staff, which\n            caused further delays. Lessons learned included the\n            following: 1) Sectoral investment during a time of major\n            farm restructuring or institutional reform, where the\n            outcome is by no means clear, carries a substantial risk of\n            making wrong investment decisions. In this particular case,\n            many project beneficiaries were still undergoing changes in\n            physical and legal asset ownership, and the shape of the\n            industry substantially changed during implementation.\n            Consequently, some investments identified at appraisal were\n            not feasible. 2) The project was appraised in a country that\n            was used to a centrally planned investment climate, and that\n            paradigm persisted in many minds and in the procedures of\n            the implementing agencies. Ministries, stakeholders and the\n            general public were not well informed about development in\n            general, or about the specific development objectives of the\n            project. This was later somewhat corrected, but most early\n            project investments appear to have focused on supporting\n            state farms. 3) Flexibility in implementation greatly helped\n            to overcome some of the weaknesses of design. Such\n            flexibility is highly recommended for investment projects\n            during transition, because it allows time and room for\n            learning while doing. 4) The international technical\n            assistance for establishing project management capacity in a\n            country without such experience proved valuable, with\n            benefits that extended to subsequent IDA-funded projects in\n            MAWRPI and other ministries. 5) Investment in hardware\n            (laboratory equipment, liquid nitrogen machine, etc.)\n            without investment in operating skills leads to procurement\n            of goods that are either not suitable or are under-utilized\n            and as such a waste or resources. 6) long term commitment to\n            inexperienced consultants should be avoided, and (ii)\n            Employment of consultants to work with institutions that\n            they worked for in the immediate past should be designed\n            with care to avoid conflict of interest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Sheep and Wool Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Sheep and Wool\n

and wool farming; 2) privatize the provision of\n            several services to farmers, including wool marketing and\n            veterinary services; and 3) improve the management and\n            conservation of natural grazing resources by farmers. To\n            achieve these objectives, the project will focus on: 1)\n            organizing sheep and wool farmers into farmers'\n            associations or groups through which essential services can\n            be channeled; 2) developing a competitive marketing\n            structure with incentives for production of quality lambs\n            and wool for premium prices; 3) increasing sheep and wool\n            productivity through establishing training and advisory\n            services for private farmers and supporting selected\n            breeding activities; and 4) developing and disseminating\n            sustainable pasture management techniques among sheep\n            producers. The project consists of three main components: 1)\n            sheep private enterprise development, including: (a) sheep\n            producers' groups/associations; (b) regional sheep\n            breeders associations; (c) Kyrgyz sheep breeders\n            associations; (d) wool and lamb marketing; and (e) wool\n            testing; 2) development of livestock support services, which\n            comprises: (a) project implementation unit; (b) agricultural\n            training and advisory services; and (c) animal health\n            services; and 3) sheep breeding research support involving\n            sheep breeding research and pastures land resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Sheep Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic -
