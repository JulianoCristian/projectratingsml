The\n            project aims to assist BNDE in (i) providing continuing\n            support for the development of the industrial sector in\n            Morocco, both with respect to the private and public sector\n            as well as (ii) expanding its promotional and development\n            efforts, with emphasis on labor-intensive small-scale\n            industries (SSI). To accomplish this objective, the loan\n            provides US$5 million for a pilot project for the promotion\n            of small-scale industries. In addition, the project aspires\n            to help the institution in (iii) mobilizing additional\n            resources, particularly in the international market; and\n            (iv) strengthening its institutional appraisal capabilities,\n            particularly with respect to larger and more complex\n            projects, in line with the demands made on BNDE by the\n            evolving trend of industrial development in Morocco."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Eighth Banque Nationale Pour Le\n            Developpement Economique (BNDE) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Eighth Banque Nationale\n            Pour Le Developpement Economique (BNDE) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1977/04/727270/morocco-eighth-banque-nationale-pour-le-developpement-economique-bnde-project","projn":"MA-Bnde VIII (Dfc) -- P005379","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101911561717"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,auditors,balance of\n            payments,Balance Sheets,Bank loans,bidding,bonds,book\n            value,borrower,borrowing,borrowings,capacity\n            utilization,capital gains,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,Commitment,debt,development banks,Development\n            Finance,Disbursement,Disbursement\n            procedures,disbursements,dividends,economic rate of\n            return,Economic Situation,employment,equity\n            investments,expenditures,exports,Financial Data,financial\n            institutions,financial services,FINANCIAL STRUCTURE,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fishing,Forecasts,foreign capital,foreign\n            currency,foreign exchange,foreign shareholders,free\n            limit,GDP,Government loans,government securities,growth\n            potential,growth rate,housing,Income,Income\n            Statements,inflation,inflation rate,Interest\n            Rates,laws,lending rate,liquidation,LOAN,loan agreement,loan\n            amount,loan approvals,loan commitments,loan financing,loan\n            investments,maturities,Net profit,nominal interest\n            rate,Ownership Structure,portfolio,profitability,public\n            enterprises,quality standards,resource\n            mobilization,savings,savings banks,special\n            reserve,subborrowers,subloans,suppliers,Transport,value added"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,auditors,balance of\n            payments,Balance Sheets,Bank loans,bidding,bonds,book\n            value,borrower,borrowing,borrowings,capacity\n            utilization,capital gains,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,Commitment,debt,development banks,Development\n            Finance,Disbursement,Disbursement\n            procedures,disbursements,dividends,economic rate of\n            return,Economic Situation,employment,equity\n            investments,expenditures,exports,Financial Data,financial\n            institutions,financial services,FINANCIAL STRUCTURE,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fishing,Forecasts,foreign capital,foreign\n            currency,foreign exchange,foreign shareholders,free\n            limit,GDP,Government loans,government securities,growth\n            potential,growth rate,housing,Income,Income\n            Statements,inflation,inflation rate,Interest\n            Rates,laws,lending rate,liquidation,LOAN,loan agreement,loan\n            amount,loan approvals,loan commitments,loan financing,loan\n            investments,maturities,Net profit,nominal interest\n            rate,Ownership Structure,portfolio,profitability,public\n            enterprises,quality standards,resource\n            mobilization,savings,savings banks,special\n            reserve,subborrowers,subloans,suppliers,Transport,value added"}},"owner":"Private Sector Dev & Finance Grp (MNSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"1505"},"facets":{}}}
