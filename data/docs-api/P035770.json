It is important to\n            reinforce emergency reconstruction operations should not be\n            combined with broad sectoral policy reform efforts. This\n            project is a good example of a well conceived post-conflict\n            reconstruction operation. However, the project's\n            experience supports the guidance provided in OP/BP 8.50 on\n            emergency operations, by showing how difficult it is to\n            implement urgently needed rehabilitation investments, while\n            simultaneously pursuing broader policy reforms in a number\n            of sectors. Sectoral objectives require support from more\n            focused interventions. Addressing these kinds of objectives\n            in sectors ranging from education and health to electricity\n            and agriculture was outside the competency of ARRA -\n            Azerbaijan Agency for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of\n            Areas - which had been established to implement the narrower\n            reconstruction program. Further lessons suggest that\n            operations involving multiple donors must be carefully\n            designed to allow for different agendas, financing\n            arrangements, and funding timetables among donors; yet, also\n            suggest that too narrowly limiting project beneficiaries may\n            create additional social and political risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -
