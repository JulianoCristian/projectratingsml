In a country that shows\n            overall limited project implementation effectiveness, it is\n            also important to define a realistic time line for project\n            implementation and/or scope of activities. Full development\n            impact from liberalization of the sector, including\n            privatization of the incumbent, can only be experienced when\n            liberalization actions are comprehensive and timely. Three\n            key factors are needed for a rural access component to be\n            successful: a good strategy based on an accurate evaluation\n            of the market components (supply and demand), the existence\n            of the right balance of competition in the market and\n            incentives mechanisms embedded in the tender process, and a\n            swift implementation of

Project components will: 1)\n            develop a telecommunication policy, through consulting\n            services to reflect the principles of liberalization,\n            independent regulation, and privatization of the Public\n            Telecommunication Company (TDM). Assistance will also be\n            provided to the Ministry of Transport and Communications in\n            building capacity in sector analysis, policy formulation,\n            and monitoring criteria to liaise throughout the reform\n            process. Additionally, a comprehensive telecommunications,\n            and postal legal, and regulatory framework will be prepared,\n            by strengthening the Telecommunications and Postal\n            Regulatory Authority's capacity, and, technical\n            assistance (TA) will support TDM's privatization. A\n            strategy for market-based rural access should establish\n            provision of seed money, and universal fund access, while a\n            modernization strategy will elaborate a

Reform Project aims\n            to assist the government to a) identify the extent of the\n            existing environmental liabilities of public enterprises and\n            rank them accordingly as to which needs full audit or no\n            audit; b) broadly assess the environmental conditions at the\n            enterprises to be privatized against the risk of being held\n            responsible for damages after privatization; c) use the\n            environmental pre-audit as a starting point for assessing\n            the enterprise's environmental and health status prior\n            to privatization; and d) assess the responsibility of\n            monitoring and compliance of each party to meet the\n            internationally accepted environmental standards. The\n            pre-audit will be conducted in two phases: focusing to\n            privatize the telecommunication company -- Telecommunicacoes\n            de Mozambique (TDM), the national airline -- Linheas Aeras\n            de Mozambique (LAM) , and to concession the Maputo\n            International Airport (MIA). For MIA, a partial pre-audit\n            will be required to deal with solid waste disposal,\n            treatment of water, and VOA equipment. For LAM, no audit is\n            required since the current fleet being operated does not\n            pose any environmental concerns, For TDM, no audit is\n            required since TDM has been able to resolve the main\n            concerns relating to the decommissioning of cross-bar\n            exchanges and other analog equipment with a Zimbabwean enterprise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Communication Sector Reform :\n            environmental impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Communication Sector\n
