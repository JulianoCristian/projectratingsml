Some\n            lessons learned includes: it is critical that the outcomes\n            and the targets are defined to be consistent with the\n            Project's broader objective. An interconnection project\n            creates the capacity to generate exports and revenues, as\n            well as lay the groundwork for future interconnection\n            opportunities. The indicator targets should also take into\n            account not only the interconnection's technical\n            capacity but also the political economy risks and\n            contractual delays. Contractual frameworks should be\n            established early on, ideally by the time of project\n            appraisal. While contractual issues are still feasible as\n            occurred in this project, the risk of contractual delays\n            could be mitigated with agreements in place at the time of\n            appraisal. Transmission projects are inherently complex,\n            with implementation impacted by technical, safeguards, and\n            construction issues. Such risks are compounded in\n            interconnection projects with political economy risks such\n            as in sub-regional projects. It is imperative that the\n            expertise and oversight planned for the supervision of\n            projects is sustained throughout implementation. Lapses in\n            enforcement of the occupational safety and health aspects of\n            social safeguards can lead to serious accidents and even\n            deaths. The Bank's engagement is important with all\n            parties to an interconnection project to enable due\n            diligence, supervision, and monitoring of the commensurate\n            investments in the countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Ethiopia/Nile Basin Initiative\n            Power Export Project : Ethiopia-Sudan

of\n            the power systems in the Eastern Nile region by promoting\n            regional power trade through the establishment of\n            coordinated planning and the erection of transmission\n            interconnections in the context of multi-purpose water and\n            energy resources development in the region. The closing date\n            for the project will be extended by one year from June 30,\n            2012 until June 30, 2013. This project was approved on\n            December 20, 2007 with a closing date of December 31, 2011.\n            At the request of the Government of Ethiopia, the original\n            closing date was previously extended to the current closing\n            date of June 30, 2012. With this second extension of the\n            closing date the credit will be extended cumulatively for\n            eighteen months. The transmission line construction planned\n            under the project has been completed and the transmission\n            line has been commissioned. Three substations planned under\n            the project are almost complete. The project performance is\n            currently rated as moderately satisfactory given the delays\n            in construction. The project development objectives continue\n            to be achievable. The extension is necessary to allow\n            sufficient time to the implementing agency to complete\n            project construction activities. The substation contractor\n            has not been able to transfer funds to the equipment\n            manufacturers due to reasons beyond its control and is\n            considered as force majeure. Recently, the implementing\n            agency Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) and the\n            contractor reached agreement to amend the existing contract\n            arrangements such that EEPCo could sign direct contracts\n            with the manufacturers, and thus ensure payment and supply\n            of the equipment to the project site. Due to this contract\n            amendment and the ensuing delay in completing construction,\n            the implementing agency requires additional time to complete\n            the project construction works. Based on the revised\n            implementation plan submitted by EEPCO, the project works\n            are expected to be complete by June 30, 2013. There is no\n            audit report outstanding for this project and the last audit\n            was found satisfactory based on an action plan to remove\n            audit

restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the\n            Ethiopia/Nile Basin Initiative: Ethiopia-Sudan\n            Interconnector Project is to improve the effectiveness of\n            the power systems in the Eastern Nile region by promoting\n            regional power trade through the establishment of\n            coordinated planning and the erection of transmission\n            interconnections in the context of multi-purpose water and\n            energy resources development in the region. The closing date\n            for the project will be extended by one year from June 30,\n            2012 until June 30, 2013. This project was approved on\n            December 20, 2007 with a closing date of December 31, 2011.\n            At the request of the Government of Ethiopia, the original\n            closing date was previously extended to the current closing\n            date of June 30, 2012. With this second extension of the\n            closing date the credit will be extended cumulatively for\n            eighteen months. The transmission line construction planned\n            under the project has been completed and the transmission\n            line has been commissioned. Three substations planned under\n            the project are almost complete. The project performance is\n            currently rated as moderately satisfactory given the delays\n            in construction. The project development objectives continue\n            to be achievable. The extension is necessary to allow\n            sufficient time to the implementing agency to complete\n            project construction activities. The substation contractor\n            has not been able to transfer funds to the equipment\n            manufacturers due to reasons beyond its control and is\n            considered as force majeure. Recently, the implementing\n            agency Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) and the\n            contractor reached agreement to amend the existing contract\n            arrangements such that EEPCo could sign direct contracts\n            with the manufacturers, and thus ensure payment and supply\n            of the equipment to the project site. Due to this contract\n            amendment and the ensuing delay in completing construction,\n            the implementing agency requires additional time to complete\n            the project construction works. Based on the revised\n            implementation plan submitted by EEPCO, the project works\n            are expected to be complete by June 30, 2013. There is no\n            audit report outstanding for this project and the last audit\n            was found satisfactory based on an action plan to remove\n            audit qualifications."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Ethiopia/Nile Basin\n            Initiative: Ethiopia-Sudan Interconnector Project :\n            restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16380082/ethiopia-ethiopianile-basin-initiative-ethiopia-sudan-interconnector-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"ET-Ethiopia/Nile Basin Initiative:\n            Ethiopia-Sudan Interconnector -- P074011","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Contract Law,Housing & Human Habitats,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120615014144"},"theme":"Export development and competitiveness,Regional integration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Power","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, BASIN, construction,\n            contractor, direct contracts, equipment, existing contract,\n            force majeure, implementation plan, implementing agency, transmission"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Trade and integration","repnb":"69773"},"24495917":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/05/24495917/ethiopia-promoting-economic-growth-\u00e9thiopie-prot\u00e9ger-les-plus-vuln\u00e9rables","available_in":"Spanish,English,French","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"Spanish","entityid":"090224b082e95424_1_0","node_id":"24495917"},{"lang":"English","entityid":"000470435_20150205113135","node_id":"24495917"}],"virt_coll":"Results Profile","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/05/24495917/ethiopia-promoting-economic-growth-\u00e9thiopie-prot\u00e9ger-les-plus-vuln\u00e9rables","new_url":"2015/05/24495917/ethiopia-promoting-economic-growth-\u00e9thiopie-prot\u00e9ger-les-plus-vuln\u00e9rables","disclosure_date":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b082e9541f","chronical_docm_id":"090224b082e9541f","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/05/18/090224b082e9541f/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/0thiopie000Fiche0de0r0sultats.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/05/18/090224b082e9541f/1_0/Rendered/PDF/0thiopie000Fiche0de0r0sultats.pdf","loan_no":"50910;43750;H2790;45610;45780;47130","docdt":"2012-05-29T06:04:03Z","datestored":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Promoting economic growth"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The International Development\n            Association (IDA) is Ethiopia's largest provider of\n            official development assistance: it has committed over US$7\n            billion to more than 60 projects in Ethiopia since 1991,\n            most notably for the protection of basic services,\n            productive safety nets, energy and roads projects.

Since\n            June 2011, the implementing agency couldn't transfer\n            funds to the substation contractor due to reasons beyond\n            project control. The closing date of the project will be\n            extended from December 31, 2011 until June 30, 2012. This\n            will be the first extension of the project which is\n            extending the closing date by about six months from the\n            original closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main
