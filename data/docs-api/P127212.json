The proposed extension is necessary to make\n            up for the nearly 6-month lag between project approval and\n            effectiveness. The program encompasses the financing of\n            sub-projects focusing on meeting social needs by improving\n            service delivery at the local level. The project contributes\n            to: (i) fostering social cohesion and stabilization among\n            disadvantaged populations following the January 2011\n            revolution; and (ii) mitigating the socioeconomic risks\n            faced by Tunisian returnees fleeing Libyan civil strife and\n            by Tunisian communities near the border with Libya affected\n            by depressed cross-border trade and commerce.
