The\n            overall rating for all the four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            rating, and also the performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower for all four projects is rated as satisfactory. The\n            main lessons learned from this review are: (i) as noted in\n            Independent Evaluation Group (IEG's) ICR Review of\n            Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL III), project\n            design needs to be clearly aligned with its development\n            objectives in order to attain the latter. Even if the\n            structural deficit of the central administration is\n            \"highly sensitive and political\" as the ICR\n            states, the magnitudes of these structural rigidities were\n            such that they must be addressed if progress is to be made\n            in achieving the substantial fiscal adjustment that is\n            required for sustained macroeconomic stability; (ii) loans\n            with large numbers of objectives and conditions, and\n            involving too many institutions relative to the management\n            capacity of the Government and the Bank itself, overtax the\n            implementation capacity of both the Bank and the borrower\n            and result in poor execution; (iii) the inclusion of\n            objectives of widely different levels of priority and weak\n            connection with the ultimate goals of the operations tends\n            to obscure the degree of attainment of the latter; and (iv)\n            success depends on the borrower's ownership of the\n            objectives of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal Adjustment; and\n            First, Second,

- Second Programmatic Fiscal and\n            Institutional Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Colombia Second Programmatic Fiscal\n            and Institutional Structural Adjustment Loan Project had a\n            satisfactory outcome, likely sustainability, substantial\n            institutional development impact, overall satisfactory Bank\n            and Borrower performances. The following lessonswere cited:\n            1)  A high number of project components increases particular\n            risks. This project had a total of 11 components in 4 broad\n            groupings where the sheer breadth of topics, each with a\n            specific reform plan, made the program particularly risky.\n            The risks arise from the failure of a single component,\n            which places the entire program at risk, since the\n            assumption is that the program is a coherent\n            \"whole\" that will lose integrity if parts are\n            removed; high transaction costs due to the need to deal with\n            multiple implementing agencies, retain multi-sector\n            competency in the supervising team, and achieve enough\n            analytical depth in each of the sectors; and losing a grasp\n            of the overall program's coherence. This project was\n            considered to be a fiscal adjustment operation and therefore\n            subject to different standards. 2) Keep the number of policy\n            actions reasonable. High numbers of policy actions increase\n            the risk, add to transaction costs, and often do not add\n            substance. Focus on results. That was done in the tax\n            administration component, where the initial focus on a large\n            set of specific actions (developing taxpayer registries,\n            carrying out audits, improving information quality, and\n            more) was substituted later on by two results indicators\n            (evasion and efficiency). 3) Where the assessment indicates\n            a relatively low probability of passing laws, the scope of\n            the reform program should be narrowed to include only those\n            elements under the Executive Branch's control. 4) Add a\n            coherent and comprehensive package of technical assistance.\n            5) Monitoring and evaluation arrangements must be ready\n            up-front. 6) Task management from the field adds significant\n            value; close and constant interaction with the client\n            improves the probability of a successful outcome."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second Programmatic

Third Programmatic Fiscal and\n            Institutional Structural Adjustment Loan Project within the\n            program will focus primarily on the following key policy\n            actions: a) acceleration of the phase-out of tax exemptions\n            for profits of certain firms; b) increased revenues derived\n            from improvements in tax administration of at least 0.3\n            percent of GDP, between 2003 and 2004, while maintaining\n            DIAN - Direccion de Impuestos y Aduanas Nacionales -\n            administrative costs per peso collected, below 0.96 percent;\n            c) submission of a new budget law to improve the overall\n            budgeting framework, complementing the 2003 Fiscal\n            Responsibility Law; d) further improvements in the royalty\n            transfer system, including restructuring of the National\n            Royalty Fund; e) implementation of the legal defense of the\n            State policy; f) establishment of oversight bodies for both\n            procurement and asset management; g) compliance with the\n            pilot management contracts with ICBF - Institution\n            Colombiano de Binestar Familiar - and SENA - Servicio\n            Nacional de Aprendizaje; and, h) further progress in the\n            monitoring system for the public sector reform process.\n            Nonetheless, risks exist, namely: the uncertain political\n            environment in the midst of a campaign for a presidential\n            re-election; difficulty in controlling aggregate expenditure\n            levels because of failure of key measures to contain them;\n            institutional gaps that may remain after the public\n            downsizing exercise, thus jeopardizing key roles, and\n
