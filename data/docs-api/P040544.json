Some lessons\n            learned included: (1) given the large attitudinal shift\n            involved in the agricultural transition, government\n            officials and project staff need substantial technical\n            assistance and training before operations can be expected to\n            succeed; (2) in the complex and rapidly changing ECA\n            environment, sound donor coordination was critical; (3) with\n            respect to agriculture and agribusiness services, project\n            experience demonstrated that farmers and rural business\n            owners will respond enthusiastically to innovative\n            technologies corresponding to their needs; (4) on land\n            administration, the Bank\u0092s international experience\n            strengthened the design of projects in ECA, and these\n            projects showed the importance of avoiding a\n            'one-size-fits- all' approach and the sound payoff\n            to adopting a unified approach to develop property registry\n            and cadaster; and (5) the rural finance operations showed\n            that with appropriate regulation, technical advice and staff\n            training banks that lend to rural areas can operate\n            sustainably; also, non-bank financial intermediaries have an\n            important role to play in rural areas; but it is

Ratings for the Agricultural\n            Development and Credit Project for Azerbaijan are as\n            follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; Bank performance was satisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the projects included: Azerbaijan's\n            largely successful land reform program has been\n            characterized by full and individualized (ownership by\n            families) privatization of land, a package approach\n            combining agricultural services with land reform, and a\n            rapid and single-step change rather than gradual or phased\n            implementation. While the great diversity of experience\n            across countries indicates that there is no uniquely right\n            land reform model, Azerbaijan's approach is an option\n            for other countries to consider. The reform process is\n            critical for determining whether land reform works. In\n            Azerbaijan's case, client focus, transparency, and\n            stakeholder involvement were central to reform\n            implementation, and a learning oriented and innovative\n            culture was fostered. Privatize service delivery reduce\n            requirements for extra government staff. Land reform needs\n            powerful champions to succeed. Exceptional commitment by\n            champions in the Government and the Bank were critical to\n            the success under the projects evaluated here."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Farm

These were some of the lessons learned:\n            1) With Government support and advice about where the\n            opportunities are for feasible reform, a Bank project can\n            support profound change. Even with strong preparation and\n            good design, this project required the active and energetic\n            intervention of ministers, whose commitment was strengthened\n            by the fact that they were overseeing the success of their\n            own initiative. 2) Perceived fairness of distribution\n            provides strong support for the sustainability of a land\n            distribution program. The methodology used to distribute\n            farmland allocated parcels by lottery. This approach assured\n            that those who designed the parcel division would seek\n            evenness in value, not knowing which parcel they themselves\n            might receive. 3) A key to success of rural credit\n            initiatives is whether the project team correctly identifies\n            the issues faced by farmers. An over-lengthy credit\n            application, the need to travel to the capital for an\n            application, inconveniently timed repayments, the likelihood\n            that market profits will be robbed on the road - all these\n            and a host of other micro-issues affect success. Unraveling\n            of these by listening to the client and analyzing rural\n            incentives can take a rural credit initiative from apparent\n            failure to success. 4) Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            are not necessarily well-prepared to focus on participatory\n            work and listen to the voices of the poor. The NGO hired for\n            community development was not specifically instructed to\n            achieve economic gain for the poorest members of the\n            community. In short, the NGO behaved as a rational economic\n            actor meeting its terms of reference (TORs) and achieving\n            payment and a growth in salable experience. Perhaps no more\n            should have been expected, and the TOR should have been\n            written accordingly. 5) The transaction costs of rural\n            credit are high. These costs are sometimes concealed by the\n            structure of donor or government-sponsored initiatives.\n            However, they must not be underestimated if work toward\n            sustainable rural credit is undertaken."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Farm Privatization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Azerbaijan - Farm Privatization
