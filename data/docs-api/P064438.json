The AENP lies\n            to the north of the city of Port Elizabeth, in South\n            Africa\u2019s Eastern Cape Province. The park is one of the most\n            diverse conservation areas in Southern Africa which contain\n            rich marine ecosystems. AENP was one of South Africa\u2019s most\n            economically challenged provinces, faced with high rates of\n            illiteracy and unemployment. Persistent poverty, unabated\n            over the years by subsistence livestock farming, posed a\n            threat to the region\u2019s biodiversity and hastened\n            desertification as communities struggled to eke out a living\n            from their surrounding natural resource base. The\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n            provided a grant from the Global Environment Facility as\n            well as the expertise and technical knowledge of several\n            experts. As a result, income from tourism became significant\n            economic benefit to the region. Populations of one of the\n            most threatened species in the AENP and in all of Africa,\n            the black rhinoceros population, continues to increase\n            within the park. Employment amongst local businesses showed\n            steady increase resulting in the creation of new jobs by new\n            private sector enterprises The project has contributed to a\n            revitalization of the local environment and economy by\n            providing an opportunity for local communities to benefit\n            financially from the removal of invasive alien vegetation,\n            and serves as a benchmark for further future community\n            development projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"A successful conservation and socio-economic\n            model in Addo elephant national park in South Africa"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"A successful conservation and\n            socio-economic model in Addo elephant national park in South Africa"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/25202108/successful-conservation-socio-economic-model-addo-elephant-national-park-south-africa","count":"South Africa","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"dogs, livestock farming, ecosystem, national\n            parks, conservation areas, vegetation, predator, park\n            planning, park management plan, nature, tourists,\n            conservation vision, parks, park wildlife, number of\n            tourists, protection, conservation planning, forests,\n            programs, conservation programs, environmental\n            rehabilitation, monitoring, approach to biodiversity,\n            visitors, sustainable agriculture, biomes, tourism, marine\n            ecosystems, tourist, wild dogs, bay, food, invasive alien\n            species, grasslands, unique biodiversity, crane, rhinos,\n            alien species, spur, roads, biological diversity, natural\n            resource base, humpback, tourism development, national park\n            project, dolphins, elephant, wildlife, lodge construction,\n            ecosystems, landscape, marine biodiversity, black rhinos,\n            coastal plains, local communities, statistics, natural\n            resource, vegetation species, park management, elephants,\n            private land, nature conservation, mountains, conservation,\n            invasive species, tourism enterprises, plains, water,\n            conservation policies, biodiversity, species, humpback\n            dolphins, ecosystem degradation, community, conservation\n            partners, farming, livestock, bird, national park, water\n            conservation, threatened species, biodiversity conservation,\n            native species"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Financial and private sector development","projn":"ZA-The Greater Addo Elephant National Park\n            Project -- P064438","topic":"Tourism Investment Climate m1326299 825,Tourism Value Chain m1326508 1230,Culture Heritage and Sustainable Tourism\n            m1327654 1765,Ecotourism m1327362 589,Natural Resource Management  m1326446 1979,Natural Habitats m1327129 1787","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Tourism and Ecotourism,Water Conservation,Wildlife Resources,Ecosystems and Natural Habitats","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Environment,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08316c994_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Biodiversity,Rural non-farm income generation","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Resources","prdln":"Global Environment Project","topicv3":"Tourism Investment Climate m1326299 825,Tourism Value Chain m1326508 1230,Culture Heritage and Sustainable Tourism\n            m1327654 1765,Ecotourism m1327362 589,Natural Resource Management  m1326446 1979,Natural Habitats m1327129 1787","owner":"Envir & Nat.

Some lessons learned included: Implementing a\n            participatory approach to achieve biodiversity conservation\n            with government programs, private sector and local\n            communities can be effective both for improving biodiversity\n            conservation and for promoting economic development.\n            Expanding the original area of a national park to include\n            new ecosystems can be an important approach to climate\n            change mitigation and adaptation. Literature discusses the\n            benefits of incorporating continuous ecosystems to\n            mitigation and support adaptation due to climate change.\n            Income generated through nature based tourism can compete\n            successfully with that generated through agricultural\n            activities, especially considering that agriculture income\n            is limited by the poor soil conditions and water\n            availability. This project demonstrated this in a concrete\n            way, both, through investments and through a detailed\n            socio-economic survey. Community development and managed\n            areas is an important strategy for conservation. The\n            Mayibuye Ndlovu Development Trust (MNDT) is an excellent\n            model for organizing communities around a protected area and\n            for assisting them in establishing a legally registered\n            entity and developing economic activities. The importance of\n            sound science remains essential to conservation planning and\n            in answering inquiries from difficult stakeholders.\n            Gathering reliable scientific information should remain a\n            cornerstone of such projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Africa - Greater Addo Elephant\n            National Park Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"South Africa - Greater Addo\n            Elephant National Park Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/04/14695155/south-africa-greater-addo-elephant-national-park-project","projn":"ZA-The Greater Addo Elephant National Park\n            Project -- P064438","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Wetlands,Forestry,Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Water Resources,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"South Africa","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20110801004307"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,General education sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Resources,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Rural Development","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural land,Agricultural\n            lands,agricultural sector,Agriculture,air,air\n            pollution,Biodiversity,biodiversity conservation,capacity\n            building,commercial fishing,community\n            development,Conservation,Cost\n            Analysis,Desertification,ecological\n            integrity,ecology,economic conditions,economic\n            development,economic growth,economic\n            value,Ecosystem,ecosystem degradation,ecosystem\n            health,ecosystem management,Ecosystems,employment,Endangered\n            Species,environmental degradation,Environmental\n            Management,Environmental policies,Environmental\n            problems,environmental\n            sustainability,farmers,Farming,farms,financial\n            resources,Fish,fishing,fishing industry,forestry,forestry\n            sector,Freshwater,GIS,habitat\n            requirements,habitats,hunting,income,intervention,labor\n            force,land acquisition,land degradation,land owners,land\n            tenure,land users,land\n            uses,land-use,legislation,livestock,managers,marginal\n            lands,Memorandum of Understanding,MOU,natural\n            capital,natural resource,natural resource base,natural\n            resource development,natural resource management,natural\n            resources,natural resources management,offshore\n            islands,Parks,Partnership,plant diversity,population\n            growth,poverty line,poverty reduction,private\n            sector,productivity,public education,public\n            participation,rainfall,relative value,research\n            projects,resources management,Rural Development,social\n            policy,social services,soils,Sustainable\n            Development,sustainable use,UNDP,United\n            Nations,wages,waste,waste\n            management,Wildlife,workersNational parks;

The project also aims to\n            contribute to poverty reduction by creating direct\n            employment in nature conservation and by catalyzing the\n            development of eco-tourism. The project has the following\n            five components. Component 1) will build on the conservation\n            planning exercise largely undertaken during the preparation\n            phase of the project and forms the biological basis for the\n            implementation phase. The preparatory studies focused on the\n            systematic conservation planning exercise, freshwater\n            conservation, proposed marine protected area (MPA), and\n            ecological monitoring of the marine environment. The five\n            sub-components each largely deal with park planning and will\n            form part of the overall Integrated Environmental Management\n            System (IEMS). Component 2) Implementation will occur in\n            three different management scenarios: (1) SANParks land\n            owned and managed by SANParks, (2) concessioned areas within\n            SANParks land, and (3) contractual land adjoining the Park\n            where SANParks may or may not manage the land. The three\n            sub-components will roll out of the development plan,\n            inclusive of ecological management, infrastructure\n            development and land incorporation, to ensure effective\n            implementation of the development plan. Component 3)\n            includes the design, implementation and maintenance of\n            management systems and structures to enhance Park management\n            and strengthening/creating institutional structures for\n            effective, participatory Park planning and program\n            implementation. Component 4) will support implementation of\n            the Park development plan where it relates to employment and\n            economic benefits through communal conservation strategies,\n            Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME) opportunities,\n            environmental education and fair resettlement of displaced\n            individuals. This component will forge the benefits of\n            sustainable natural resource use with social upliftment,\n            particularly of previously disadvantaged sectors of society."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Africa - Greater Addo Elephant\n            National Park Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"South Africa - Greater Addo\n            Elephant National

will establish a\n            mega-biodiversity conservation area in, and around the\n            existing Addo Elephant National Park, an area of global\n            biodiversity value, which contains five, out of seven plant\n            biomes found within South Africa, in addition to the\n            proposed adjoining marine environment, which is also of\n            considerable biodiversity value. The project will therefore\n            support the expansion of the Park, and marine protected\n            areas, significantly boosting eco-tourism. To this end, land\n            acquisition is already taking place, therefore, this\n            resettlement action plan sets the policy framework in\n            compliance with the Bank operational policy, and the\n            country's legal framework guiding the principles for\n            compensation, income restoration, and implementation and\n            monitoring arrangements. A Resettlement Working Group has\n            been set up to include maximum participation by the affected\n            people in the resettlement process, to identify displaced\n            populations from appropriated farms. Alternative\n            accommodation, and facilities will be provided for loss of\n            access to farms, also allowing, the possibility to work for\n            the Poverty Relief program, while SANParks negotiates with\n            the Department of Housing, the necessary funds per household\n            to build new housing in the town of the affected\n            people's choice. Appropriate jobs have been identified\n            for displaced persons, and, training will be provided to\n            ensure satisfactory performances in their new jobs, as part\n            of the identified capacity building program. An\n            investigation of the viability of alternative income\n            generating strategies is ongoing, particularly through\n            negotiations with the Department of Land Affairs in terms of\n            the Land Reform Grants, which would afford a specified grant\n            for each household, through which profitable agricultural\n            activities may result."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Africa -

Within the country's\n            environmental legal framework, and Bank environmental\n            policies, the EA looks at the natural environment, i.e.,\n            biodiversity, freshwater, and marine environments, and, at\n            the socioeconomic environment on the Eastern Cape, the\n            largest of South Africa's nine provinces, and third\n            largest in population. While the project offers a more\n            sustainable, and economically viable form of land use for\n            most of the planning domain than the current agricultural\n            option, providing long-term security to the mix of\n            biodiversity, and ecological processes, yet, a legitimate\n            concern on the regional economy - i.e., the agricultural\n            sector, particularly the dairy industry - and social aspects\n            regarding the labor market, namely farm workers, foster the\n            following mitigation measures. International, and national\n            conservation standards should be met, in order to enhance\n            eco-tourism as an economic tool that generates employment\n            opportunities within the SANParks, Eastern Cape, and South\n            Africa at large (Eco-tourism has limited costs to the\n            environment, compared with intensive farming). It is\n            highlighted that red data species should be preserved, and\n            research opportunities enhanced, towards the protection of\n            unknown medicinal plants. Within the ecological services to\n            be provided, opportunities for social, and financial uplift\n            of local communities will develop. To this end, a\n            restructuring of the Addo Planning Forum is recommended to\n            include a wider representation, and diversification of\n            duties. A communication strategy has been designed to form\n            the link with stakeholders, and enable communities'\n            concerns to be taken into consideration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Africa -
