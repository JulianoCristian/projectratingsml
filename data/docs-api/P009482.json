This project has been\n            unsuccessful, it provides a number of opportunities to\n            consider what lessons can be learned. Policy and\n            institutional changes should be demonstrated in advance of\n            making large investments. Intense supervision should be\n            directed mainly at institutional development objectives.\n            Consideration of using other instruments, such as\n            introducing key requirements into a Sector Adjustment Loan,\n            could have helped obtain the type of major policy change\n            required. It is essential that supervision, by the borrower\n            and lender, ensures that the agreements are strictly\n            honored. Comments by Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage\n            Authority stress the importance of high-level monitoring of\n            progress by its own Ministry, to highlight areas where\n
