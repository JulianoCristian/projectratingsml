Some lessons learned included: Pension\n            reform is a complex technical and political process which\n            needs a strong local ownership as well as appropriate\n            respect of outsiders to the country's political\n            sensitivities. Over the last decade of World Bank\n            involvement in Brazil's pension policy dialogue the\n            Government requested technical support but asked the Bank to\n            maintain a discrete public role. The Bank has done this\n            during the preparation of this loan and the elaboration of\n            the Economic and Sector Work (ESW) prepared on the\n            Government's request.Follow-up pension reforms may not\n            take place within the expected timeframe due to political\n            resistance. The second reform in the program is still under\n            discussion in the Government but may not take place during\n            this administration. The Bank must be prepared to accept\n            this reality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Programmatic Fiscal Reform Loan -\n            Social Security Reform
