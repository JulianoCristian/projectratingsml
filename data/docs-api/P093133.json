Some lessons learned included: The\n            government's strong ownership of the program was\n            critical for a successful outcome. The satisfactory outcome\n            of the DPL I and the completion of the DPL II actions were\n            to a large extent a consequence of the government commitment\n            to achieve the medium-term targets and to present to the\n            National Assembly the legal reforms necessary for its\n            successful implementation. The latter were achieved through\n            a consensus-building process with the Opposition at the\n            beginning of the new administration. As this Implementation,\n            Completion and Results Report (ICR) review has demonstrated,\n            the government has made substantial progress toward\n            achieving the medium-term objectives established for the\n            programmatic series of four DPL despite the fact that only\n            one of them was approved and executed. The Bank should\n            examine the possibility, when the risk of a political\n            gridlock is high, to approve the total amount of the DPL\n            series which will be activated and disbursed gradually once\n            compliance of the relevant medium term triggers occur. This\n            policy will facilitate negotiations between the Executive\n            and Legislative branches of Government, when the opposition\n            has control over the latter, avoiding lengthy and costly\n            negotiations every year."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - First Broad-Based Growth\n            Development Policy Loan

series of four DPLs intended to support the\n            government's medium-term development strategy and rated\n            as highly satisfactory. This operation was correctly focused\n            on the initial building blocks: (a) fiscal measures to meet\n            the challenges of stemming growth of debt and preserving\n            space for key growth-related and social investments; and (b)\n            growth, with special emphasis on measures related to\n            widening trade opportunities as well as continuing public\n            sector modernization efforts. The subsequent DPLs are\n            intended to support the broader development agenda of\n            private sector development, institutional\n            development/capacity building, and infrastructure\n            development. This DPL and the three planned additional\n            operations are intended to contribute to the\n            government's objectives of re-igniting growth,\n            particularly through increased trade and investment,\n            reinforcing macroeconomic stability and strengthening fiscal\n            sustainability, and increasing the efficiency and\n            transparency of public sector management. This operation\n            will help El Salvador meet its fiscal needs, supporting the\n            government's goals of fiscal stabilization and\n            efficiency in spending, endorse sound policies, become the\n            vehicle for securing overall continuity of the Bank's\n            policy dialogue with El Salvador, and strengthen the\n            Bank's reputation as a reliable

Policy Loan\n            for El Salvador is part of a Programmatic series of four\n            development policy loans intended to support the\n            Government's medium term development strategy to\n            accelerate broad based and equitable economic growth and to\n            contribute to the Government's objectives of (1)\n            reigniting growth, particularly through increased private\n            investment and trade; (2) reinforcing macroeconomic\n            stability and strengthening fiscal sustainability; and (3)\n            increasing the efficiency and transparency of public sector\n            management. The first area includes policies to expand trade\n            opportunities and improve the investment climate. The second\n            area highlights measures related to expanding tax revenues,\n            reducing the fiscal burden of pension reform and\n            strengthening the financial sector. The third area supports\n            public sector modernization efforts, with emphasis on the\n            areas of procurement, e-government and public financial management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El
