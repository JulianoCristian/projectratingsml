There are six main lessons learned\n            from the project: (a) the lack of an adequate policy and\n            regulatory framework made the transition away from ODS into\n            substitutes more difficult and prolonged; (b) the lack of\n            public awareness of the ODS phase-out objective during early\n            project years also made the transition away from ODS into\n            substitutes more difficult; (c) the project will have\n            benefited from increased involvement of provincial and local\n            governments; (d) the way in which project beneficiaries and\n            enterprises were selected was too mechanical; (e) the\n            process of technology transfer is not completely under the\n            control of the project and therefore introduces\n            uncertainties; and (f) the quality and continuity of key\n            personnel benefited the project immensely."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Third Ozone Depleting
