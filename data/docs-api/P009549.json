Experience with this project confirms\n            a number of lessons: 1) Continuous attention should be paid\n            to implementation performance in disaster-related\n            operations, to ensure that such operations do not sideline\n            needed sector reforms. Issues that particularly require\n            attention are ensuring that the Borrower has the\n            institutional capacity to manage, and monitor social\n            mobilization and resettlement, and is conversant with the\n            Bank's procurement procedures (in this operation, the\n            Borrower's attention to social mobilization and\n            resettlement languished, once donor financing ceased). 2)\n            Technical and social/organizational assistance, essential\n            for the introduction of new innovations in doing business,\n            must be fully funded for the duration of a project. This\n            project also highlighted the importance of harmonization of\n            policies among donors, for sub-sectors in which they share\n            common concerns and investment. If development partners are\n            unwilling to commit to the duration of the project, then\n            alternative ways of financing technical assistance should be\n            explored. 3) Coastal defenses should be renovated to higher\n            engineering standards within homogenous units. This not only\n            has greater sustainability than isolated repairs of existing\n            infrastructure, but it also provides a model that can be\n            monitored to test the success of the innovation - an\n            important design consideration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Coastal Embankment\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Coastal Embankment\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5757701/bangladesh-coastal-embankment-rehabilitation-project","projn":"BD-Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation -- P009549","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Engineering,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Science and Technology Development,Transport,Rural Development","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050425100738"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Flood protection","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Science and Technology Development,Transport,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB, afforestation, agricultural extension,\n            agricultural output, agricultural production, agriculture,\n            Asian Development Bank, bidding, Bridge, capacity building,\n            civil society, Climate Change, communities, community\n            participation, compaction, conditionality, construction,\n            contract awards, crop varieties, cropping, crops, culverts,\n            developed countries, drainage, EMBANKMENT, embankments,\n            environmental impacts, equipment, erosion, European\n            Commission, exchange rate, farmers, fish, Fisheries,\n            flooding, Forestry, forests, fuel, global warming, highways,\n            housing, human development, HYV, income, incomes,\n            innovation, institutional capacity, Irrigation, land\n            acquisition, land use, Livelihoods, livestock, mangrove,\n            natural resources, net benefits, NGOs, population growth,\n            Poverty Reduction, private sector, procurement, procurement\n            procedures, productivity, rice, roads, rural development,\n            rural infrastructure, rural poverty, sanitation, savings,\n            social development, structures, Sustainable Development,\n            sustainable use, timber, transparency, transport,\n            vegetables, vehicles, Water Resources, wetlands, wood"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021275-COASTAL EMBANKMENT\n            REHABILITATION PROJ","repnb":"31565"},"2403324":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/06/2403324/bangladesh-coastal-embankment-rehabilitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/06/2403324/bangladesh-coastal-embankment-rehabilitation-project","new_url":"2003/06/2403324/bangladesh-coastal-embankment-rehabilitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/06/30/000012009_20030630111203/Rendered/INDEX/26149.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/06/30/000012009_20030630111203/Rendered/PDF/26149.pdf","credit_no":"2783","docdt":"2003-06-23T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2003-06-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Coastal Embankment\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The assessment of outcome is\n            satisfactory, sustainability likely, though institutional\n            development impacts were only modest, with both performances\n            by the Bank, and Borrower rated satisfactory. Lessons drawn\n            form the project convey the following. 1) Embankment design\n            must combine engineering solutions with appropriate\n            plantation: the components supported by the project,\n            including vegetative practices on the embankment slopes, and\n            afforestation to reduce cyclone damage, and embankment\n            maintenance costs, are good in physical, financial and\n            social terms. The technically sound project interventions\n            combined sustainable embankment maintenance practices, with\n            gains in agricultural production, and farm incomes, setting\n            the foundation of the project's success. 2)  Need for a\n            comprehensive approach in coastal zone management. future\n            projects should assist the Government to prepare and\n            implement a comprehensive development plan in line with\n            their policy, to include: (a) coastal protection plan; (b) a\n            network of safe havens; and, (c) a disaster preparedness,\n            and response system. The Integrated Coastal Zone Management\n            (ICZM) concept will be essential for ensuring sustainable\n            development of the coastal zone, and, to this end, adequate\n            attention and funding has to be provided to monitor the\n            physical conditions of coastal embankments, and\n            environmental and social impacts in the coastal areas. 3)\n            Harmonization of donor policies and procedures: The\n            difficulties, experienced in co-financing of technical\n            assistance (TA), reflect lack of implementation readiness,\n            and the need for harmonizing donor policies, and procedures\n            for timely flow of funds. 4) Procurement reform is essential\n            to improve public sector accountability: improper\n            procurement practices found under the project, reinforce the\n            importance of public sector procurement reform, fortunately,\n            a public procurement reform project is now underway, to\n            strictly follow the new procurement rules and standard\n            bidding practices; including a reform approach toward\n            procurement of maintenance works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Coastal Embankment\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Coastal Embankment\n

Report (ICR) for the Priority Works Program (PWP) of the\n            Coastal Embankment Rehabilitation Project (CERP) in\n            Bangladesh. Following the May 1985 cyclone, the Government\n            of Bangladesh (GOB) formulated in 1986 a National Cyclone\n            Protection Program (NCPP) with the objectives of minimizing\n            disastrous effects of cyclones and storm surges. NCPP\n            included plans for improving the coastal embankment system\n            and introducing associated preventive measures. The\n            objectives of PWP were to: (i) protect the agricultural\n            areas within the polders against inundation by saline water;\n            and (ii) provide protection against loss of human lives and\n            damages caused by cyclonic storm surges. It should be noted\n            that the Bank was prompt in responding to the request for\n            emergency assistance from the Borrower, the quality of the\n            physical works is good and the objectives of this assistance\n            in terms of protection of human life and property and\n            increased agricultural production are expected to have been\n            substantially achieved. The outcome of the program is,\n            therefore, rated as satisfactory. The main lessons learned\n            are: 1) Design of engineering works under deadlines\n            appropriate for emergency works increases the risk of\n            under/over estimation of quantities and cost overruns; 2)\n            Public opposition to the alignment of retired embankments\n            was a significant factor in implementation delays; 3) Even\n            under emergency procedures, land acquisition bottlenecks can\n            cause significant implementation delays; 4) During the\n            planning phase, beneficiaries need to be involved in\n            deciding the provision of hydraulic structures; 5) Designs\n            for improvement and/or repairs to existing structures should\n            be done to minimize maintenance; 6) Contract management of\n            major civil works by consultants is efficient and improved\n            quality in civil works construction can be assured; 7) There\n            is a need for GOB to review its procurement procedures to\n            find ways to expedite decisions, particularly for emergency\n            operations; 8) The implementation of the foreshore\n            afforestation development under CERP should be given\n            priority; and 9) When financing a project of significant\n            size funded from several credits, an early decision should\n            be made to prepare separate supervision reports for such projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
