Given the current\n            political situation in Peru - a new government faced with a\n            divided Congress - it is still too early to anticipate\n            long-term lessons from the project, despite a beneficial\n            participation, and project coordination (including the\n            mobilization of additional resources, and real increases in\n            efficiency, and sustainability of reforms). Therefore,\n            implementation of the project's social reforms will\n            have to overcome resistance of diverse interest groups, and\n            be heavily dependent on the leadership provided by the\n            Government; not so much so on the role of the Bank, whose\n            ability to promote national consensus may be limited.\n            Moreover, the start-up costs are likely to be particularly\n            high, but such costs should be viewed rather as an\n            investment, where governments, and international donors\n            supporting social programs, should be prepared for a lengthy\n            gestation period, willing to accept the uncertainties\n            involved.

the Government of Peru. The social reform\n            program, will help build the bases for a transparent and\n            participatory resource allocation mechanism, rationalization\n            of expenditures, decentralized implementation, and\n            systematic performance-tracking of social programs. The PSRL\n            will be the first of two loans using a Programmatic\n            Structural Adjustment Loan instrument. In the short-term,\n            the first loan will emphasize safeguarding of critical\n            social expenditures especially beneficial to the poor during\n            a difficult fiscal adjustment and political transition\n            period. In the medium-term, it will also lay the groundwork\n            for medium-term reforms, including increasing capacity for\n            targeting and monitoring of poverty-alleviation programs,\n            launching public access to social expenditure information,\n            and unifying health and nutrition programs. A decision about\n            whether and when the second operation will depend on the\n            progress of the reform program. The reform program proceeds\n            to strengthen social control mechanisms, eliminate\n            duplication of programs, and increasingly provide incentives\n            for decentralization of social services. The Loan supports\n            the government's commitment to strengthen\n            anti-corruption efforts and to promote the empowerment of\n            civil society and the private sector while streamlining the\n            public sector's role in an open Peruvian society."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Programmatic Social Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru -
