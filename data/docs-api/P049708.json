Such projects\n            should also incorporate a strong monitoring system to adapt\n            to changing circumstances. Human resource projects of this\n            kind (where senior staff are 'parachuted in') are\n            both institutionally sensitive and complex to implement.\n            Expatriate recruitment projects would also be more effective\n            as part of a broader capacity building strategy based on\n            institutional assessments of need.
