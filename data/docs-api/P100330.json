Some lessons\n            learned included: coordination among donors in terms of\n            timing of support to the reforms and the investment loans\n            was and continues to be critical for the success of this\n            reform program. Since this operation was the first project\n            the Bank developed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) and\n            Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in the railway\n            sector, agreement to the same reform matrix for Bangladesh\n            Railway (BR) and signing of a memorandum of understanding\n            were important mechanisms to improve coordination. This was\n            further strengthened by joint supervision missions. In the\n            context of a country with limited implementation capacity\n            and considerable political uncertainties, opportunistic\n            reforms are needed, as is the case with Bangladesh. Triggers\n            for such operations have to be interpreted as indicative and\n            subject to change, provided of course the changes are\n            broadly consistent with the overall Government focus and are\n            also likely to contribute to the outcomes being pursued.\n            There is a need to maintain flexibility in the design and\n            implementation of reforms to take account of unforeseen\n            developments. Similarly being responsive to country\n            conditions requires that donors, such as the Bank, build\n            their engagement on reform initiatives that the government\n            has taken, to assist with those reform steps the government\n            can pursue in the near term, and to acknowledge that some\n            reforms will have to wait longer than others under different\n            political circumstances. Historically Bangladesh has not\n            been in the forefront of reformist economies and for more\n            than three decades now reforms have occurred in small rather\n            than big steps. Indeed very often reform successes need to\n            be judged on the basis of partial rather than full\n            implementation of all components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Railway
