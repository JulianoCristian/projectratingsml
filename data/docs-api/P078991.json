Some lessons learned includes: the\n            importance of surveillance and monitoring and evaluation\n            should not be underestimated. Given the challenges\n            associated with availability of data to monitor Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) indicators and intermediate\n            outcome indicators, the project could have had a stronger\n            focus, including dedicated financial resources, to\n            strengthen surveillance, monitoring and evaluation. The use\n            of national outcome indicators as PDO indicators was\n            problematic given that the project had a targeted approach.\n            While the use of common national targets for all donors was\n            helpful in terms of donor coordination and harmonization, it\n            was not appropriate to measure the success of this project\n            which featured interventions in targeted areas.\n            Notwithstanding the issues in monitoring and evaluation, the\n            project also demonstrated that the expansion of maternal\n            homes (Casas Maternas) made a critical contribution to\n            improving institutional deliveries. More generally, the\n            project demonstrated that a primary health care model based\n            on a basic package of services works in Nicaragua.\n            Performance agreements became a very useful tool to\n            establish a results-oriented culture. This was a powerful\n            tool that had a positive impact for managing decentralized\n            health programs. The project also proved that it is possible\n            to move from a situation of many models and sources of\n            financing to a coordinated sector approach. One final\n            lesson, however, is that pooling funds is very difficult.\n            The necessary conditions to allow for pooling of funds are\n            challenging, and in hindsight it may have been overly\n            optimistic given the country's capacity constraints and\n            fiduciary systems to expect that this could have been\n            possible from the start."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Second Phase Health Services\n            Extension and Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Second Phase Health\n

system. The project\n            has the following three components: Component 1) a package\n            of basic health care services (PBHS), focusing on maternal\n            and child health, will be offered to the most deprived\n            population of Nicaragua. Vulnerable populations and\n            localities for the extension of coverage have been\n            identified based on the following criteria: current access\n            to health services, level of poverty, and health status.\n            Component 2) this component of the Sector Wide Approach\n            (SWAp) is designed to support the extension of coverage, and\n            to complement its Maternal-Child Health (MCH)-related\n            activities. Activities in this area are aimed at creating an\n            effectively structured and functioning referral system that\n            will provide a more complete continuum of MCH care to rural\n            communities, while increasing their access to secondary care\n            and improving the overall quality of health care. Component\n            3) the Ministry of Health (MOH) recognizes that to fulfill\n            the vision set forth in the National Health Plan (NHP) and\n            effectively lead the SWAp, it
