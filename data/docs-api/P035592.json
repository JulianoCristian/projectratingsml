The Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) was designed to\n            support the reform program introduced by the Government.The\n            objectives of the ERC were: (i) to support the\n            Government's reform program, and more particularly the\n            measures aimed at minimizing the negative social impact of\n            the devaluation in the short tern; (ii) to provide necessary\n            financial aid for the transition period, while follow-up\n            operations were being prepared; and (iii) to continue the\n            policy dialogue between the Governrment and IDA. Three\n            lessons can be drawn from implementation of the ERC: First,\n            Government's firm commitment to the reform program was\n            a key element in the success of the operation. Second.\n            budgetary support in a single-tranche disbursement was a\n            satisfactory response to an emergency situation. Third, as\n            far as poverty reduction is concerned, specific mechanisms\n            for targeting vulnerable groups should be identified\n            beforehand so that the impact on such groups can be maximized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Economic Recovery Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Economic Recovery\n            Credit

12, 1994. By shoring up support for the\n            measures taken in the aftermath of the devaluation, the\n            Economic Recovery Credit Project is a crucial element in\n            helping to deepen the adjustment program the Senegalese\n            Government has been pursuing since August 1993. The previous\n            internal adjustment programs of the 1980s were supported by\n            four Structural Adjustment Credits (SAL I-IV) as well as by\n            the IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). The\n            credit will support the post-devaluation reform program as\n            outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policies, and, more particularly, the measures aiming\n            at minimizing the negative social impact of the devaluation\n            in the short term. The Government's program has also\n            obtained the support of and IMF Stand-by-arrangement. The\n            Senegalese Government has already taken a series of key\n            macroeconomic and structural measures to regain and\n            consolidate competitiveness. The Economic Recovery Credit\n            (ERC) is designed to support the implementation of these\n            measures in 1994. The main measures are: (i) devaluation of\n            the CFA Franc from 50 CFAF to 100 CFAF/1 FF; (ii) increase\n            in key producer prices (groundnuts, cotton); (iii) a\n            substantial program of social measures to attenuate the\n            effects of the devaluation on the vulnerable groups; (iv)\n            prudent demand management policies to reduce absorption by\n            the public sector and limit wage increases; (v) reduction\n            and simplification of tariffs and domestic taxation; and\n            (vi) protection of social sector expenditures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Economic Recovery Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Economic Recovery\n            Credit
