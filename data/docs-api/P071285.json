The RWSSP II, was able not only to\n            address the implementation issues which affected the first\n            project, but also to experiment and pilot innovations. These\n            innovations allowed the RWSS program to grow and evolve, and\n            could not have been introduced under the first project,\n            which focused on developing the foundations of the Fund\n            Board\u0092s delivery model. The project had a remarkable gender\n            impact by freeing women and girls of the time previously\n            spent fetching water to distant locations. The Fund Board\n            would need to reorient to address the emerging trends of\n            growing demand for improved service levels in rural areas\n            development phase of the Fund Board\u0092s delivery model, during\n            which communities are mobilized, and community decisions are\n            made, is a unique feature and an important investment that\n
