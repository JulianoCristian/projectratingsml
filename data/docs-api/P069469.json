Positive lessons point at the critical\n            Bank's advisory role to the United Nations Interim\n            Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), financing and guiding\n            other donors, and particularly important in the provision of\n            budget support, and assessment of the budget. Likewise,\n            ownership by the authorities, and selectivity in\n            conditionality was important for the success of the project,\n            as the Bank, and UNMIK concentrated on policy matters for\n            immediate recovery, laying the foundation for long-term\n            sustainability, i.e., initiation of public finance, the\n            banking system, and trade flows. However, the Bank has\n            highlighted that the technical details of the operation,\n            need further careful negotiation when the authority is\n            segmented, and also outlines both the flexibility provided\n            by single-tranche operations, as well as their shortcomings,\n            in particular monitoring implementation of the commitments\n            in the Letters of Development Policies. Moreover,\n            retrospectively it is clear that it would have been better\n            to keep banking supervision, and payments operations in\n            separate institutions - as indeed the Bank had advised; it\n            would have also been better to start with fewer tariff\n            exemptions; and, an earlier focusing on municipal financing\n            would have been recommendable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -\n            Kosovo Economic Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of\n
