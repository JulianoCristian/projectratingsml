The key lessons learned suggest that: 1)\n            Project design should ensure long-term sustainability of\n            investments, thus up-front institutional arrangements should\n            be agreed early on, and, strong emphasis should be laid on a\n            balanced investment - balance between production,\n            distribution systems, and its operation/maintenance\n            activities. This implies Bank financing should focus on\n            complete works, rather than supply items, as proven by the\n            successful installation, which was left to the Borrower,\n            and, provision for complementary sewerage systems should be\n            ensured for water projects. 2) Policy sector reforms\n            require, broad-based and comprehensive emphasis on autonomy,\n            and private sector participation, particularly for\n            institutional, and financial successful performances. This\n            allowed the Borrower to contribute significantly to project\n            sustainability, and mobilize finances for needed future\n            investments. 3) Implementation requires flexible responses\n            to changing conditions, which may otherwise face delays,\n            either in the provision of local currency funds, or cause\n            serious implementation interruptions. Close cooperation with\n            the Government and donors, will increase efficiency, as will\n            a proactive Bank management, and restructuring practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen -

the\n            water supply in the town of Tarim and adjacent villages.\n            The project consists of three main components.  The water\n            supply components are: (a) to drill and equip a new\n            borefield near Tarim; (b) to construct water storage\n            reservoirs and a distribution system in Tarim and adjacent\n            villages; (c) to provide water meters, tools, and\n            operational equipment; and (d) to provide technical\n            assistance for construction supervision, the establishment\n            of management information and inventory control system, and\n            to devise a manpower development program and training.  The\n            sewerage sector components are: (a) a pilot wastewater\n            demonstration project; (b) a financing and cost recovery\n            study of the sewerage sector; (c) to update sewerage\n            designs; and (d) training.  Another component is a training\n            program in accounting and auditing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"People's Democratic Republic of Yemen -\n            Tarim Water Supply
