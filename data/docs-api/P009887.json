The original objectives of  the project were to: (a)\n            expand family welfare services with emphasis on maternal and\n            child health, birth spacing, and increased use of temporary\n            contraceptive methods; (b) improve the quality of family\n            welfare services; (c) strengthen the capacity of Greater\n            Bombay, Madras city and the Chingleput district in Tamil\n            Nadu to plan, manage and implement family welfare programs\n            in urban areas; and (d) increase the participation of\n            Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs) and private medical\n            practitioners (PMPs) in urban family welfare programs.\n            Bank\u2019s performance was good. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned in the project were:\n            (i) the choice of implementing agency is an important\n            determinant of success; (ii) successful project objectives\n            should ensure high staff morale and active beneficiary\n            participation; and (iii) allotting a subordinate role to the\n            private and voluntary sector can lead to disappointing\n            results. The future operation of the services supported by\n            the project seems assured in both major cities and the other municipalities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Fifth (Bombay and Madras) Population Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -
