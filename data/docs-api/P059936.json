Some lessons\n            learned included: tailored public information and awareness\n            rising are essential for community participation,\n            accountability and investments ownership - NMPRP managed to\n            develop an effective communication strategy up to the\n            commune level. Efforts were made to reach vulnerable groups\n            including non literate people at village's levels but\n            results seemed to vary between communes. Information must be\n            tailored as appropriate to diverse target groups and\n            audiences with different backgrounds in terms of ethnicity,\n            age, gender and social status. A variety of communication\n            media should be employed. Transparent, competitive and\n            decentralized procurement methods are most likely to provide\n            assurance of cost effectiveness and efficiency for small\n            scale infrastructure component at local levels. This\n            includes social audit function of community level oversight\n            over procurement decisions, etc. For very small, labor\n            intensive works at village level for which locally available\n            materials and skills are required, community participation\n            in procurement helps build local capacity, creates\n            employment and reduces costs. Strong institutional reform\n            and leadership of the coordinating agency is essential to\n            project success and sustainability. The strong ownership and\n            coordinating leadership of the Ministry of Planning and\n            Investment (MPI) has enabled a series of institutional and\n            regular reforms (circulars, staff commitment and capacity\n            building) which greatly influenced the project performance.\n            Coordination between institutional actors, information\n            dissemination and program management capacity is a key\n            factor for the success of integrated, sustainable local\n            development programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Northern
