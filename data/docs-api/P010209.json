The\n            project has achieved most of its objectives, institutional\n            capacity is being strengthened, sustainability is likely,\n            and both the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            there is a need to integrate and mainstream financing\n            arrangements for monitoring and evaluation in order to\n            demonstrate the conviction of the Borrower and donors that\n            it is a mainline activity, while paying sufficient attention\n            to the design of the M&E program. Second, there is a\n            need to clearly define benchmarks for measuring interim\n            outcomes and assessing potential impacts for projects with\n            long implementation periods, so that there is no need to\n            wait until completion in order to determine likely outcomes.\n            Third, explicit performance indicators should be set.\n            Fourth, careful consideration should be given to the\n            technical and political feasibility, and financial\n            justification of financing dams and reservoirs if they\n            involve resettlement. Lastly, there is a need to ensure the\n            capacity of implementing agencies to carry out the\n            resettlement program as mandated by Bank policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Left Bank Outfall Drain Stage-1 Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -

(b) installation of a\n            surface and subsurface drainage network in the three\n            subareas; and (c) installation of a power distribution\n            system to supply the drainage tubewells and drain pumps.\n            The project further provides for:  (d) introduction of\n            on-farm water management practices including renovation of\n            about 920 watercourses and precision land levelling; (e)\n            remodelling of the Nara and Jamrao Canals, as well as\n            construction of the Chotiari Reservoir, to provide\n            supplemental irrigation water for the project area.\n            Finally, the project includes; (f) technical assistance for\n            project design and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Left Bank Outfall Drain (Stage I) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Left Bank Outfall\n            Drain (Stage I) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/11/741487/pakistan-left-bank-outfall-drain-stage-project","projn":"PK-Left Bank Outfall Dr -- P010209","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Crops and Crop Management Systems,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Agriculture","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970904163533"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abandonment,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural extension,Agricultural\n            Inputs,agricultural output,agricultural pricing\n            policies,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,alluvium,aquifer,Audits,Average annual\n            rainfall,bar,Basin,Bifurcation,bund,calcium,Canal\n            systems,canals,capillary rise,catchment,catchment\n            area,channel,channels,clay,Conductivity,construction,crop,Crop\n            Production,crop yields,cropping,Cropping\n            Intensity,Crops,cultivated land,cultivation,deep\n            percolation,discharge,double\n            cropping,Drain,Drainage,drainage network,Drainage\n            System,drains,effective\n            capacity,effluent,equipment,erosion,Evaporation,farm,FARM\n            INCOMES,farm\n            land,Farmer,farmers,farming,Fertilizer,Fertilizer\n            use,fertilizers,fiber crops,flooding,ginneries,Grain,Grain\n            Storage,groundwater,high-yielding\n            varieties,imports,infiltration,irrigated\n            agriculture,Irrigation,Irrigation Systems,irrigation\n            water,labor force,land ownership,Land\n            Use,Mangoes,MARKETING,oilseeds,pest\n            control,pesticide,pesticides,population growth,private\n            sector,Programs,pulses,pumping,pumping\n            stations,pumps,reservoirs,rice,salinity,sea,sediment,Seed,Seed\n            Cotton,seed industry,seed production,seeds,seepage,silt,soil\n            analysis,soil moisture,soil moisture storage,Soils,storm\n            runoff,storms,stratification,Sugar,sugarcane,Water\n            Balance,Water Requirements,water resources,wells,Wheat,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"abandonment,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural extension,Agricultural\n            Inputs,agricultural output,agricultural pricing\n            policies,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,alluvium,aquifer,Audits,Average annual\n            rainfall,bar,Basin,Bifurcation,bund,calcium,Canal\n            systems,canals,capillary rise,catchment,catchment\n            area,channel,channels,clay,Conductivity,construction,crop,Crop\n            Production,crop yields,cropping,Cropping\n            Intensity,Crops,cultivated land,cultivation,deep\n            percolation,discharge,double\n            cropping,Drain,Drainage,drainage network,Drainage\n            System,drains,effective\n            capacity,effluent,equipment,erosion,Evaporation,farm,FARM\n            INCOMES,farm\n            land,Farmer,farmers,farming,Fertilizer,Fertilizer\n            use,fertilizers,fiber crops,flooding,ginneries,Grain,Grain\n            Storage,groundwater,high-yielding\n            varieties,imports,infiltration,irrigated\n            agriculture,Irrigation,Irrigation Systems,irrigation\n            water,labor force,land ownership,Land\n            Use,Mangoes,MARKETING,oilseeds,pest\n            control,pesticide,pesticides,population growth,private\n            sector,Programs,pulses,pumping,pumping\n            stations,pumps,reservoirs,rice,salinity,sea,sediment,Seed,Seed\n            Cotton,seed industry,seed production,seeds,seepage,silt,soil\n            analysis,soil moisture,soil moisture storage,Soils,storm\n            runoff,storms,stratification,Sugar,sugarcane,Water\n            Balance,Water Requirements,water resources,wells,Wheat,Yields"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021840-LEFT BANK OUTFALL DRAIN(CIDA,UK,SDC)","repnb":"5185"},"facets":{}}}
