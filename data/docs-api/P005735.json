Some lessons learned\n            included: GoT did not comply at the later stages of project\n            implementation with its commitment to adjust electricity\n            tariffs and Bank management was reluctant to enforce the\n            corresponding covenants. Bank management and staff should\n            strictly enforce compliance with critical covenants to\n            prevent the project from departing from some of its\n            institutional objectives as well as to preserve the\n            Bank's credibility, irrespective of considerations such\n            as closing dates. The conversion component of the project\n            did not include a well-defined description and targets. As a\n            result, only four (out of fourteen) industrial undertakings\n            were able to convert their facilities to use gas. In\n            general, the project design should very detailed and\n            comprehensive. In particular, this project component should\n            have explicitly defined, based on a sound survey, a\n            realistic program and the type and number of conversions to\n            be achieved each year. Detailed and comprehensive project\n            description and implementation targets are essential. The\n            lessons from previous gas projects in Tunisia, in particular\n            those concerning pricing policies and compliance with the\n            commitment to adjust tariffs, should have been taken into\n            account in preparing and implementing the project. Under\n            Loan 3418-TUN, the Bank should have required from GoT to\n            increase power tariffs and lower retail prices for gas to\n            economic levels, all as an up front condition for approval\n            of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Gas Infrastructure Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Gas Infrastructure\n

As a result, the Gabes region, the main\n            industrial center in southern Tunisia, will face a\n            significant energy supply deficit by 1993, since it depends\n            on this associated gas for fuel supply. Bank analyses have\n            confirmed that it would be more economic to continue to\n            supply Gabes and its region with natural gas rather than\n            convert existing industries to fuel oil and transfer some of\n            STEG's (Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas) power\n            generation facilities in Gabes further north on the TMP\n            (Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline).

Gas Infrastructure Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Associated gas production from the\n            El-Borma oil field is declining rapidly as this field nears\n            depletion. As a result, the Gabes region, the main\n            industrial center in southern Tunisia, will face a\n            significant energy supply deficit by 1993, since it depends\n            on this associated gas for fuel supply. Bank analyses have\n            confirmed that it would be more economic to continue to\n            supply Gabes and its region with natural gas rather than\n            convert existing industries to fuel oil and transfer some of\n            STEG's (Tunisian Company for Electricity and Gas) power\n            generation facilities in Gabes further north on the TMP\n            (Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline). The project will provide a\n            least-cost energy supply alternative for Gabes and other gas\n            markets along the pipeline route. A gas infrastructure\n            network in the southern part of the country to facilitate\n            domestic gas field development will be established. The\n            increased use of natural gas in the industrial and premium\n            fuels markets will be promoted. In addition, the project\n            will develop a sound gas subsector strategy while\n            rationalizing and strengthening the subsector's\n            institutional model.
