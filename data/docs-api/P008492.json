The objectives of the project were as follows: (a)\n            reducing the role of the state in the economy( reduction of\n            administrative intervention in resource allocation, the size\n            of the state-owned enterprise  sector, transfers and taxes);\n            (b) intensifying competition( import and price\n            liberalization, developing strict bankruptcy law); (c)\n            reforming the financial sector, within the framework of a\n            new Banking Law (liberalization, improved prudential\n            regulations, and enhanced supervision); and (d) establishing\n            a financially viable and well targeted social safety net.\n            The Bank's performance was highly satisfactory in\n            project identification, preparation assistance, and\n            appraisal and Bank's supervision was satisfactory.\n            Borrower performance during preparation was highly\n            satisfactory however, the Borrower performance in\n            implementing the project should be considered, on balance,\n            as mixed. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            prudent macroeconomic management is crucial to the success\n            of transformation; (ii) partial implementation of a reform\n            package may not allow for overall satisfactory results;\n            (iii) reforms of the public sector in transition economies\n            are even more difficult to implement than the initial\n            liberalization and building of competitive markets; and (iv)\n            transition economies remain strongly vulnerable to the\n            external environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary

The objective of the reforms is to\n            establish a competitive market economy in Hungary, and to\n            preserve Hungary's external creditworthiness. The\n            program has four main components: (a) reduction of the role\n            of the state -- regarding ownership of productive assets,\n            the extent of administrative intervention in resource\n            allocation, and the amount of resources redistributed\n            through taxes and transfers; (b) intensification of\n            competition, by way of further liberalization, the promotion\n            of new private ventures, implementation of effective\n            anti-trust action against enterprises engaged in unfair and\n            restrictive practices, and tightening of financial\n            discipline through the financial system and strengthened\n            bankruptcy procedures; (c) financial sector reform, through\n            further liberalization, implementation of improved\n            prudential regulation and tighter supervision, and\n            restructuring of insolvent banks; and (d) establishment of\n            financially viable well-targeted, and efficient programs of\n            social assistance to alleviate the social costs of\n            adjustment and to provide an adequate social safety net that\n
