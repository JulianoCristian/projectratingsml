Agricultural Sector Adjustment Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This is the Project Completion Report\n            (PCR) for the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Operation\n            (ASAO) in Kenya. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Kenyan\n            economy had large financial imbalances, resulting from a\n            deterioration of external terms of trade following the\n            second oil shock, and an erosion of fiscal discipline.\n            Domestic demand exceeded domestic supply, government\n            expenditures exceeded revenues, and imports exceeded\n            exports. During the early 1980s, economic growth was\n            erratic, and the slow growth of agriculture was a particular\n            cause of concern because of the critical links between\n            agriculture and the rest of the economy. The project\n            objectives can be stated as follows: Taking overall growth\n            strategy as its starting point, the ASAO was growth-oriented\n            and included key actions to assist government implement\n            three inter-related strategies: intensifying production\n            through increased supplies of key inputs; enhanced producer\n            incentives and market de-regulation; and improved allocation\n            and efficiency of sectoral public investments and\n            expenditures. The quality and speed of ASAO implementation\n            suffered after an initial satisfactory phase. Towards the\n            latter part of the implementation period in 1987, the\n            Government appeared to be more committed to fulfilling the\n            vaguely defined conditions for tranche release, than to full\n            implementation of a reform program. While the direction of\n            the policy reforms has remained on track in most areas, the\n            timeliness and extent of full implementation have fallen\n            short of expectations. The six main lessons related to the\n            project are in the following areas: (a) Government\n            commitment and sustainability ;( b) program design; (c)\n            disbursements and allocation of funds; (d) implementation\n            and coordination arrangements; (e) complementarity with\n            other investments and programs; and (f) the usefulness of\n            ASAO as an instrument for mobilizing multi-donor support\n            within a policy framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -

The principal\n            objectives of the program are to stimulate sectoral growth\n            through promoting intensification of production and better\n            use of Kenya's limited land; improve producer\n            incentives; and expand the flow of investment resources to\n            the sector.  Above all, the program is geared to lifting the\n            obstacles to increased production by the 1.9 million\n            smallholder farm families who are the backbone of\n            Kenya's agricultural sector.  To achieve these\n            objectives, actions have been taken and others will be\n            implemented in the following two years. They will include\n            (i) improving the availability of key agricultural inputs\n            and services; (ii) increasing production and investment\n            incentives, (iii) implementing programs to address critical\n            parastatal problems; (iv) launching a major restructuring of\n            the public investment and expenditure program; and (v)\n            increasing flows of credit and expanding access to credit,\n            particularly for smallholders.  The foreign exchange\n            provided by the Credits will be used to finance an agreed\n            program of imports of inputs needed for the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Agricultural
