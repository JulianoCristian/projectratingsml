Some lessons learned included: in view of\n            the institutional environment at the time of preparation,\n            Government resisted the idea of merging two projects under\n            the umbrella of PNGTER (Projet National de Gestion des\n            Terroirs et Equipment Rural - Rural Land Management and\n            Community Infrastructure Development Project). Had the Bank\n            accepted this to finance separate projects, the impact will\n            likely have improved for both objectives. Bank teams should\n            make sure that institutional arrangements are realistic,\n            achievable and acceptable to the government. It took seven\n            years to convince the government to authorize the transfer\n            of funds to communities. In cases like this where the\n            Borrower is unwilling to move forward, tough decisions must\n            be made on whether or not to proceed. Despite active\n            community participation in local development planning,\n            discussions during development of the Bank's country\n            partnership strategy and the Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) mission revealed that there was generally a\n            poor understanding of projects financed by the Bank. A lack\n            of clarity on the roles and responsibilities of\n            beneficiaries is likely one factor for the poor performance\n            of PNGTER. An important lesson learned is the necessity for\n            Bank-financed projects to respect their commitment to\n            accompany the Government in the implementation of its\n            policies. The PNGTER had the mission to help Government\n            implement its decentralization policy and land tenure\n            reforms. However, the institutional link between the project\n            and national programs was tenuous at best, and PNGTER\n            operated largely independently, without coordination at a\n            higher level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -

Potential negative environmental impacts\n            resulting from the infrastructure- or agriculture-related\n            project activities of the PNGTER will be mitigated or\n            avoided entirely by emphasizing social, environmental,\n            economic, and cultural factors in community planning and\n            decisionmaking. Impacts that arise from rural road\n            rehabilitation will be mitigated by rehabilitating quarries,\n            creating drainage systems, clarifying land tenure, and\n            reverting to community-based land management. Impacts\n            arising from building small dams and levies, including\n            altering downstream water flows and siltation, will be\n            mitigated by properly dimensioning dams and levies, and\n            introducing erosion control measures in watersheds. Soil\n            depletion and erosion caused by intensifying agricultural\n            practices will similarly be alleviated by watershed control\n            measures, improving fallow, afforestation, and using cover\n            crops. The loss of biodiversity and hydrological regulation,\n            irreversible soil damage, and the lowering of the water\n            table will be avoided by land use preserving a portion of\n            vegetation, careful drainage of organic soils, and careful\n            placement of irrigation infrastructure. Soil and water\n            contamination, health hazards, and utrophication of\n            freshwater bodies resulting from increased chemical use will\n            be reduced by improving the organic matter content in soils,\n            training in application techniques, pesticide control,\n            educating the local population on pesticide use, and\n            protecting sensitive water bodies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Plan de gestion des pestes et des pesticides"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Plan de gestion des pestes et des\n            pesticides (Vol. 3)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/05/10823373/cote-divoire-rural-land-management-community-infrastructure-development-project-environmental-assessment-vol-3-plan-de-gestion-des-pestes-des-pesticides","projn":"CI-Ivc Pngter Rural Land Management -- P001194","subtopic":"Administrative & Regulatory Law,Water Resources Management,Climate Change and Environment,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Social Development","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","authors":{"authr":"Cote d'Ivoire"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20090716021043"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-1","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Social Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Community participation;

(b) strengthen local capacity to\n            plan, make decisions, govern and manage affairs at the local\n            level; and (c) support small-scale investments for\n            sustainable natural resource management, agriculture and\n            infrastructure development, to be undertaken collaboratively\n            by government and local communities. There are five\n            components to the project. Component one: clarifying land\n            tenure. This component will remain intact. That is, it will\n            help secure land rights and develop private and government\n            capacity to survey land and provide titles to interested\n            right holders.

The\n            component on local participatory planning (enhancement of\n            local management capacity) and the related financing\n            component (local investments) will be combined.

Potential negative environmental impacts\n            resulting from the infrastructure- or agriculture-related\n            project activities of the PNGTER will be mitigated or\n            avoided entirely by emphasizing social, environmental,\n            economic, and cultural factors in community planning and\n            decisionmaking. Impacts that arise from rural road\n            rehabilitation will be mitigated by rehabilitating quarries,\n            creating drainage systems, clarifying land tenure, and\n            reverting to community-based land management. Impacts\n            arising from building small dams and levies, including\n            altering downstream water flows and siltation, will be\n            mitigated by properly dimensioning dams and levies, and\n            introducing erosion control measures in watersheds. Soil\n            depletion and erosion caused by intensifying agricultural\n            practices will similarly be alleviated by watershed control\n            measures, improving fallow, afforestation, and using cover\n            crops. The loss of biodiversity and hydrological regulation,\n            irreversible soil damage, and the lowering of the water\n            table will be avoided by land use preserving a portion of\n            vegetation, careful drainage of organic soils, and careful\n            placement of irrigation infrastructure. Soil and water\n            contamination, health hazards, and utrophication of\n            freshwater bodies resulting from increased chemical use will\n            be reduced by improving the organic matter content in soils,\n            training in application techniques, pesticide control,\n            educating the local population on pesticide use, and\n            protecting sensitive water bodies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cadre de politique de reinstallation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire - Projet de gestion\n            des terres rurales et de d\u00e9veloppement des infrastructures\n            communautaires\u00a0: \u00e9valuation environnementale (Vol. 2) :\n            Cadre de politique de r\u00e9installation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/06/10823368/cote-divoire-rural-land-management-community-infrastructure-development-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-cadre-de-politique-de-reinstallation","projn":"CI-Ivc Pngter Rural Land Management -- P001194","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Administrative & Regulatory Law,Climate Change and Environment,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment,Water Resources,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Social Development","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","authors":{"authr":"Cote d'Ivoire"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20090716015524"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-1","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Resources,Law and Development,Poverty Reduction,Social Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Community participation;
