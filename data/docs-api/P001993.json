The major objectives of the project were the\n            following: (a) create, at least temporarily, new employment\n            in urban areas using the private sector, and thereby\n            stimulating small local private contractors and consulting\n            firms; (b) improve the individual skills of workers and the\n            competitiveness of the firms involved; (c) demonstrate the\n            feasibility of labor-intensive projects and to test\n            procedures that will allow the public sector to commission\n            economically and socially useful projects; and (d) review\n            existing public works programs and recast them with the\n            intent of speeding up their implementation and enhancing\n            their overall performance. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (a) an autonomous\n            agency with its own statutes, such as the Nigetip agency, is\n            fully capable of carrying out public works, quickly and\n            effectively, by relying entirely on domestic human\n            resources; (b) the links between Nigetip and the sectoral\n            programs or projects should serve to strengthen project\n            management, especially at the municipal level, and these\n            links need to be clearly thought out before the agreement\n            delegating that management is drawn up; (c) quality is an\n            important consideration in selecting sub-projects; and (d)\n            grass-roots community participation must be assured if\n            sub-projects are to be sustainable, and if there is to be a\n            proper match between the problem and the nature of the\n            response to it, in particular with respect to the cost of\n            the investment and its maintenance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Public Works and Employment
