Ratings for the Second\n            Health Sector Reform Project are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was negligible\n            low; and the performance of the Bank and the Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from the projects included: 1)\n            the political economy of health sector reform inevitably\n            creates both winners and losers. Early and comprehensive\n            anticipation of stakeholder interests, institutional\n            analysis to facilitate understanding of those interests, and\n            the generation of a coherent plan to build support for\n            reform and to persuade and/or co-opt potential opponents is\n            essential; 2) the Bank should not, however, underestimate\n            the potential leverage wielded by its financing and\n            expertise; 3) one effective mechanism for countering\n            political resistance to reform is strong and consistent\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), where analytic results\n            can be generated and disseminated rapidly and effectively,\n            building support for project activities in a politically\n            contentious environment; 4) another important tool for\n            overcoming political resistance to reform is the engagement\n            with civil society organizations that give health\n            professionals and users of the health care system a voice in\n            the decision process and a clear sense of affiliation and\n            identity; and 5) tradeoffs between efficiency,\n            equity/access, and quality of care will not be addressed in\n            the absence of explicit and consistent attention to the\n            balance between them and interventions to correct imbalances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Health Sector Reform;\n            Second Health Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic

       Reform Project in Kyrgyz Republic were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included: 1) Sound quality at entry is critical; design must\n            be supported by solid analytical work; piloting smaller\n            scale operations and reforms can help build capacity and\n            stakeholder support; 2) Strong Government ownership is not\n            sufficient, it must be backed up with resources and budget\n            execution must be synchronized with health reforms; 3)\n            Explicit assessment of political risks could provide\n            guidance to teams embarking on projects that support\n            reforms; 4) A lesson on how to undertake health sector\n            reforms is that sometimes complex designs are necessary and\n            a broader approach could be the only way to achieve the\n            expected outcomes. This means that within the Bank, teams\n            from different sectors need better coordination that would\n            allow for full use of instruments and within a country\n            better alignment of frameworks is a must; 5) In a developing\n            sector supported by a large number of donors; successful\n            donor coordination is critical for successful comprehensive\n            reforms and; 6) When health reforms change the role of the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) to one of stewardship, focus must\n            also be on institutional development and governance. As a\n            steward of health care, more transparency and accountability\n            become expected. This means that MOH and the sector as a\n            whole need stronger and transparent fiduciary function\n            (procurement, financial management)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic -
