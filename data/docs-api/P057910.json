Lessons learned from the\n            project: PARSEP (I) is an excellent endorsement of the old\n            LIL model, one which allowed the flexibility to learn by\n            doing. Its success in fact raises questions as to the new\n            LIL format, actions based on a driving hypothesis, because\n            had it followed that model, it would not have achieved as\n            much as it did.

It\n            is also to assist the Federal and Sate Governments to choose\n            from among the best options and encourage them to implement\n            sound reforms. State pension reform comprises four phases:\n            (a) technical preparedness and diagnostic; (b) elaboration\n            of pension reform proposals; (c) design of required\n            institutional framework; and (d) implementation of reform\n            proposals. The first project component addresses the\n            adaptation of the Pension Reform Options Simulation Toolkit\n            (PROST) to Brazilian reality. The second project component\n            addresses the training of Federal and state employees in\n            pension management and reform and in PROST through the\n            support of consultants and workshops. The third project\n            component addresses government activities, such as studies\n            and dissemination of best case Pension fund management and\n            Federal pension obligations and the design of an information\n            system linking the Ministry of Social Security and Social\n            Assistance with states' pension data bases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - State Pension Reform Technical\n            Assistance Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - State Pension Reform\n            Technical Assistance Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/442117/brazil-state-pension-reform-technical-assistance-loan-project","projn":"BR-Pension Reform Lil -- P057910","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Economic Stabilization,National Governance,Regional Governance,Pensions & Retirement Systems,Enterprise Development & Reform","teratopic":"Social Protections and Labor","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980901092413"},"subsc":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-3","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Protections and Labor","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"borrowing,budgeting,constituencies,constituency,Constitutional\n            reform,Executing agencies,Federal Government,Financial\n            Management,financial resources,financial support,financial\n            systems,fiscal,fiscal adjustment,fiscal burden,fiscal\n            reform,fiscal situation,funded systems,government\n            debt,Government Decrees,Government officials,Government\n            strategy,institutional framework,institutional reforms,labor\n            market,labor market efficiency,legislation,Ministries of\n            Finance,Ministry of Finance,municipalities,Pension\n            Administration,pension agency,pension debt,Pension\n            fund,Pension fund management,pension funds,pension\n            liabilities,pension modeling,Pension obligations,Pension\n            Reform,pension reforms,pension schemes,pension\n            system,PENSION SYSTEMS,pensioners,Pensions,performance\n            indicators,Project management,quality of\n            work,representatives,Service charge,Social Security,State\n            Agencies,state agency,state employees,State Finance,State\n            Government,State Governments,state officials,state reforms"},"1":{"cdata!":"borrowing,budgeting,constituencies,constituency,Constitutional\n            reform,Executing agencies,Federal Government,Financial\n            Management,financial resources,financial support,financial\n            systems,fiscal,fiscal adjustment,fiscal burden,fiscal\n            reform,fiscal situation,funded systems,government\n            debt,Government Decrees,Government officials,Government\n            strategy,institutional framework,institutional reforms,labor\n            market,labor market efficiency,legislation,Ministries of\n            Finance,Ministry of Finance,municipalities,Pension\n            Administration,pension agency,pension debt,Pension\n            fund,Pension fund management,pension funds,pension\n            liabilities,pension modeling,Pension obligations,Pension\n            Reform,pension reforms,pension schemes,pension\n            system,PENSION SYSTEMS,pensioners,Pensions,performance\n            indicators,Project management,quality of\n            work,representatives,Service charge,Social Security,State\n            Agencies,state agency,state employees,State Finance,State\n            Government,State Governments,state officials,state reforms"}},"owner":"Public Sector (LCSPS)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"17965"},"facets":{}}}
