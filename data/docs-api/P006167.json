The\n            sustainability of the results of the railway component, its\n            full commercialization, appears robust, based on the\n            satisfactory results initially obtained by the new private\n            operator and the reasonable prospects for a share of the\n            transport market in the medium term.  Project preparation\n            benefited from previous sectoral studies regarding the\n            access of Bolivian products to export markets and the extent\n            to which the transport infrastructure had become an\n            impediment to facilitate exports, through high costs or\n            sheer lack of infrastructure. With regard to the railway\n            component, ENFE's performance was unsatisfactory.  The\n            project's overall outcome has been satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be derived from the implementation this\n            project and from the major institutional reform that took\n            place between 995-1996. The lessons discussed below pertain\n            to issues related to the implementation of institutional\n            reform, the design of institutional building programs, and\n            the impact of reforms on the restructuring of the road\n            sub-sector. Lessons are also drawn from the factors that\n            affected project implementation. The experience in\n            implementing Bolivia's institutional reforms confirms\n            that reform processes when undertaken without a clear\n            consensus, with no pre-defined strategies, rarely produce\n            the intended results. In the case of Bolivia, the\n            application of the ADL to the road sub-sector adopted a\n            \u0091top-down\u0092 approach, imposing particular outcomes on the\n            sub-sectoral institutions, with limited dialogue involved.\n            It also lacked a specific strategy. The experiences how\u0092s\n            that it is not enough to pass legislation. It is also\n            necessary to internalize strategies and concepts, and to\n            define an incremental process which will permit adaptation\n            in light of acquired practice and institutional capacities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Export Corridors Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Export Corridors
