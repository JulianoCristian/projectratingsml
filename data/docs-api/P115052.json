Some lessons learned included: capacity\n            building of an implementing agency responsible for a\n            nationwide Community-Driven Development (CDD) program\n            requires substantial time and effort. Capacity building of\n            communities is a long-term and iterative process which over\n            time may lead to inclusive and transparent decision making.\n            Project guidelines (procurement, financial management,\n            implementation cycle, etc) have to evolve to take into\n            account changing community competencies. Project managers\n            must avoid to overload such guidelines and to make them too\n            bureaucratic. A robust Management Information System (MIS)\n            is essential for a nationwide CDD program. Although the\n            project was able to monitor progress against its Key\n            Performance Indicator (KPIs) by surveys and studies\n            (augmented by processed MIS data), a publicly accessible\n            system that presents reliable and regularly updated\n            information is needed to instill a culture of accountability\n            and transparency at all levels of project implementation.\n            Pre-financing of block grants by Government of Indonesia\n            (GoI) is effective. This approach was pioneered by the\n            project and resulted in a significant reduction in delays in\n            disbursement of block grants compared to Program Nasional\n            Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (PNPM) rural first and second. The\n            quality of facilitators is the main driver of\n            community-based project implementation quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Third National Program for\n

There\n            are four particularly important concerns in how the project\n            approaches indigenous communities: (i) developing\n            dissemination and facilitation materials in collaboration\n            with local communities (issues of language, graphics, etc);\n            (ii) using appropriate, inclusive self decision-making\n            mechanisms in environments where indigenous groups are\n            politically and culturally marginalized; (i.e. the Papua\n            Program); (iii) finding a balance so that groups (i.e.\n            women) excluded from traditional institutions can also join\n            project processes; and (iv) since Kecamatan Development\n            Program (KDP), the project included several adaptations to\n            address concerns that marginalized indigenous groups are\n            especially vulnerable to problems of elite domination and\n            corruption (by recruiting and training of facilitators from\n            these communities, providing special logistical support for\n            geographically and socially difficult area, having two\n            village facilitators (a man and a woman) trained and\n            mentored to allow them to gradually in charge for village\n            meetings under PNPM rural planning and accountability\n            meetings, village proposal writing team and village\n            implementation committee comprise village elected team, etc)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Isolated and vulnerable peoples planning framework"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Third National\n            Community Empowerment Program in Rural Areas Project :\n            indigenous peoples plan (Vol. 2) : Isolated and vulnerable\n            peoples planning framework"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/07/12582156/indonesia-third-national-community-empowerment-program-rural-areas-project-indigenous-peoples-plan-vol-2-isolated-vulnerable-peoples-planning-framework","projn":"ID-Third National Program For Community\n            Empowerment In Rural Areas -- P115052","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","subtopic":"Rural Urban Linkages,Population Policies,Social Accountability,Community Development and Empowerment,Housing & Human Habitats","teratopic":"Social Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100726021329"},"theme":"Decentralization,Social safety nets,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Participation and civic engagement","subsc":"Irrigation and drainage,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Primary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, beneficiaries,\n            collaboration, communities, Community Empowerment, community\n            meetings, consensus, consultation, consultations,\n            corruption, dissemination, district level, facilitators,\n            flexibility, grassroots participation, immigrants,\n            indigenous groups, Indigenous People, Indigenous Peoples,\n            local communities, Local governments, natural resources,\n            Policy Framework, preparation, project design,\n            reconstruction, respect, Rural Areas, rural communities,\n            Rural planning, social assessment, social organization,\n            social structures, traditional leaders, village, village\n            level, village meetings, villager, villagers, Villages,\n            vulnerability, vulnerable groups, woman"}},"owner":"Indonesia Sustainable Devlpmnt (EASIS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"IPP418"},"facets":{}}}
