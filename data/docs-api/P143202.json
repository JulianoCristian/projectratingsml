This entails starting with cash\n            transfer programs, quick disbursements, etc., that gain\n            momentum rapidly and reach their peak during one year; (7)\n            Submission of detailed supporting documents and original\n            receipts is not ideal for emergency operations, or for\n            speedy disbursements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -
