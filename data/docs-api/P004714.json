- Provincial Water Supply Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project includes improvement of\n            about 140 water supply systems in provincial urban areas\n            which were acquired by PWWA when it was created in early\n            1979. About one million people would receive improved water\n            service and one half million people would receive service\n            for the first time. The project will also provide advisory\n            services to PWWA in the fields of water system operation and\n            maintenance and in financial management, and will finance\n            studies and designs for the preparation of additional water\n            supply projects in provincial areas. While PWWA, as a\n            fledging institution, has never undertaken a project of this\n            magnitude, risks have been minimized by organizing project\n            management to take full
