Several key lessons were\n            learnt from the implementation of this pilot project in\n            terms of impact of the global market on the competitiveness\n            of silk sub-sector, institutional reforms, women's\n            entrepreneurship development, merits of pilot project and\n            institutional framework for innovative projects. Bangladesh\n            has good potential for sericulture and cocoon processing and\n            can compete in a world market where the playing field is\n            level and not dominated by China, as it is now. Sericulture\n            can provide an attractive income for the rural poor, but not\n            necessarily for those who have no access to some land, or\n            modest amount of finance (own equity or credit) needed to\n            start the operations. Sericulture as an activity depends on\n            efficient downstream processing of cocoons and weaving, and\n            will only be successful if there is vertical integration of\n            all stages of the production chain. Initiating fundamental\n            institutional reforms in a deeply entrenched bureaucratic\n            structure is difficult and time consuming and should not be\n            under-estimated at project design stage. Pilot projects, if\n            well designed and supervised project, can be very successful\n            in demonstrating new technologies and in supporting\n            politically sensitive institutional reforms--their\n            particular strength being an ability to focus on important\n            key details rather than concerns about rates of progress or\n            disbursement. Not-for-profit Foundations can provide the\n            essential support services representing the interests of a\n            range of stakeholders from small scale producers through to\n            manufactures. However, there are problems in securing\n            adequate autonomy for foundations initially supported with\n            government funds, and in attracting capable managers from\n            the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Silk Development Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Silk Development\n            Pilot Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/2850851/bangladesh-silk-development-pilot-project","projn":"BD-Silk Development Pilot Project -- P040713","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040108105653"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,Other industry,Central government administration,Animal production","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adverse impacts,Agricultural\n            extension,Animal production,benchmark,comparative\n            advantage,competition policy,Competitive\n            Bidding,competitiveness,deregulation,economic\n            analysis,economic development,economic efficiency,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economies of scale,employment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,exports,farmers,feed,financial\n            management,imports,income,incomes,living\n            standards,marketing,monopolies,NGOS,Non-Governmental\n            Organizations,policy environment,policy makers,Present\n            Value,private sector,producers,production\n            costs,productivity,programs,Rural\n            Development,scientists,Sericulture,Silk,silkworms,social\n            services,sustainable development,Technical\n            Assistance,technical constraints,Textiles,TOT,trade\n            liberalization,Training Centers,training\n            modules,universities,value added"},"1":{"cdata!":"adverse impacts,Agricultural\n            extension,Animal production,benchmark,comparative\n            advantage,competition policy,Competitive\n            Bidding,competitiveness,deregulation,economic\n            analysis,economic development,economic efficiency,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economies of scale,employment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,exports,farmers,feed,financial\n            management,imports,income,incomes,living\n            standards,marketing,monopolies,NGOS,Non-Governmental\n            Organizations,policy environment,policy makers,Present\n            Value,private sector,producers,production\n            costs,productivity,programs,Rural\n            Development,scientists,Sericulture,Silk,silkworms,social\n            services,sustainable development,Technical\n            Assistance,technical constraints,Textiles,TOT,trade\n            liberalization,Training Centers,training\n            modules,universities,value added"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029466-PHRD-SILK DEVLEOPMENT PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF029556-PHRD-SILK DEV.

The project is composed of four\n            components. The policy reform and institutional development\n            component comprises five sub-components: 1) further\n            deregulating the silk industry; restructuring the Bangladesh\n            Sericulture Board (BSB) and its Research and Training\n            Institute (BSRTI); 2) establishing the Silk Foundation (SF);\n            3) promoting associations of producers of cocoons and raw\n            silk; and 4) providing technical assistance to the Ministry\n            of Textiles (MOT). The productivity enhancement and research\n            component consists of investments aimed at improving sector\n            performance and enhancing technology. This component\n            comprises sub-components to develop research capacity to\n            improve yields, productivity, and income; to establish,\n            staff, and operate germplasm maintenance centers; to develop\n            and lease grainages (hatcheries); and to support a pilot\n            program to determine the country's potential\n            competitive advantage for producing high quality bivoltine\n            raw silk. The third component, technology dissemination,\n            develops the training capacity of BSRTI; sets up field\n            training centers for chawki rearers, silkworm rearers, and\n            reelers; funds the salaries of extension staff and provides\n            technical assistance; and disseminates information about\n            chawki rearing technology (which improves the quality of\n            eggs and the rearing process). The fourth component, product\n            development and market promotion, funds experts and training\n            to produce fashion designs for trade shows, and finances\n            project monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Silk Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Silk Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/10/693962/bangladesh-silk-development-project","projn":"BD-Silk Development Pilot Project -- P040713","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Health Economics & Finance,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912213659"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Animal production,Other industry,Agricultural extension and research,Other social services","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-1","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            research,agriculture,Annual Report,climate,comparative\n            advantage,Cost Benefit\n            Analysis,decentralization,deregulation,development\n            agencies,economic development,Economic Impact,Economic Rate\n            of Return,employment,equipment,extension,families,financial\n            management,imports,income,incomes,laws,living\n            standards,Managers,market failures,market\n            liberalization,marketing,mothers,new\n            technologies,NGOs,physical development,policy\n            environment,poverty alleviation,Present Value,private\n            sector,producers,productivity,public goods,public\n            sector,quality control,Rural\n            Development,schools,Sericulture,Silk,silk\n            industry,sustainable development,takeover,Technical\n            Assistance,Textiles,trade policies,Value Added,waste,World\n            Trade Organization,WTO"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            research,agriculture,Annual Report,climate,comparative\n            advantage,Cost Benefit\n            Analysis,decentralization,deregulation,development\n            agencies,economic development,Economic Impact,Economic Rate\n            of Return,employment,equipment,extension,families,financial\n            management,imports,income,incomes,laws,living\n            standards,Managers,market failures,market\n            liberalization,marketing,mothers,new\n            technologies,NGOs,physical development,policy\n            environment,poverty alleviation,Present Value,private\n            sector,producers,productivity,public goods,public\n            sector,quality control,Rural\n            Development,schools,Sericulture,Silk,silk\n            industry,sustainable development,takeover,Technical\n            Assistance,Textiles,trade policies,Value Added,waste,World\n            Trade Organization,WTO"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF040698-BANGLADESH: SILK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF034846-BANGLADESH - SILK DEVELOPMENT\n            PILOT PROJECT,TF033705-BANGLADESH - AGRICULTURE,TF029556-PHRD-SILK DEV.
