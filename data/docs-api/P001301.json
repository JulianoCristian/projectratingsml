The project partially\n            achieved its objectives, institutional development was only\n            partially achieved, sustainability is unlikely, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, this project clearly illustrates that full\n            public financing and public provision of education services,\n            coupled with the restriction of financial and managerial\n            autonomy, inhibits efficiency and effectiveness and\n            generates little beneficiary involvement. Second, a feasible\n            financing scheme should provide quality education in a\n            sustainable manner. Third, future education projects in\n            Kenya should focus tightly on following specific\n            requirements, such as contributing to the Government's\n            development of a coherent sector policy framework with a\n            specified action plan during project preparation. Finally,\n            future projects should deploy firm, consistent measures to\n            prevent chronic problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Sixth Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya -
