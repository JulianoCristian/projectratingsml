Lessons learned: Pilot projects offer\n            feasible opportunities for developing instruments and\n            testing models. The timing of a health project that seeks to\n            test reform elements is particularly sensible, and not\n            always perfectly manageable. Incentives remain a critical\n            variable in order to guarantee results. Performance\n            evaluations are critical, even more in learning efforts.\n            Consensus building is critical, but requires proper\n            instruments with the correct timing. Human resources and\n            labor-related issues remain a major bottleneck for health\n            sector reform and can not be underestimated.

The project consists of four\n            components. The first component will implement the piloting\n            of a new model for providing, organizing, and financing\n            health services in San Miguelito Health Region. The second\n            component will initiate the strengthening of the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH) central level in the areas of policy making,\n            regulation, and financing in order to support the pilot. It\n            will also implement the corporate agreement between the MOH\n            and Social Security Institute in key strategic areas. The\n            third component will carry out studies, pilots, technical\n            assistance, and training activities to scale up the reform\n            to other health regions. It will also facilitate the\n            constitution of health reform teams in other health regions\n            together with the adaptations of the San Miguelito pilot to\n            local conditions.
