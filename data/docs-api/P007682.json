The project has three components.\n            The principal component is technology generation through\n            research.  Research areas include: crop improvement,\n            livestock management, forestry and natural resources.  The\n            second component is technology transfer through extension.\n            Activities include on-farm trials to validate promising\n            technologies, staff training, and soil conservation.  The\n            last component involves institutional development of the\n            National Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock\n            Research (INIFAP).  This component will improve the\n            institutional capacity of INIFAP, assist in mobilizing\n            resources via cost recovery, promote work on environmental\n            and sector

livestock, and forestry production; b)\n            validate technology using adaptive research in collaboration\n            with the extension service; c) transfer technologies to\n            producers via extension; d) improve the capacity of public\n            institutions to generate and extend new technologies by\n            strengthening their ability to identify problems, manage\n            scientific problems and use research results from external\n            sources; and e) establish improvement in funding for\n            agricultural research.  The project has three components.\n            The principal component is technology generation through\n            research.  Research areas include: crop improvement,\n            livestock management, forestry and natural resources.  The\n            second component is technology transfer through extension.\n            Activities include on-farm trials to validate promising\n            technologies, staff training, and soil conservation.  The\n            last component involves institutional development of the\n            National Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock\n            Research (INIFAP).  This component will improve the\n            institutional capacity of INIFAP, assist in mobilizing\n            resources via cost recovery, promote work on environmental\n            and sector productivity issues, and broaden the intellectual\n            base of agricultural research."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Agricultural Technology Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Agricultural Technology Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/04/736906/mexico-agricultural-technology-project","projn":"MX-Agr.Technology -- P007682","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Scientific Research & Science Parks,ICT Policy and Strategies,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961001171753"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adaptive research,Agribusiness,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural research,agricultural\n            technologies,Agricultural Technology,Agriculture,annual\n            report,audits,basic research,beans,beef,Capital\n            Markets,CITIES,collaboration,collaborative\n            research,commodities,Consumer\n            Goods,Crops,Drainage,environmental benefits,environmental\n            costs,equipment,extension services,Food\n            Processing,Forestry,Forestry Research,fruits,genetic\n            resources,Health Care,Housing,information needs,information\n            services,information systems,integrated pest\n            management,investment in agricultural\n            research,Iron,Irrigation,Laboratories,Laboratory\n            equipment,Libraries,Livestock,Livestock\n            Research,maize,managers,Marketing,new\n            technologies,pesticides,private sector,programs,public\n            agricultural research,public sector,public services,Research\n            Grants,Research Laboratories,research management,research\n            networks,rice,rural development,safety,scientific\n            information,scientists,Sodium,soil conservation,technical\n            assistance,techniques,technology\n            transfer,Telecommunications,Textiles,tropical\n            agriculture,universities,vegetables,Waste,Water Resources,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"adaptive research,Agribusiness,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural research,agricultural\n            technologies,Agricultural Technology,Agriculture,annual\n            report,audits,basic research,beans,beef,Capital\n            Markets,CITIES,collaboration,collaborative\n            research,commodities,Consumer\n            Goods,Crops,Drainage,environmental benefits,environmental\n            costs,equipment,extension services,Food\n            Processing,Forestry,Forestry Research,fruits,genetic\n            resources,Health Care,Housing,information needs,information\n            services,information systems,integrated pest\n            management,investment in agricultural\n            research,Iron,Irrigation,Laboratories,Laboratory\n            equipment,Libraries,Livestock,Livestock\n            Research,maize,managers,Marketing,new\n            technologies,pesticides,private sector,programs,public\n            agricultural research,public sector,public services,Research\n            Grants,Research Laboratories,research management,research\n            networks,rice,rural development,safety,scientific\n            information,scientists,Sodium,soil conservation,technical\n            assistance,techniques,technology\n            transfer,Telecommunications,Textiles,tropical\n            agriculture,universities,vegetables,Waste,Water Resources,wheat"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"P5601"},"facets":{}}}
