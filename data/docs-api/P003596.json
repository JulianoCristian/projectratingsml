Lessons are as\n            follows. Irrigation projects, and irrigation management\n            reforms, based on water supply committees (WSC), and\n            farmer's water users associations (WUA), integrated\n            into the project as a component, provide large benefits,\n            including to poor and vulnerable groups. These benefits were\n            demonstrated by the rates of return at completion of\n            irrigation subprojects, which were all above appraisal\n            estimates, and roughly correlated with the degree of WSC,\n            particularly WUA development. Nevertheless, a clear focus is\n            required for the main objective - either water resources\n            development and management, or, agricultural productivity\n            improvement (the former objective is appropriate to a water\n            resources project, the latter to a comprehensive\n            agricultural development project). In the provision of\n            agricultural support to irrigation, it may be more\n            effectively implemented at lower levels, even by\n            beneficiaries, contracting for the services most required.\n            Related to the above, more focused and simplified project\n            design, i.e., single agency management control would be\n            possible, and more efficient. In addition, multiple\n            provinces should not be combined under a single\n            Bank-financed project when the components in the provinces\n            are widely different, and when there is no central agency to\n            coordinate them. There are no economies of scale under such\n            circumstances, thus placing a heavy burden on the Bank to\n            provide adequate preparation, supervision and coordination;\n            instead, a better configuration may have been a separate\n            general agricultural development project in Hubei, and a\n            water resources project in Hunan, with better results in\n            both cases. Most importantly, reduced Bank supervision can\n            affect project outcomes, and quality at completion,\n            particularly for complex, and/or innovative projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Yangtze Basin Water Resources Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Yangtze Basin Water\n            Resources Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2408117/china-yangtze-basin-water-resources-project","projn":"CN-Yangtze Basin Water Resources Project -- P003596","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water Law","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20030702134750"},"subsc":"Animal production,Renewable energy,Irrigation and drainage,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Flood protection","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Energy and mining,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,aquaculture,aqueducts,canals,capacity\n            building,central government,Competitive\n            Bidding,construction,cost recovery,counterpart funding,dam\n            height,Dam\n            Safety,dams,dike,discharge,ditches,diversion,Drainage,drainage\n            operations,dredging,drought,efficient water\n            use,embankments,farmers,fertilizers,fishing,Flood\n            Control,flood damage,flood damage reduction,Flood\n            Forecasting,flood management,Flood\n            protection,flooding,floods,forestry,grazing,households,imports,investment\n            costs,Irrigation,Irrigation District,Irrigation\n            Management,irrigation systems,irrigation water,Lakes,large\n            dams,limestone,local communities,local water,local water\n            management,municipal\n            water,municipalities,Nitrogen,Phosphate,ponds,programs,provincial\n            Government,Provincial Water,pump station,pumping,pumping\n            station,pumping stations,pumps,rainfall,reservoirs,river\n            basin,river basin management,rivers,seepage,service\n            area,storage capacity,town,waste of money,water\n            development,water management,water pollution,Water\n            resource,Water resource management,Water Resources,water\n            resources development,water sector,Water Supply,water\n            use,Water User,Water User Association,watershed,weirs"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,aquaculture,aqueducts,canals,capacity\n            building,central government,Competitive\n            Bidding,construction,cost recovery,counterpart funding,dam\n            height,Dam\n            Safety,dams,dike,discharge,ditches,diversion,Drainage,drainage\n            operations,dredging,drought,efficient water\n            use,embankments,farmers,fertilizers,fishing,Flood\n            Control,flood damage,flood damage reduction,Flood\n            Forecasting,flood management,Flood\n            protection,flooding,floods,forestry,grazing,households,imports,investment\n            costs,Irrigation,Irrigation District,Irrigation\n            Management,irrigation systems,irrigation water,Lakes,large\n            dams,limestone,local communities,local water,local water\n            management,municipal\n            water,municipalities,Nitrogen,Phosphate,ponds,programs,provincial\n            Government,Provincial Water,pump station,pumping,pumping\n            station,pumping stations,pumps,rainfall,reservoirs,river\n            basin,river basin management,rivers,seepage,service\n            area,storage capacity,town,waste of money,water\n            development,water management,water pollution,Water\n            resource,Water resource management,Water Resources,water\n            resources development,water sector,Water Supply,water\n            use,Water User,Water User Association,watershed,weirs"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022100-ITALIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF022764-PHRD-YANGTZE BASIN WATER RES./RECIPIENT,TF022786-PHRD-YANGTZE BASIN WATER RESOURCES/BANK,TF025564-PHRD-IRRIGATED AGRIC.\n            INTENSIFICATION PROJ.
