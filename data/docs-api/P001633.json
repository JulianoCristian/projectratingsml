Some lessons learned included:  there\n            is not only a need for new school construction, but for\n            improvement and maintenance of the existing ones. Provision\n            of furniture and textbooks should not only be limited to the\n            new schools, but the requirements of nearby schools for\n            these inputs should also be assessed. This will alleviate\n            the unevenness in quality of learning that will otherwise\n            transpire. Moreover, there is a need for International\n            Development Association (IDA) to balance its physical\n            infrastructure component with the requirement for\n            instructional inputs such as learning/teaching materials and\n            for training and capacity building in future projects. All\n            these inputs are required for 'effective' learning\n            to take place. The use of small local contractors for civil\n            works for mostly small primary schools was a major problem.\n            The borrower has also indicated in its assessment that this\n            arrangement caused significant delay and implementation\n            difficulties for the project. Most of the contractors did\n            not have adequate experience with such type of contracts;\n            were ill equipped; lacked adequate working capital, and were\n            a very risky group to advance any payments to. Many of them\n            were absentee contractors who rarely visited the sites, thus\n            exacerbating the situation. The lesson derived from this is\n            that proper selection for pre-qualification of potential\n            contractors should be carried out to ascertain the financial\n            and implementation capacity of these contractors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - First Education Sector Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - First Education Sector
