Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: in post-conflict settings engagement is a\n            means to an end and needs to be accompanied by a sustained\n            policy dialogue to ensure that development gains are\n            realized in the medium term. In the area of HIV/AIDS a\n            demand-driven model of community sub-projects is more\n            appropriate for service delivery interventions that are\n            responsive to local community needs (such as home-based\n            care, support to orphans and vulnerable children) than for\n            preventive interventions targeting stigmatized risk groups\n            or stigmatized behavior. Community activities that are\n            strategically planned and coordinated with the local health\n            authorities can provide an important complement to health\n            facility-based disease control efforts. Disease control\n            projects can be complementary to and need not undermine\n            cross-cutting health system functions. Multi-sector\n            projects, such as HIV/AIDS projects, achieve better results\n            if the sectors involved are strategically chosen according\n            to their comparative

The lessons learned included the following:\n            (1) HAMSET provides several important lessons regarding the\n            Bank's Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) projects. The\n            lessons are particularly important since HAMSET is one of\n            the first MAP projects that has closed and been immediately\n            followed by a second one. In addition, HAMSET design, with\n            its multi-disease approach, was different from most MAP\n            projects which focus only on HIV/AIDS. The lessons, varying\n            from stewardship of MAP projects to their sustainability,\n            have relevance beyond Eritrea to other countries. The\n            lessons learned included the following: (1) Project design\n            should be flexible and tailored for the country; (2)\n            Mobilizing communities and relevant sectors are keys; (3)\n            Effectively integrate activities of vertical disease\n            programs, reproductive health and support health systems;\n            (4) Clarify policy on the use of DDT as the environmental\n            aspect of Malaria control has been complicated by the mixed\n            messages over the use of DDT among international\n            organizations and governments; (5) Build local capacity for\n            planning and budgeting; (6) Procurement can be facilitated\n            by innovative thinking; (7) Give monitoring and evaluation\n            higher priority in design and prepare early for collection\n            of data for analysis of cost effectiveness; (8) Address the\n            discordance between knowledge, attitude and practice on\n            HAMSET diseases; (9) Address the challenges of\n            sustainability, starting with integration and community\n            ownership; (10) Address the shortage of human resources for\n            health; and (11) The report-based disbursement system (which\n            was adopted in the second half of the project) allowed more\n            predictable cash flow, more flexibility and

malaria control program in Eritrea,\n            that might possibly have adverse environmental side-effects,\n            unless properly planned, and managed. The continued use of\n            the insecticide DDT is a major concern, and this evaluation\n            finds that, consistent with the World Health\n            Organization's guidelines, its use is effective, when\n            used in high risk areas to prevent epidemic conditions.\n            However, plans to phase out DDT should be developed, and\n            alternate replacement insecticides tested. Recommendations,\n            and mitigating measures include: 1) annual testing - for a\n            period of five years - of the susceptibility of vectors in\n            the field of DDT. In addition, pyrethroids, and other\n            formulations, should be tested to select the most suitable,\n            based on efficacy, safety, and economic value, and be\n            pilot-tested against DDT during the third to fifth year,\n            when DDT should begin phasing-out; 2) capacity building, and\n            strengthening the infrastructure of the National Malaria\n            Control Program, focusing on entomology training, and\n            collection of baseline biological data, to support\n            monitoring of vector control components; 3) develop a\n            strategy for community-based implementation, and maintenance\n            of insecticide impregnated bed nets; and, 4) improve the\n            collection, and analysis of data leading to\n            cost-effectiveness information on different methods of\n            malaria vector control."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental analysis and executive summary"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Eritrea -
