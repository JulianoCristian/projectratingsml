The macroeconomic context is that of\n            Brazil and Bahia. Brazil's economy experienced large\n            swings in the last three decades, with high growth rates\n            until the mid-I 970s, deteriorating conditions reaching\n            negative growth rates in the early 1980s, and growth\n            resuming thereafter. Bahia, one of Brazil Northeastern\n            states, still relies heavily on agriculture, which\n            represents some 20 percent of the state's gross\n            domestic product. In 1976, in support of Brazil's rural\n            development strategy, the Bank shifted its lending for\n            highways from trunk roads to feeder roads, that is, roads\n            connecting agricultural production areas with villages and\n            produce markets. This study deals with two such projects in\n            the State of Bahia, approved in 1976 and 1979. These\n            projects financed the improvement of some 1,500 kilometers\n            of roads, distributed over 63 road sites. A major\n            shortcoming of the two projects was the absence of a\n            monitoring and evaluation system. This made the evaluation\n            of the impact of the two projects especially difficult,\n            particularly in light of the substantial changes in economic\n            conditions at different times through the projects lives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
