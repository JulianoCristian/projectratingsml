Some lessons learned\n            included: the first lesson relates to the importance of the\n            timing and the right sequence in sector reform efforts.\n            Though the project operation by itself focused originally\n            (and correctly) on public enterprise reform of the\n            vertically integrated utility of a modest sized power system\n            and its commercialization, the reform agenda changed later,\n            under the Consolidated Structural Adjustment Credit (CSAC)\n            operation, to one focusing on sector unbundling, possible\n            privatization of distribution entities, and introduction of\n            possible competitive trading mechanisms. The second lesson\n            relates to the need for better coordination between the\n            World Bank operations and those of International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) to avoid the Bank financed projects being stalled\n            as a result of IMF conditionality's relating to public\n            investment programs.
