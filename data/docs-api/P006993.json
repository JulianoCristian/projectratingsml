There were no disbursements under\n            the loan except for the front-end fee. A Bank supervision\n            mission in November 1983 detected a basic loss of commitment\n            on the part of the Central Government toward the strict\n            financial measures required at the local level. Without\n            those measures, attainment of project objectives was\n            jeopardized. In January 1984, the Government confirmed the\n            municipality's inability to provide counterpart funds.\n            In February 1984, the municipality requested that the loan\n            be cancelled for macroeconomic reasons. Although the Bank\n            did not discount the country's difficult macroeconomic\n            situation, it felt that political considerations were more\n            to blame for the project's demise. The project called\n            for a disciplined approach to municipal management. The loan\n            agreement contained covenants requiring stricter enforcement\n            of land tax and other financial and accounting measures.\n            Also, the project supported a reduction in the city's\n            blue collar workforce. The Bank concluded that the project\n            was too politically sensitive to be implemented. As a result\n            of cancellation, the project's institutional impact was\n            nil and there were no benefits to be sustained. The overall\n            project rating is unsatisfactory. No audit is planned. The\n            Bank's experience with this project illustrates the\n            pitfalls of attempting to deal with a Government\n            characterized by highly centralized decision making, lack of\n            clear economic policy, uncertain commitment to reform, and\n            weak institutional capacity. The Bank has learned to move\n            cautiously in the Dominican Republic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Santo Domingo\n            Municipality Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominican Republic - Santo\n            Domingo Municipality Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/734513/dominican-republic-santo-domingo-municipality-technical-assistance-project","projn":"DO-Santo Domingo Ta -- P006993","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,National Governance,Public Sector Management and Reform,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Governance,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Dominican Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925173810"},"subsc":"(Historic)Public sector management adjustment","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Governance,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,authorization,Borrower,borrowing,central\n            government,commitment,counterpart,counterpart funds,current\n            expenditures,decision making,disbursements,economic\n            recovery,financial autonomy,FISCAL,fiscal crises,fiscal\n            problems,FISCAL YEAR,IDA credit,institutional\n            capacity,institutional development,institutional\n            structure,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreement,local level,local\n            taxes,macroeconomic conditions,municipal\n            government,municipal management,Municipality,public\n            sector,solid waste disposal,solid waste\n            management,tax,taxation,Technical Assistance,traffic\n            management,urban management,urban planning,urban\n            services,user charges"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,authorization,Borrower,borrowing,central\n            government,commitment,counterpart,counterpart funds,current\n            expenditures,decision making,disbursements,economic\n            recovery,financial autonomy,FISCAL,fiscal crises,fiscal\n            problems,FISCAL YEAR,IDA credit,institutional\n            capacity,institutional development,institutional\n            structure,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreement,local level,local\n            taxes,macroeconomic conditions,municipal\n            government,municipal management,Municipality,public\n            sector,solid waste disposal,solid waste\n            management,tax,taxation,Technical Assistance,traffic\n            management,urban management,urban planning,urban\n            services,user charges"}},"owner":"Caribbean Countries CMU (LCC3C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"12091"},"722975":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/05/722975/dominican-republic-santo-domingo-municipality-technical-assistance-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/05/722975/dominican-republic-santo-domingo-municipality-technical-assistance-project","new_url":"1983/05/722975/dominican-republic-santo-domingo-municipality-technical-assistance-project","disclosure_date":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"0015-07-04T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"0015-07-04T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/21/000178830_98101902413981/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/21/000178830_98101902413981/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2292","datestored":"2000-03-21T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1983-05-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Santo Domingo\n            Municipality Technical Assistance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The proposed project would help the\n            Municipality of Santo Domingo in handling complex issues of\n            city management, planning and development arising from rapid\n            growth.
