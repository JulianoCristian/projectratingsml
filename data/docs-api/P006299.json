The macroeconomic context is that of\n            Brazil and Bahia. Brazil's economy experienced large\n            swings in the last three decades, with high growth rates\n            until the mid-I 970s, deteriorating conditions reaching\n            negative growth rates in the early 1980s, and growth\n            resuming thereafter. Bahia, one of Brazil Northeastern\n            states, still relies heavily on agriculture, which\n            represents some 20 percent of the state's gross\n            domestic product. In 1976, in support of Brazil's rural\n            development strategy, the Bank shifted its lending for\n            highways from trunk roads to feeder roads, that is, roads\n            connecting agricultural production areas with villages and\n            produce markets. This study deals with two such projects in\n            the State of Bahia, approved in 1976 and 1979. These\n            projects financed the improvement of some 1,500 kilometers\n            of roads, distributed over 63 road sites. A major\n            shortcoming of the two projects was the absence of a\n            monitoring and evaluation system. This made the evaluation\n            of the impact of the two projects especially difficult,\n            particularly in light of the substantial changes in economic\n            conditions at different times through the projects lives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

Three groups of states have been designated to\n            make it easier for lower income states to participate in the\n            project. The low-income states will contribute only 20% of\n            project costs; middle-income states will contribute 30%, and\n            the comparatively high-income state of Sao Paulo will\n            contribute 40% of project costs.

and improvement of rural\n            feeder roads. Three groups of states have been designated to\n            make it easier for lower income states to participate in the\n            project. The low-income states will contribute only 20% of\n            project costs; middle-income states will contribute 30%, and\n            the comparatively high-income state of Sao Paulo will\n            contribute 40% of project costs. The Bank's\n            contribution of US$110 million or 32.5% of total project\n            costs (equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange cost),\n            will match the contribution of the National Economic\n            Development Bank (BNDE). The National Highway Department\n            (DNER) will contribute 8.9% of project costs. The risks\n            involved in the project are minimal since it is a\n            continuation of a program being financed by Loan 1207-BR,\n            commitments under which are well advanced. The new\n            administration, which took office on March 15, 1979, has\n            indicated that agricultural development will be given high\n            priority, and past experience has shown that the Brazilian\n            Government gives effective support to programs which it\n            considers to be of importance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Feeder Roads
