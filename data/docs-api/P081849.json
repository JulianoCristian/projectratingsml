Some lessons learned included: this project\n            was relatively small from an investment perspective, but it\n            was very opportunistic and focused as it was specifically\n            designed to take advantage of the high-level political will\n            to undertake telecom sector reforms, and to support the\n            newly-established regulatory agency which needed significant\n            strengthening. The initial delays and risks to project\n            outcomes could be reasonably attributed to the lack of\n            sufficient resources at the implementing agencies when the\n            project started. Hence, the credit could have required the\n            Government to allocate sufficient staff resources at the\n            implementing agencies, and the project design should have\n            provisioned for full-time and incentivized staff for\n            implementation. Ministry of Post and Telecommunications\n            (MOPT) also tried to address this issue during\n            implementation by submitting an amended Technical Assistance\n            Project Proforma (TAPP) for additional resources and having\n            its staff trained under the project. The project seized the\n            opportunity of high-level political will to restructure\n            Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB), but\n            encountered an unexpectedly high level of resistance from\n            BTTB's management and labor unions. Hence, the use of\n            methodological approaches such as political economy and/or\n            stakeholder analysis could have provided more realistic\n            contextual basis for future projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Telecommunications Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Telecommunications\n            Technical

       through strengthening elements of the policy, institutional,\n            and regulatory framework in order to promote the competitive\n            provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services.\n            There are two main project components. The main objective of\n            the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MOPT) component\n            is to separate the policy and operational roles of the\n            Government. This will be achieved through 1) restructuring\n            the Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board (BTTB); and 2)\n            strengthening the policy function in MOPT. Technical\n            assistance will be provided to implement BTTB restructuring\n            and convert it from the present Government board into a\n            company, registered under the Company's Act. Support\n            will be provided to carry out a number of activities\n            including: a) re-examining Ordinance XII of 1979 (amended in\n            1995) that established BTTB; b)asset/liability allocation;\n            c) Financial audit and creation of opening financial\n            statements; d) a cost-based tariff study; e) Examining\n            options for rationalization of labor force; f) public\n            relations; g) development of a business plan; and h)\n            development of a performance contract for BTTB. Technical\n            assistance support for consultancy and training programs\n            will be provided in order to strengthen MOPT's capacity\n            to carryout its policy functions. This will include a)\n            policy review and formulation; establishment of processes\n            and procedures for policy monitoring and evaluation; and\n            re-examination of Bangladesh's WTO commitments and\n            preparation of a new telecommunications offer; b)\n            development of a universal access strategy; c) other studies\n            on policy issues such as convergence, market structure,\n            competition; d) capacity building and professional\n            development through in-country, on the job and external\n            training programs;
