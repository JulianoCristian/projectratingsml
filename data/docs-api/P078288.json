Some lessons learned included:  the creation\n            of a favorable environment was conducive to the political\n            and national reconciliation success. Contributing to this\n            success was: the adoption of an amnesty law, the\n            program's strong emphasis on community participation\n            (civil society, churches), the involvement of various\n            sectors and institutions in the demobilization process, the\n            continued dialogue with the former belligerent groups, large\n            sensitization campaigns, the promotion of citizenship\n            principles, and the promotion of a permanent involvement of\n            National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  (UNITA)\n            into the full Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration\n            (DDR) process. The experience of the project highlighted the\n            importance of locally defining each reintegration support\n            intervention, starting from the local context, the demand of\n            services and the profile of the target group, stimulating\n            the permanence of ex-militaries in rural areas, and\n            reinforcing the skills at various endogenous and exogenous\n            knowledge levels. A strong and permanent involvement of the\n            local authorities also proved valuable for the project.\n            Local authorities were key players into the reintegration\n            process and were widely involved in the Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) of ex-militaries' reintegration\n            support. The involvement of local authorities represented an\n            efficient and permanent follow-up of reintegration support\n            and facilitated the reconciliation and the promotion of\n            peace at the community level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - Emergency Demobilization and\n            Reintegration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Angola - Emergency

be\n            to help consolidate economic stability in the country, and\n            in the greater Great Lakes region. The program will focus on\n            demobilization of ex-combatants, and help support their\n            return into civilian life, and, facilitate the reallocation\n            of Government expenditure from military, to social and\n            economic sectors. It is expected the project will have a\n            significant impact on poverty reduction, by establishing\n            more secure conditions in rural areas, thus encouraging the\n            resumption of productive lives in the rural economy, and,\n            will further free additional national resources for\n            investment in social, and economic sectors. Additionally,\n            investments in human capital development of ex-combatants,\n            will further enhance the implementation capacity of\n            community-based development organizations. The main\n            components include demobilization through specific modules,\n            based on an identification card system, a program benefit\n            card, and socioeconomic profiling, to provide transitional\n            assistance in cash, or in-kind; reintegration, through the\n            provision of counseling, and information for potential job\n            opportunities, and assistance in securing employment, as\n            well as educational, or skills improvements within\n            vulnerable groups; and, institutional, and program\n            development, supervised through a program coordinator at\n            high Government levels, but whose implementation shall be\n            the responsibility of a single civilian agency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola -
