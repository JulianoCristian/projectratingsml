The main lessons from these credits are: 1)\n            Small, focused, one-tranche policy projects with realistic\n            objectives, supported by technical assistance, may work well\n            in transition countries that are politically unstable and\n            have low market economy skills. A limited reform agenda is\n            easier to implement, especially if parliamentary approval is\n            needed for new laws when the political landscape is not\n            stable. Reform continuity can be maintained by similar\n            policy or investment follow-on projects. 2) The very quick\n            preparation and disbursement o f PESC was effective in\n            providing development assistance and coordinating\n            substantial humanitarian assistance. 3) Disbursement against\n            a negative list of imports expedited resource transfer,\n            which was appropriate in Albania's circumstances. 4)\n            Aid coordination--including the appropriate alignment o f\n            government agencies--is critical to ensure appropriate,\n            harmonized and effective assistance where many donors are\n            involved. 5) Some organizations established for special\n            purposes under IDA projects could be transformed into\n            private sector commercial entities when their mandate is\n            complete. This transition could be an integral part o f that\n            organization's strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit, Recovery\n            Program Technical Assistance

Major lessons indicate that: 1) a reform\n            program can be greatly enhanced, when the strategy is to\n            combine the project, with follow-up investment operations,\n            as well as reducing sustainability risks; 2) an\n            inter-ministerial committee, with support from the Prime\n            Minister, can become a beneficial tool vs. resistance to\n            reform; in this case, the Committee, with ministerial\n            intervention, implemented key civil service recruitments,\n            confirming that the Government actually was willing to\n            enforce the new merit-based civil service law; 3) adjustment\n            operations do not need to be all encompassing, free-standing\n            operations, rather a structural adjustment operation should\n            be seen as an integral element of a broader reform agenda;\n            4) a major thrust of the project was strengthening\n            institutional capacity, and management of public resources,\n            a detailed work program which may set realistic objectives\n            to motivate, and stimulate professional viewpoints on\n            economic policy, and public sector reform within the\n            Government; 5) launching an adjustment operation, in spite\n            of crisis conditions, can help preserve a reform agenda, for\n            the project provided highly visible support, and increased\n            the Bank's credibility, regardless of adverse\n            circumstances due to the Kosovo crisis; and, 6) donor\n

private sector development. Governance and\n            institutional reform will be the backbone of the reform\n            program. The project will aid fiscal adjustment and ensure\n            the sustainability of the reform process by strengthening\n            the institutional infrastructure needed to improve the\n            public sector's capacity to carry out its role\n            effectively and efficiently. It will also encourage private\n            sector development and improve the efficiency and\n            functioning of the banking system. By reducing public sector\n            recourse to the banking system, the SAC will allow more\n            resources for private sector investment. The project will\n            also provide a positive signal to international institutions\n            and investors regarding the government's commitment to\n            reform. The project risks include: 1) excessive pressure on\n            economy and macroeconomic stability as a result of continued\n            influx of refugees into Albania; 2) high inflation as a\n            result of macroeconomic instability; 3) potential civil\n            disorders because of political instability; and 4) program\n            implementation delay because of poor coordination
