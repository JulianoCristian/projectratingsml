This project\n            relied on the private sector and nongovernmental\n            organizations for executing project activities that reduced\n            the burden on the PCU. Hiring a single lead contractor,\n            charged with hiring and supervising the necessary experts\n            for the job to be done, can bring about the desired outcome.\n            It is necessary to include both investment and operating\n            costs in business plans, which provides a fuller picture of\n            resources needed to finance proposals prepared by\n            beneficiaries. In addition to demonstration, dissemination,\n            and adoption of innovative technologies, projects with\n            support to value chains should include an incentive\n            mechanism, preferably with grant or technical assistance to\n            encourage developers to acquire and adapt innovative\n            technologies and techniques promoted by the project. This\n            project promoted appropriate technologies but these projects\n            were adopted because of the grant mechanism the project\n            provided. The dividend from reducing post-harvest loss,\n            improvement in conservation, processing and packaging is\n            very substantial that sufficient resources should be\n            allocated early in project design. A corollary point to this\n            is that projects should actively promote to the private\n            sector the need for investing in these areas that have a\n            huge return."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Agriculture Competitiveness and\n            Diversification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Agriculture\n            Competitiveness and

the performance of value chains for a range\n            of agricultural and livestock products for which Mali has\n            strong comparative advantage. The Additional Financing (AF)\n            will help finance the costs associated with the scaling up\n            of ACDP activities, with a view to securing a higher level\n            of Development Objective (DO) achievements over an\n            additional two-year project implementation period. The AF\n            will enhance the project impact by expanding its coverage to\n            a larger group of emerging market oriented to very small\n            enterprises and Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in\n            project-targeted agriculture and livestock Value Chains\n            (V/Cs). The AF focus will be on: 1) the Innovation and\n            Investment Fund (IIF), a recipient operated financial credit\n            line which, by extending additional matching grants for\n            investment subprojects, will serve to disseminate\n            innovations already demonstrated by the project; 2)\n            continued building and strengthening of V/C\n            Inter-Professional Organizations (IPOs); 3) facilitation of\n            access to funding by the very small enterprises and SMEs\n            supported by the project; and 4) completion and expansion

Competitiveness and\n            Diversification Project aim at fostering improvements in the\n            performances of supply chains for a range of agricultural\n            and livestock products, for which Mali have strong\n            comparative advantage. The changes relate to a level two\n            restructuring of the project that entails: (i) a six month\n            extension of the project closing date from December 31, 2012\n            to June 30, 2013 to ensure both the adequate absorption of\n            the implementation delays related to the suspension period\n            and the effective coverage of the ongoing operational\n            activities up to the effectiveness of the additional\n            financing under preparation. During the suspension period\n            Government of Mali (GoM) took concrete actions, including\n            funding arrangements to secure the smooth continuation of\n            the implementation activities. Therefore, the project\n            continued to perform well, i.e. the construction program of\n            the market oriented infrastructure which is critically\n            important for the likely achievement of the project overall\n            performance and its developmental outcomes, has been\n            partially funded and is under implementation; (ii) a limited\n            and slight reallocation of the credit proceeds to align\n            project allocation of funds with the projected paths of\n            activities and ensure that the desired outcomes will remain\n            likely to be achieved. An effective enhancement of\n            project's outcomes will be targeted through a\n            well-balanced transfer of funds between categories to\n            adequately cover those more in need of supplemental funds.\n            The underlying rationale is that, during the extension\n            period, the whole process will be fully funded from the\n            available resources only, i.e. through: (a) the use of\n            available GoM resources such as those of the guarantee funds\n            and/or potential new GoM resources allocations; (b) any\n            possible cost reductions as made possible by the evolving\n            project context; and (c) a to be made, available retroactive\n            financing under the upcoming additional financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Agriculture\n            Competitiveness and Diversification Project : restructuring\n            (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/11/17035974/mali-agriculture-competitiveness-diversification-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"ML-Agricultural Competitiveness And\n            Diversification Project -- P081704","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,E-Business,Housing & Human Habitats,Labor Policies,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Mali","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20121204230713"},"theme":"Export development and competitiveness,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural markets,Other Private Sector Development","subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways,General public administration sector,General finance sector,Crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, commercial agriculture,\n            competitiveness, crops, Financing Plan, household incomes,\n            ID, Implementing Agency, incomes, institutional capacities,\n            livestock, livestock products, performances, productivity,\n            rural household, rural households, Safeguard Policies,\n            subsistence, supply chains"}},"owner":"Agric., RD & Irrigt'n Prac 1 (AFTA1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF052106-PHRD-MALI: AGRICULTURAL\n            COMPETITIVENESS AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT,TF052804-PHRD-MALI: AGRICULTURAL\n            COMPETITIVENESS AND DIVERSIFICATION,TF090855-SMALLHOLDER TREECROP PLANTATION PROJECT,TF099454-Improving the quality of dried\n            mango products in Mali and Burkina Faso","majtheme":"Rural development,Trade and integration,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"74157"},"facets":{}}}
