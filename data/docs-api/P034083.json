The project had a discontinued and\n            truncated life. Within six months of the loan effectiveness,\n            the entire Bank program for Turkmenistan - including the\n            project - was suspended for about a year, due to procurement\n            irregularities under another Bank operation. The suspension\n            was lifted in May 1999. In February 2001, the Government\n            requested the Bank to stop the project and cancel the\n            remaining balance. The most important lesson from this\n            project is that the scope and depth of institutional and\n            policy changes have to be well linked to the political\n            environment in which it is to be implemented. Secondly, the\n            Bank may have erred in estimating the Borrower's\n            commitment and surely erred in estimating its capacity for\n            change in this project. Thirdly, the Loan/Project Agreements\n            only, not the Project Appraisal Document, should define the\n            contractual obligations undertaken by the Borrower.\n            Fourthly, there was resistance to studies and direct\n            technical assistance from external consultants. Fifthly, the\n            quality control process may be too quick and too concerned\n            with numerical ratings. Finally, the project lacked a\n            financial evaluation for major vehicle purchases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkmenistan - Urban Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkmenistan -
