The Bank provided an\n            important role in this project. Experience gained and main\n            lessons learned from the projects are the following: the two\n            projects demonstrated the difficulty of implementing\n            development projects in a volatile political, and economic\n            environment, and the need for the Bank to take strong action\n            if ill-advised policies threaten to undermine project\n            benefits. The complex and eventful history of the project\n            shows the risk of trying to implement a project when the\n            Bank and the Borrower are not able to reach a clear\n            understanding on project objectives and components. Finally,\n            Bank support for the project was kept alive principally for\n            the sake of maintaining good relations between the\n            Government and the Bank. It is believed that a stronger\n            stance when covenants were breached, and possibly\n            International Development Association (IDA) withdrawal from\n            the project, might have proved more effective in moving the\n            Government to take stronger and more effective action."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rapport d'evaluation
