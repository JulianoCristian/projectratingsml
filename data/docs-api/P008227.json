The dominance of the\n            project in the health sector, mainly because of the\n            magnitude of its investments relative to the implementing\n            agencies' budgets, led to an absence of incentives in\n            seeking efficient endemic disease controls; for its value,\n            based on funding public health programs, did not improve\n            resources management. Interestingly, only by the end of the\n            project, did the Ministry of Health achieve some savings, by\n            limiting the use of per diem, or travel expenses, to instead\n            integrate disease control activities into the regular work,\n            successfully increasing community participation. Neither was\n            evaluation stimulated, which despite not being included in\n            the design, little motivation existed for monitoring and\n            evaluation. Thus, the lack of attention to performance\n            indicators, and evaluation hindered institutional\n            strengthening, whereas the Bank could have promoted\n            meaningful evaluation, had resource allocation been\n            contingent to impact indicators. Moreover, the lack of\n            gradual shifts in recurrent costs to the national\n            counterpart funds, led to missed opportunities in enhancing\n            sustainability of endemic disease control activities.\n            Finally, the introduction of international competitive\n            bidding processes provided far lower prices, which may well\n            sustain purchases of pesticides, drugs, or high cost\n            consumables, as opposed to prior costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Venezuela -
