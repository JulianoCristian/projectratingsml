The sustainability of the project is\n            rated as likely. The long-term sustainability of the program\n            requires that municipalities acquire institutional,\n            technical, and financial capacity to thoroughly assume such\n            responsibility, given their jurisdiction and responsibility\n            over the rural road network. The overall performance of the\n            World Bank is rated as highly satisfactory. The\n            Borrower's overall performance is assessed as\n            satisfactory to highly satisfactory. The implementation of\n            this project was particularly rich in testing innovative\n            approaches to communicating with rural communities and\n            measuring outcomes in order to better understand the links\n            between rural accessibility improvements and poverty.
