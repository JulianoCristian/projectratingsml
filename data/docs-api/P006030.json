The economic recession experienced by\n            Argentina from 1998 until project closure had a significant\n            negative impact on construction firms, which in turn\n            affected project implementation. Procurement problems and\n            architectural problems also caused delays. Key lessons\n            learned from the implementation of the project include: 1)\n            The Bank should encourage the Borrower to request a\n            reformulation of a project if and when it becomes clear that\n            the development objectives are no longer feasible. 2)\n            Operations requiring provincial commitments should obtain\n            those commitments before project approval. 3) A reform is a\n            political process first, and only later a technical process.\n            It requires on both a creation of the political viability\n            and development of technical feasibility. 4) In a\n            reform-oriented project, investment in civil works should be\n            made contingent on adoption of specific changes in the\n            sectoral \"software\" (e.g., management, human\n            resources, or the other subjects of the reform). 5) Intense\n            supervision is crucial for smooth project implementation,\n            particularly in the face of political turbulence."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Provincial Health Sector\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Provincial Health\n            Sector Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1965806/argentina-provincial-health-sector-development-project","projn":"AR-Prov.
