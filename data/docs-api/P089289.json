The initial five land use\n            and management plans prepared under this project have\n            demonstrated that land use and management planning is a very\n            powerful tool that can be used to produce consensus and\n            limit conflicts among land users.

   outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: communities with limited technical\n            capacities and weak control mechanisms, financial\n            decentralization should follow a phased approach, which\n            fully capitalizes on past experience. The first phase of the\n            project successfully tested a mechanism for channeling\n            resources to communes and communities. This success gave\n            sufficient confidence to the Government, which enacted a\n            decision to transfer areas of competence and associated\n            resources for nine ministries to the communes, one of the\n            greatest achievements of the project was to create a new\n            environment for local development planning, financing and\n            management, leading to a greater command of the local\n            development process by communities, and to an improved\n            delivery of basic social services, simplicity in the process\n            of preparing local and communal development plans would\n            strengthen ownership and improve implementation efficiency.\n            A shortcoming of the project was the lack of a mechanism to\n            monitor communal development plans, as well as the absence\n            of expertise to provide operational content to the strategic\n            elements of the plans, a systematic use of simplified guides\n            and procedural manuals is critical for quality insurance and\n            greater fiduciary compliance at local level, sectoral\n            ministries have a critical role to play in ensuring quality\n            control of infrastructure realized through the local\n            development process; situations of conflict of interest are\n            to be avoided, financing communal agents is a smart\n            investment for increasing communal fiscal space and tax\n            revenues, using in-kind contributions of beneficiaries\n            provides a greater flexibility in financing local\n            development; however, this mode of financing is also source\n            of quality issues and implementation

Development Program, by\n            complementing local and national benefits, with key global\n            benefits, such as conservation of globally significant\n            biodiversity, reduction of carbon emissions by improving\n            land management activities and rehabilitating degraded\n            lands, as well as increasing carbon sequestration.\n            Furthermore, the project will stabilize riparian zones, and\n            reduce sediment discharges into critical trans-boundary\n            water bodies, such as Lake Chad and the Gulf of Guinea. The\n            project has three main components: 1) enhanced integration\n            of SLM into local development; 2) institutional support for\n            SLM; and, 3) project management, coordination, monitoring\n            and evaluation, and communication. The first component will\n            co-finance SLM micro-projects, at the request of\n            beneficiaries (communities and communes), within the\n            project's intervention zone. The second component will\n            reinforce the institutional framework at the national level,\n            and strengthen the capacities of beneficiaries to better\n            integrate SLM best practices in their local development\n            plans. It also seeks to improve the mechanism of land\n            conflict resolution, among farmers, foresters, herders,\n            other natural resource users, and traditional chiefs.\n            Finally, the third component will ensure appropriate project\n            management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and communication."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Sustainable

aims to reduce poverty by\n            promoting sustainable rural development, including\n            marginalized groups. The indigenous people development plan\n            (IPDP) identified a numbers of risks the indigenous peoples\n            (IPs) could face as result of the implementation of the\n            project, if left unattended. Such risks could include\n            further marginalization; fewer government services; loss of\n            control over land traditionally use by IPs as a source of\n            livelihood and basis for their cultural and social system;\n            less access to education, health services and clean water,\n            and less income from agricultural production. The IPDP makes\n            specific recommendations which have been agreed with the\n            Cameroonian authorities designated to mitigate these risks,\n            as follows : equal legal opportunities to IPs such as the\n            provision of ID cards; establishment of community forests or\n            traditional hunting zones; participation in the elaboration\n            of community development plans and development of local\n            action plans; equal opportunities such as special programs\n            for pygmees to benefit from job creation opportunities;\n            inclusion of IPs in various PNDP committees; provision of\n            training on intercultural communication to civil servants\n            working with pygmy populations; equal opportunities such as\n            assisting Baka and Kola associations in capacity building to\n            preserve the loss of traditional knowledge, culture and\n            livelihood patterns; foster the creation of forums for\n            communication and exchange between pygmies and other ethnic\n            groups; and finally, in an effort to implement these\n            recommendations, hire a consultant to carryout a study that\n            will facilitate the participation of IPs in the\n            socio-economic development activities generated by the project"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indigenous people (Pygmy) development plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Sustainable\n            Agro-Pastoral and Land Management Promotion under the PNDP\n            Project : Indigenous people (Pygmy) development plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/08/6261362/cameroon-sustainable-agro-pastoral-land-management-promotion-under-pndp-project-indigenous-people-pygmy-development-plan","projn":"CM-Sustainable Agro-Pastoral And Land\n            Management Promotion Under T -- P089289","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","count":"Cameroon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20050831121713"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Global Environment Project","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":","}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 3 (AFTS3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF055031-GEF PDFB-CAMEROON:SUSTAINABLE\n            AGRO-PASTORAL AND LAND MANAGEMENT PROMOTI","repnb":"IPP141"},"facets":{}}}
