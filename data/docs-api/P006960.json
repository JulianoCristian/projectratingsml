It has 17 regional and 5\n            non-regional country members. Its purpose is to contribute\n            to the economic development of the region. The Bank has\n            maintained a close relationship to CDB since its inception,\n            both through the provision of technical assistance and the\n            granting of two previous loans/credits. The Bank's\n            objectives have been to help build CDB into an increasingly\n            effective institution and to use it as a channel for\n            financing small projects in the Caribbean which would\n            otherwise be too costly and difficult for the Bank to\n            appraise and supervise. Bank Group funds have been used for\n            public and private sector projects of the types which the\n            Bank normally finances. The proposed credit will be for the\n            same purposes and objectives as the previous operations,\n            except that it will be restricted to the smallest and\n            poorest CDB member countries.

It has 17 regional and 5\n            non-regional country members. Its purpose is to contribute\n            to the economic development of the region. The Bank has\n            maintained a close relationship to CDB since its inception,\n            both through the provision of technical assistance and the\n            granting of two previous loans/credits. The Bank's\n            objectives have been to help build CDB into an increasingly\n            effective institution and to use it as a channel for\n            financing small projects in the Caribbean which would\n            otherwise be too costly and difficult for the Bank to\n            appraise and supervise. Bank Group funds have been used for\n            public and private sector projects of the types which the\n            Bank normally finances. The proposed credit will be for the\n            same purposes and objectives as the previous operations,\n            except that it will be restricted to the smallest and\n            poorest CDB member countries. CDB has, at the present time,\n            sufficient hard capital resources available so that IBRD\n            funds are not required as a part of the proposed project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Caribbean Region - Third Caribbean\n            Development Bank Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Caribbean Region - Third\n            Caribbean Development Bank Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/04/725394/caribbean-region-third-caribbean-development-bank-project","projn":"6R-Cdb III (Sdr-6.5) -- P006960","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Rural Finance,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Caribbean","entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810190101577"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,affiliate,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,appropriate\n            technology,Auditors,balance of payments,Balance\n            Sheets,banking system,borrowing,capital goods,Caribbean\n            Development Bank,CDB,CDF,central bank,Central Banks,clearing\n            house,commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,creditworthiness,debt,deposits,Developed\n            Countries,development banking,development projects,economic\n            cooperation,Economic Development,economic effects,economic\n            growth,economic integration,economic performance,economic\n            policies,economic problems,economic rate of\n            return,Economics,economies of\n            scale,economists,employment,energy consumption,equity\n            capital,equity investments,exports,Finance\n            Companies,financial institutions,financial\n            intermediaries,financial policies,financial\n            resources,Financial Sector,foreign exchange,Free\n            Trade,GNP,GNP per capita,government\n            subsidies,IDB,imports,incentive\n            systems,Income,inflation,interest rates,labor force,labor\n            productivity,LDCs,Less Developed Countries,liquidity,loan\n            financing,loan supervision,MDB,migration,Monetary\n            Authorities,natural resources,oil,operating\n            costs,organizational structure,pricing\n            policies,producers,productivity,public\n            agencies,savings,Shareholders,subsidiary,support\n            services,Technical Assistance,terms of trade,trade\n            barriers,trade liberalization,transport,underlying\n            problems,value added,wages,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,affiliate,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,appropriate\n            technology,Auditors,balance of payments,Balance\n            Sheets,banking system,borrowing,capital goods,Caribbean\n            Development Bank,CDB,CDF,central bank,Central Banks,clearing\n            house,commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,creditworthiness,debt,deposits,Developed\n            Countries,development banking,development projects,economic\n            cooperation,Economic Development,economic effects,economic\n            growth,economic integration,economic performance,economic\n            policies,economic problems,economic rate of\n            return,Economics,economies of\n            scale,economists,employment,energy consumption,equity\n            capital,equity investments,exports,Finance\n            Companies,financial institutions,financial\n            intermediaries,financial policies,financial\n            resources,Financial Sector,foreign exchange,Free\n            Trade,GNP,GNP per capita,government\n            subsidies,IDB,imports,incentive\n            systems,Income,inflation,interest rates,labor force,labor\n            productivity,LDCs,Less Developed Countries,liquidity,loan\n            financing,loan supervision,MDB,migration,Monetary\n            Authorities,natural resources,oil,operating\n            costs,organizational structure,pricing\n            policies,producers,productivity,public\n            agencies,savings,Shareholders,subsidiary,support\n            services,Technical Assistance,terms of trade,trade\n            barriers,trade liberalization,transport,underlying\n            problems,value added,wages,water supply"}},"owner":"Caribbean Countries CMU (LCC3C)","repnb":"4338"},"facets":{}}}
