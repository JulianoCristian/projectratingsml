Lessons point at the\n            need for a strong Government commitment for single tranche\n            adjustment, provided such operations are undertaken within a\n            well structured medium-term framework. While single tranche\n            loans are more flexible, given they preclude legal\n            conditions and policy targets (possibly not supported by\n            Government), they do depend on continuous monitoring, and\n            policy dialogue during implementation. Hence, these\n            discussions allow periodic adjustments, and refinement of\n            conditions, and facilitates a learning-by-doing process.\n            Contrary to the fact that the interest of line ministries in\n            adjustment loans is usually weak, due to the political costs\n            involved, in this case, the supportive approach of a\n            stronger ministry, the Prime Minister's Office,\n            contributed to success. And a way to increase line ministry\n            support, would be to include technical assistance, and or\n            investment components in the adjustment loan. This said, the\n            experience with hybrid loans, is evidently poor in Europe\n            and Central Asia region. Regarding major policy formulation\n            changes, and consensus building, policy-relevant analytical\n            work becomes highly valuable for discussing the findings\n            with the government, and major stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Second Agriculture Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Second Agriculture\n            Sector Adjustment Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1962147/bulgaria-second-agriculture-sector-adjustment-loan-project","projn":"BG-Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan 2\n            (Asal 2) -- P057926","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Bulgaria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02080104011662"},"subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Irrigation and drainage,Law and justice,Banking,Housing finance","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to\n            credit,accountability,accounting,agricultural\n            growth,agricultural production,Agriculture,assets,bank\n            failures,bank lending,bank loans,Bank Performance,banking\n            system,business plans,cereals,climate\n            change,collateralization,commercial\n            banks,commodities,competitiveness,contract\n            enforcement,crops,Development Strategy,diseases,Economic\n            Cooperation,employment,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,exports,farmers,farms,feed,fertilizers,financial\n            institutions,financial markets,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            processing,food production,Food Security,forest\n            management,Forestry,Forests,GDP,government\n            intervention,Gross Value,import\n            tariffs,imports,income,income\n            distribution,incomes,information disclosure,institutional\n            change,Institutional Development,insurance,international\n            trade,Irrigation,Irrigation Systems,labor force,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,livestock,market\n            prices,marketing,municipalities,new entrants,poverty\n            rates,poverty reduction,price increases,private\n            sector,privatization,producers,productivity,resource\n            use,Rural Development,rural income,rural population,rural\n            poverty,Savings,small business,taxation,technical\n            assistance,trade liberalization,UNDP,USAID,Value\n            Added,wages,wheat,wood,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Access to\n            credit,accountability,accounting,agricultural\n            growth,agricultural production,Agriculture,assets,bank\n            failures,bank lending,bank loans,Bank Performance,banking\n            system,business plans,cereals,climate\n            change,collateralization,commercial\n            banks,commodities,competitiveness,contract\n            enforcement,crops,Development Strategy,diseases,Economic\n            Cooperation,employment,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,exports,farmers,farms,feed,fertilizers,financial\n            institutions,financial markets,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            processing,food production,Food Security,forest\n            management,Forestry,Forests,GDP,government\n            intervention,Gross Value,import\n            tariffs,imports,income,income\n            distribution,incomes,information disclosure,institutional\n            change,Institutional Development,insurance,international\n            trade,Irrigation,Irrigation Systems,labor force,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,livestock,market\n            prices,marketing,municipalities,new entrants,poverty\n            rates,poverty reduction,price increases,private\n            sector,privatization,producers,productivity,resource\n            use,Rural Development,rural income,rural population,rural\n            poverty,Savings,small business,taxation,technical\n            assistance,trade liberalization,UNDP,USAID,Value\n            Added,wages,wheat,wood,working capital"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF026183-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR\n            ADJUSTMENT LOAN II PROJECT,TF039775-BULGARIA - ASAL II,TF039673-BULGARIA - ASAL II,TF029304-PHRD-IRRIGATION RESTRUCTURING\n            & REHAB.
