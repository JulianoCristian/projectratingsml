Some lessons learned includes: one\n            of the key lessons that this project illustrated was the\n            need to have a project design that focus on end goals and\n            not be too rigid in the implementation modalities to achieve\n            these. A key lesson learned has been that, in complex river\n            basins with largely entrenched government positions, it is\n            critical to broaden the stakeholder pool for engagement.\n            Often, such projects support the development of high-quality\n            multi-sectoral knowledge bases, modeling tools, and\n            technical reports. However, these often remain accessible\n            only by a select few, and new researchers and technical\n            specialists have to often start from scratch. A key decision\n            that has to be made when embarking on the analysis of a\n            basin as complex as the Eastern Nile is to be decide which\n            modeling framework should be utilized. For effective\n            communication of complex issues in the Eastern Nile and\n            change entrenched mindsets, it is critical that information\n            be communicated in customized ways to target different\n            stakeholders. It is often difficult to effectively engage\n            potential users of knowledge and analytical systems without\n            something to show initially. If early efforts are done to\n            pilot the knowledge base and tools, it would be easier to\n            attract a range of potential users and keep them engaged\n            throughout the

In particular, this minor extension will allow the\n            project to be consistent with the Nile Basin Decision\n            Support System activities (given the close\n            inter-relationship of activities that is being pursued with\n            ENPM) and allow for continuity into a new overall NBI\n            project that is expected to start on January 1, 2013. This\n            will enable the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office\n            (ENTRO) to systematically complete its internship program\n            under the project and complete the training and capacity\n            development activities related to spatial analysis, model\n            development, knowledge products, and portal development\n            under the project.

There are three\n            components to the project, the first component being\n            knowledge base development. The knowledge base developed\n            will provide a shared, synoptic view of the Eastern Nile\n            basins, including its opportunities and risks as viewed from\n            an economic, environmental and social perspective.  Baseline\n            data will be organized systematically in a Geographic\n            Information System (GIS) platform with an associated web\n            portal. Effective use will be made of modern datasets from\n            satellite remote sensing and other global or regional\n            datasets. The second component is the modeling system. The\n            models will build on a water systems 'spine' using\n            tools developed by the Nile Basin Decision Support System\n            (DSS) to help analyze the economic, environmental and social\n            aspects of investments in a water resources systems\n            framework and to evaluate alternative scenarios of the\n            future.  The tools developed will draw upon and contribute\n            to the knowledge base developed and will be flexible to\n            adapt to changing needs and increasing information\n            availability.
