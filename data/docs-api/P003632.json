The reasons for success in technical\n            assistance (TA) and capacity building projects outline five\n            factors, namely, overall country policy and institutional\n            capability, country income level, strong borrower ownership\n            and implementing agencies managerial capacity, use of local\n            consultants, and, intensive Bank supervision, all of which\n            contributed to the success of the Project. Yet, regardless\n            of success, several lessons suggest the following.\n            Methodologies for project design, performance monitoring and\n            evaluation, suggest that even newer mechanisms for project\n            management are of limited and variable operational utility,\n            unless a careful, selective approach is taken in designing\n            them, and using them with common sense, as part of a shared\n            effort at performance improvement over the long term, where\n            indicators can make an important contribution to project\n            effectiveness, and capacity development. Centralized\n            procurement of scientific equipment seems to have been a\n            problem, however, a decentralized approach might have been\n            better, particularly given the large number of institutions\n            involved, and a larger allowance provided for procurement on\n            the basis of shopping. Notwithstanding, the success of the\n            Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) component emphasizes the\n            value of designing such projects in an integrated way, to\n            address all elements of the research agenda: upgrading\n            facilities, procuring scientific equipment, computers and\n            software, and, training personnel, with an emphasis on\n            overseas training and increasing international cooperative research."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

More specifically, it\n            addresses identified needs that emerged from the\n            Environmental Strategy Paper and its review with the\n            Government. Those needs are: (a) to improve coordination of\n            environmental monitoring and ecological research; (b) to\n            promote cleaner industrial production, pollution prevention\n            and waste minimization technologies; (c) to enhance economic\n            policy instruments for pollution control, especially the\n            pollution levy system; and (d) to strengthen the Chinese\n            system of environmental assessments (EA). Another objective\n            is to improve interagency and interministerial coordination\n            for improved environmental management. The project consists\n            of three main components: (i) CAS ecological research and\n            monitoring which began in 1989 to design a Chinese Ecosystem\n            Research Network (CERN) to strengthen long-term ecological\n            research in China and to generate scientifically-valid\n            ecological information that could be used for sustainable\n            natural resource management and agricultural development;\n            (ii) NEPA technical assistance program provides technical\n            assistance; and (iii) environmental impact assessment system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Environmental Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Environmental Technical\n            Assistance
