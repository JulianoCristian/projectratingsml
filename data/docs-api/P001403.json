Project design, particularly in countries\n            with low capacity, should be taken carefully: specifically,\n            the time needed for the reform process to achieve results\n            should receive special attention, and it may be prudent to\n            seek progress in small incremental steps. Moreover, given\n            privatized road maintenance may yield significant benefits\n            for the road sector in low-income developing countries, it\n            was demonstrated by the project that difficulties will\n            occur, and, provided the steps necessary to implement the\n            transition in such environment. Effective Road Funds need\n            adequate revenue, independence, and an effective governance\n            structure.
