Some lessons learned includes: the\n            operation emphasized the crucial importance of understanding\n            the political economy context for policy reforms. The\n            financial crisis highlighted the need for Mongolia to\n            improve its overall policy framework in order to prevent\n            future boom-and-bust cycles, and provided a key window of\n            opportunity for engagement by the World Bank and other\n            partners.

Program (DPC2) for Mongolia supports the continued efforts\n            of the government to use the crisis as an opportunity to\n            improve macro and fiscal sustainability in a mineral-based\n            economy, protect the poor and vulnerable, restore confidence\n            in the financial sector, and encourage transparent and\n            prudent mining investments. The global downturn hit Mongolia\n            hard. This downturn was most immediately felt through the\n            collapse of mineral prices, in particular that of copper.\n            Given Mongolia's high reliance on copper revenues in\n            the budget (with mineral revenues accounting for more than\n            one-third of the total budget revenues), the fiscal shock\n            was very large, causing the overall government balance to\n            shift from a 2.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\n            surplus in 2007 to a 5.4 percent deficit in 2009. Improving\n            the policy environment is now the overriding priority for\n            the government. Multilateral and bilateral donor activities\n            in the form of budget financing, technical assistance and\n            analytical work provide an important support for the\n            government's policy agenda. Considerable fiscal\n            adjustment remains necessary over the next couple of years.\n            Donor budget financing can play a crucial role in\n            facilitating the process of fiscal adjustment, helping to\n            protect key expenditures such as social protection and\n            investment programs or to limit the recourse to alternative,\n            potentially destabilizing, and financing options."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Second Development Policy Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Second Development\n            Policy
