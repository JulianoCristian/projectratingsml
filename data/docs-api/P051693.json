The\n            project objective has been met; the project has been highly\n            successful in promoting the strengthening of Salta's\n            fiscal situation. The operation has promoted the\n            implementation of important reforms in the health and\n            education sectors aimed at ensuring an efficient and\n            responsive delivery of public services within fiscally-sound\n            policies. The key lessons of experience include: 1)\n            Quick-disbursing loans supporting well-defined reforms can\n            be effective tools in promoting structural adjustment at the\n            sub-national level. 2) For the reforms to be sustainable, a\n            consistent system of incentives has to be in place at the\n            national and provincial levels. 3) It is important to\n            capitalize on potential windows of opportunities. 4) The\n            success of structural adjustment loans (SALs) depend on a\n            combination of factors, among the most important of which is\n            strong political support. 5) Provincial SAL operations\n            require strong coordination across sectors to ensure that\n            policy conditionality reinforce the strategies adopted in\n            each sector. 6) It is important to enhance public\n            participation and to educate the general public on the goals\n            and objectives of the reforms to ensure their success and\n            sustainability. 6) The combination of effective sector\n            leadership for reforms and participatory mechanisms in the\n            design and implementation of reforms is a powerful tool for\n            pursuing institutional change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Second Provincial Reform Project\n            :

Projects will help the Tucuman, Rio Negro, Salta and\n            San Juan provinces to reform and restructure their\n            governments to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery\n            of public services (notably social services) within fiscally\n            sound policies. The loan will be disbursed depending on\n            successful implementation of the following reforms and\n            performance benchmarks: 1) public performance reviews will\n            assess: whether overall fiscal and debt targets were\n            reached, the composition of social sector expenditures, the\n            rationale for new borrowing to refinance old debt and/or to\n            finance priority investment programs, and the economic\n            justification for all large projects; 2) public finance\n            reforms include reestablishing provincial fiscal balance by\n            improving tax collection, reducing current government\n            expenditures - namely civil service reductions, and\n            shrinking provincial debt; 3) selected education reforms\n            include consolidating classes, controlling absenteeism,\n            reducing overhead costs, reconverting public teacher\n            training institutions, and introducing new subsidy systems\n            for private schools; benchmarks include reducing\n            non-essential personnel, improving student-teacher ratios,\n            and shifting personnel expenditures towards investment and\n            other outlays; and 4) selected health reforms include\n            separating provision and financing of public health services\n            by giving hospitals autonomy, implementing new management\n            and payment systems, improving insurance coverage by\n            identifying poor beneficiaries, defining the health package,\n            and legally implementing the new insurance system prior to\n            the last tranche release."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Four Second Provincial Reform\n            Adjustment Loan Projects - Rio
