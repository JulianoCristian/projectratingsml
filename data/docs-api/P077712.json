Some\n            lessons learned included: the link between project's\n            activities and the outcome indicators for the quality and\n            management components was not clearly addressed in the\n            project document. As a result, these indicators could not\n            adequately measure the achievements or progress made under\n            these components. To maintain the focus on project\n            development objectives during the implementation and to\n            clearly address how different activities and components fit\n            together, creating a well-defined results framework is\n            critical. Project teams need to make sure that the framework\n            articulates the link between outputs and outcomes, by\n            setting intermediate indicators which adequately measure the\n            interim changes toward achieving the objectives. If the\n            focus of the activities changed over the course of the\n            project, the indicators should be reviewed and modified\n            accordingly. The project aimed at enhancing quality while\n            expanding access to secondary education. As commonly seen in\n            many education projects, an expansion of access has led to a\n            large influx of new students with a wide range of abilities,\n            posing a considerable challenge on schools to meet these\n            students' needs. A rapid expansion of access can\n            undermine the quality of teaching and learning. With this in\n            mind, realistic targets should be set for quality\n            improvement, particularly for learning outcomes, when a\n            project seeks dual enhancement of access and quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia - Organization of Eastern\n            Caribbean States (OECS) Education Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"St. Lucia - Organization

St. Lucia and St. Kitts\n            and Nevis are the first of the OECS countries to join the\n            program. There are three main project components. The first\n            increases equitable access and equity in secondary\n            education, particularly in poor rural communities, by\n            constructing a new secondary school in St. Kitts and\n            providing equipment, furniture, and materials; and expanding\n            the school meals program in secondary schools. The second\n            component comprises 4 subcomponents, which 1) develop\n            curriculum for Forms i-III and provide instructional guides,\n            textbooks, ad other resource materials; train\n            trainers/educators in select areas, including fellowships,\n            and development of a coordinated teacher appraisal system;\n            2) establish learning resource centers, and expand and\n            upgrade learning centers, including science and information\n            technology labs; 3) elaborate program to support\n            participation of disadvantaged students, and related teacher\n            development in special education; and, 4) provide\n            school-based improvement projects, and extra-curricular\n            activities.
