Sector-wide lessons\n            highlight the quality of the initial project design which\n            was clear and relatively simple, yet not simplistic: the\n            components were both consistent for the stakeholders and\n            understandable to the public. This ensured clear guidance to\n            all those involved in implementation. Nevertheless, areas of\n            weakness point at the absence of a sector-wide base-line\n            survey, which could have been carried out at the start of\n            the Project. In the specific case of Moldova, such a survey\n            would have clearly displayed the state of art of the current\n            system; at the same time, it would have constituted a\n            valuable frame of reference for any further project\n            evaluation. Moreover, the project did not have a clear set\n            of quality indicators and quality monitoring mechanisms.\n            This proved necessary; and the implementation quality\n            monitoring should have been in place as of the early stages,\n            offering valuable and timely data for further improvements.\n            The institutional reform undertaken under the project\n            covered mostly Ministry or Ministry-related bodies. While\n            this was part of the first reform steps and cannot be\n            considered a weakness, schools need more support to shift\n            from their status of mere implementing bodies, to the one of\n            responsible learning organizations, and it is this that\n            should be addressed in future projects. Similarly,\n            intermediate level managers - i.e. rayon inspectors,\n            methodologists and school managers - should have been\n            specifically trained for the implementation process. The\n            discrepancy between the training provided to teachers, and\n            the one for school administrators and inspectors was a\n            highly dysfunctional factor during the implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - General Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - General Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5637157/moldova-general-education-project","projn":"MD-General Education -- P008558","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Girls Education","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Moldova","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050303094829"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Secondary education,Primary education","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement, achievements, addition,\n            assessment methods, assessment tools, basic education,\n            classroom teaching, Compulsory Education, curricula,\n            Curriculum Development, curriculum implementation,\n            curriculum reform, curriculum standards, decentralization,\n            depression, education curriculum, Education Law, education\n            reform, education sector, Educational Development,\n            educational measurement, Educational Sciences, enrollment,\n            enrollment rates, factual knowledge, families, Geography,\n            history textbooks, independent learning, information needs,\n            intervention, interventions, learning, learning approaches,\n            learning materials, learning outcomes, learning practices,\n            learning process, learning processes, learning skills,\n            learning technologies, Lessons Learned, libraries, library\n            books, living standards, managers, mathematics, migration,\n            Mother Tongue, motivation, national assessments, National\n            Curriculum, needs assessment, Net enrollment, parents,\n            participation rates, PCD, philosophy, Primary education,\n            primary school, primary school textbooks, printing, problem\n            solving skills, project implementation, Project Preparation,\n            quality of education, questioning, reading, reading\n            comprehension, Reading Materials, refresher courses,\n            resource teachers, Retraining, school libraries, school\n            subjects, schools, Secondary education, secondary school\n            textbooks, social services, SPORTS, student performance,\n            syllabi, teacher, teacher trainers, teacher training,\n            teachers, teaching, teaching aids, teaching materials,\n            teaching process, Tertiary education, Textbooks, training\n            centers, training courses, training of teachers, training\n            programs, universities, university curriculum, university\n            Education, values education"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF026061-TA CTF FOR MOLDOVA HEALTH &\n            S.

The\n            project's key objective is to modernize and improve the\n            quality of primary and lower secondary education. Its four\n            components consist of curriculum development, textbook\n            production and financing, learning assessment, and\n            in-service teacher training. The first component, curriculum\n            development, comprises (1) establishing an integrated\n            institutional structure for curriculum development and\n            assessment/evaluation, (2) developing and establishing\n            updated subject curricula for grades 1-9, and (3) supporting\n            teachers with the implementation of the new curriculum. The\n            learning assessment component improves the assessment and\n            examination system in five key areas: (1) integrating\n            assessment objectives into the new curriculum; (2) improving\n            key national examinations at grades 4 and 9; (3) developing\n            and disseminating assessment materials to teachers for key\n            subjects; (4) training trainers in the use of these\n            materials; and (5) conducting a sample-based survey of\n            student achievements to compare performance before and after\n            the project's implementation. The teacher training\n            component will finance technical assistance, development and\n            dissemination of training materials, implementation of\n            centralized courses for trainers and decentralized courses\n            for teachers, and provide necessary equipment. The textbook\n            development and financing component will finance producing\n            new textbooks and textbook guides in the mother tongue for\n            core subjects for grades 3-9; support a new cost recovery\n            system for textbooks; and provide training and technical\n            assistance for Ministry staff, textbook evaluation\n            committees, and publishers in competitive bidding\n            procedures. Finally, the project will finance technical\n            assistance, equipment and incremental operating costs\n            necessary for project management and studies needed to\n            prepare for a possible future project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - General Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - General Education
