Project sustainability is unlikely: to a large\n            extent it depends on factors that are the result of overall\n            Government policies and/or in Tajikistan's\n            macro-economic conditions and are therefore, outside the\n            control of the project area's population and/or\n            authorities. Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            adjudged as satisfactory despite the shortfall in Bank\n            budgetary resources and the prevailing circumstances.\n            Lessons learned included the following: Projects like this\n            that are prepared in a very short time with a view to\n            respond swiftly to a natural disaster or another emergency,\n            cannot be prepared with the same degree of detail as a\n            traditional operation. They have to have built-in a great\n            deal of flexibility to adequately address unforeseeable\n            needs as they revolve from the reconstruction process. In\n            keeping with the political nature of the project objective,\n            the project coordination unit tried to spread project\n            operations geographically as widely as possible with the aim\n            of reaching out to the communities. While logical from a\n            political perspective, this approach made visibility more\n            important than realistically assessing the usefulness of the\n            operation for community development. A related issue is the\n            diversity of sectors coverd by the project; was the modest\n            objective already too ambitious given the country's\n            capacity and budget resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan -
