The project largely\n            achieved its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of the Bank was highly satisfactory\n            while the Borrower's was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, the sector\n            reorganization that entailed the establishment of autonomous\n            agencies and private sector participation served to\n            significantly improve sector performance. Second, universal\n            improvements in efficiency should not be taken for granted,\n            even in a privately operated system. Third, when a lease\n            contract is being designed, short-term and long-term\n            incentive structures should be carefully created to meet\n            precisely articulated objectives to maximize the efficiency\n            of the private sector operations. Fourth, in the interest of\n            consumer protection, a strong regulatory and oversight\n            function is very important to control private sector\n            operations. Finally, to increase transparency in operations\n            when a private operator functions as a system operator and\n            construction contractor, separate financial statements of\n            its different functions are highly recommended."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Second Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Second Water Supply
