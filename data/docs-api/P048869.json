Some lessons\n            learned included: turnkey contracts work quite well when\n            there are no changes to the original designs. However, when\n            the government introduces a change or variation the\n            situation can turn problematic. The main cause is how to\n            valuate the cost of the variation. This was the case in the\n            Bonoco station and adjacent stretch when the government\n            changed them from at grade to elevate after the\n            reformulation of the project. The resulting uncertainty in\n            the cost gave the opportunity to the Tribunal Federal de\n            Contas da Uniao (TCU) to oversee the entire project, and as\n            a result fine the contractor and generate delays. The\n            Salvador Urban Transport project illustrates the importance\n            of introducing flexibility into the planning and\n            implementation of a large project like this one. This\n            flexibility allowed the project to survive through\n            incredibly difficult times, represented by economic crisis,\n            large devaluations, and lack of counterpart funds. Similar\n            to the Belo Horizonte and Recife railway decentralization\n            projects sponsored by the World Bank, the Salvador project\n            illustrates the convenience of such process. Ridership in\n            the Calcada Paripe Commuter line between Calcada and Paripe\n            (STU/SAL) line is increasing thanks to the upgrading of the\n            stations and fleet, and the doubling of the fleet but also\n            because local appointed management is under more pressure to\n            show results and is directly accountable to the Mayor.\n            Thanks to decentralization and transfer of ownership to the\n            state and municipal levels, service provision is closer to\n            the passenger and tends to improve in order to attract\n            passengers. The Bank should continue to support similar\n            decentralization efforts in urban transport service\n            provision although it must be careful in evaluating the\n            source for the operating subsidies required in view of the\n            buying power of the users which in general are of very low-income."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Salvador Urban Transport

institutional and policy development. This\n            report overviews the environmental impact assessment on the\n            integrated transportation system of Salvador. The impacts\n            over the biotic media are considered to be light. Negative\n            impacts and their mitigation measures relate both to the\n            construction and operational phases. Physical impacts\n            include: a) water, drainage, and water resources pollution;\n            b) noise/vibration - significant during construction -\n            mitigated by the minimum use of percussive construction\n            methods and careful evaluation of slopes and existing\n            building foundations; c) air pollution - mitigation includes\n            taking present levels into consideration when creating the\n            forced ventilation system; and d) landscape & visual\n            impacts - mitigated by use of strict control of relocation\n            effort and land occupation after construction. Social\n            impacts including personal and commercial relocation as well\n            as increased accidents (during construction) will be\n            mitigated by a widespread information plan, a carefully\n            designed relocation plan, and a campaign of Environmental\n            education.
