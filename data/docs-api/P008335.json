Lessons\n            reinforce that institutional reform projects such as this\n            one, can be successful in building capacities to support the\n            private agricultural sector, even when government has lagged\n            in reforming trade, and price policies, privatization of\n            agro-kombinats, and state-owned land, as well as for other\n            policies, fundamental to long-run market-oriented\n            agriculture sector development. Basically, projects designed\n            to improve institutional performance, can be implemented\n            before economic reforms are completed. Another lesson\n            conveys that if an agricultural institutional development\n            project is to be evaluated in terms of quantified impacts on\n            farmer incomes, (1) the difficulty of this must be\n            recognized, (2) the logic of the quantification must\n            therefore be specified in detail early on, (3) the project\n            must not become effective until precise, defined baseline\n            data to support the evaluation are available, (4) data\n            collection, and monitoring must be rigorously implemented\n            during the project, and, (5) all these expensive monitoring\n            and evaluation activities, must be adequately financed as\n            part of the project. Competitive grant schemes financed by\n            the project, show that useful research can be developed, and\n            transferred to farmers. However, experience also suggests\n            that effective competitive grant management requires strong,\n            independent supervision, and regular financial, and\n            scientific auditing. In this context, farmer representation\n            on advisory boards is often notional, and rarely democratic,\n            while research, and program supervision is often under\n            funded, and insufficiently independent. To be effective in\n            satisfying the research needs of small private farmers in\n            the long run, the government should therefore, start an\n            ongoing process of reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Farmer Support Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Farmer Support Services

providing technology-related support services\n            that are relevant to the private farmers. The aim is to\n            improve the income of the private farming community and\n            increase its productivity and hence the competitiveness of\n            the sector. The project will address the need: 1) to change\n            delivery mechanisms for the provision of technical services\n            to the private farming community; and 2) for institutional\n            restructuring to meet the needs of a market economy.\n            Increased farmer ownership and accountability of the\n            agricultural knowledge system are also essential elements of\n            project design. The provision of relevant and efficient\n            veterinary services and support for the shift from a\n            grain-based animal production system to a lower cost\n            pasture-based livestock industry are other central\n            objectives. In addition, rationalizing the regulatory\n            framework for the seed industry will be supported. The\n            project will furthermore seek to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Forestry's policy formulation\n            capabilities and the agriculture data base in order to\n            ensure more rational policy decisions in the future.\n            Finally, the project consists of the six following\n            components: 1) extension; 2) research; 3) animal health; 4)\n            pasture and fodder development; 5) seed industry\n            development; and 6) policy analysis support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Farmer Support Services

providing technology-related support services\n            that are relevant to the private farmers. The aim is to\n            improve the income of the private farming community and\n            increase its productivity and hence the competitiveness of\n            the sector. The project will address the need: 1) to change\n            delivery mechanisms for the provision of technical services\n            to the private farming community; and 2) for institutional\n            restructuring to meet the needs of a market economy.\n            Increased farmer ownership and accountability of the\n            agricultural knowledge system are also essential elements of\n            project design. The provision of relevant and efficient\n            veterinary services and support for the shift from a\n            grain-based animal production system to a lower cost\n            pasture-based livestock industry are other central\n            objectives. In addition, rationalizing the regulatory\n            framework for the seed industry will be supported. The\n            project will furthermore seek to strengthen the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Forestry's policy formulation\n            capabilities and the agriculture data base in order to\n            ensure more rational policy decisions in the future.\n            Finally, the project consists of the six following\n            components: 1) extension; 2) research; 3) animal health; 4)\n            pasture and fodder development; 5) seed industry\n            development; and 6) policy analysis support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Farmer Support Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Farmer Support Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/02/732691/croatia-farmer-support-services-project","projn":"HR-Farmer Support Services Project -- P008335","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,ICT Policy and Strategies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Research,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies","count":"Croatia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008050134"},"subsc":"Agricultural Extension, Research, and Other\n            Support Activities,Central Government","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Advisory Committees,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural practices,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,Animal\n            Health,BANK LOANS,central planning,commercial\n            banks,commodities,community participation,Competitive\n            Bidding,competitiveness,computer equipment,Consulting\n            Services,crops,decision making,decision-making,Economic Rate\n            of Return,Economics,equipment,EXCHANGE\n            RATES,exercises,Extension,extension services,FAO,farmer\n            participation,Farmers,farming,farms,field\n            trials,Forestry,GATT,GDP,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Health\n            Legislation,health services,import\n            quotas,inheritance,Integrated Pest Management,interest\n            rate,irrigation,isolation,Livestock,living\n            standards,marketing,mass\n            media,media,monopolies,Participatory\n            Approach,poultry,private sector,quality\n            control,quarantine,regulatory framework,regulatory\n            policy,research policy,research results,scientific\n            community,sustainable agriculture,Technical Assistance,total\n            costs,training courses,veterinary services"},"1":{"cdata!":"Advisory Committees,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural practices,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,Animal\n            Health,BANK LOANS,central planning,commercial\n            banks,commodities,community participation,Competitive\n            Bidding,competitiveness,computer equipment,Consulting\n            Services,crops,decision making,decision-making,Economic Rate\n            of Return,Economics,equipment,EXCHANGE\n            RATES,exercises,Extension,extension services,FAO,farmer\n            participation,Farmers,farming,farms,field\n            trials,Forestry,GATT,GDP,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Health\n            Legislation,health services,import\n            quotas,inheritance,Integrated Pest Management,interest\n            rate,irrigation,isolation,Livestock,living\n            standards,marketing,mass\n            media,media,monopolies,Participatory\n            Approach,poultry,private sector,quality\n            control,quarantine,regulatory framework,regulatory\n            policy,research policy,research results,scientific\n            community,sustainable agriculture,Technical Assistance,total\n            costs,training courses,veterinary services"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF037002-CROATIA - FARMER SUPPORT\n            SERVICES PROJECT,TF034985-ECA REGION - IRRIGATION,TF034569-CROATIA -FARMER SUPPORT SERVICES,TF029116-PHRD-PRIVATE FARMER SUPPOPRT SERVICES","repnb":"P6605"},"facets":{}}}
