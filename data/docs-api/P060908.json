Some lessons learned included:\n            the project's success has lain in its ability to\n            consolidate the work of technical groups, non-governmental\n            organizations (NGOs) and local producers who, over several\n            decades, have demonstrated the usefulness of agro-ecological\n            activities and use this evidence to promote reorientation of\n            public investment. Through training and organization,\n            development and conservation can be harmonized if we learn\n            from local groups' experience and build bridges with\n            public officials. In order to achieve community-based\n            agreements for conservation in the corridors, the Mexico\n            Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MMBC) worked with ejidos\n            and communities (with the consent of their assemblies). The\n            process of designing, implementing, and enforcing a set of\n            rules to conserve public goods in the corridors is\n            equivalent establishing a local collective good in the\n            community. In Chiapas, prolonged consultation processes\n            ultimately led to a greater buy-in and demand for\n            subprojects and thus increased investments in the area.\n            Investments in strengthening institutional and local social\n            capital (NGOs and producers) contributed to the\n            project's monitoring network. Investing in\n            institutional partners also contributed to cost-sharing for\n            the more intricate/extensive/expensive monitoring\n            activities: the project helped to establish long-term\n            alliances with regional and mid-level organizations that\n            collaborated on monitoring responsibilities and activities.\n            These organizations will also contribute in future\n            activities to develop regional markets for MMBC sustainable\n            products. The intersectoral nature of CONABIO (National\n            Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity -\n            Comision Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la\n            Biodiversidad) made it possible for the MMBC to play a role\n            in facilitating the reorientation of public spending and as\n            a mediator in the promotion of municipal development plans.\n            When dealing with challenges that require intersectoral\n            collaboration, the project design should involve public\n            institutions which have an intersectoral mandate in order to\n            facilitate the cross sector efforts required by environment,\n            climate change, and social issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Mesoamerican Biological

This environmental assessment (EA) reviews the legal\n            framework on indigenous rights, which articulates social\n            promotion, and guaranteed access to justice, particularly\n            addressing their legal practices, and customs on land\n            ownership, and tenure rights. The EA examines the cultural\n            diversity, and socioeconomic profiles in the area, drawing\n            strategic lines based on consultations with indigenous\n            communities, and on institutional capacity to execute\n            environmental planning. Mitigation measures will be staged\n            between the years 2001-2004 as follows. Organizational\n            capacity will be strengthened, by sharing experiences,\n            preparing communal technical tables for management, and\n            administrative practices within participatory approaches.\n            Sustainable production, and conservation will be promoted\n            through training on agro-ecology, forestry management, and\n            organic production, aiming at stabilizing, promoting, and\n            marketing basic production.
