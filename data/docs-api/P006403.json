Although the project was completed with a\n            substantial delay, its two main objectives were achieved as\n            expected at appraisal. Future operations of the project are\n            financially and institutionally sustainable, but their\n            sustainability could be strengthened through some on-going\n            and follow up projects. Because of the lack of adequate\n            project monitoring and evaluation indicators and the absence\n            of a systematic information system at the federal level, a\n            full assessment of project outcomes cannot be done at this\n            moment. Key lessons learned included: a) Projects with a\n            long implementation period are not advisable during a\n            transitional period. b) It is essential to learn lessons\n            from the implementation experience of the precedent project,\n            especially for a repeat project. c) In a multi-state\n            project, if a sector loan approach cannot be adopted, the\n            project design should be kept flexible, and should be\n            adapted constantly to the changing needs. d) In a\n            multi-state project, introduction of competition and\n            incentives among states in the allocation of loan funds is\n            effective as long as their varying institutional capacities\n            are compensated by intensive technical assistance by the\n            federal government. e) A sub-account should be established\n            for each state separately so that each state's\n            accountability and performance efficiency would improve. f)\n            The Bank should streamline and actively monitor the process\n            for the amendment to loan agreements so that project design\n            can be adapted constantly and easily. g) Project specific\n            monitoring and evaluation system is not likely to be\n            operated effectively when an institution-wide monitoring and\n            evaluation system is lacking. h) Government's\n            commitment and P'CU's authorities and status are\n            highly correlated to the success of project implementation\n            and outcomes. i) A Borrower's ICR should be prepared\n            before the closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Northeast Basic Health\n            Service
