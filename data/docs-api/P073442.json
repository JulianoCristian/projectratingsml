Some lessons learned included: in fragile\n            and post-conflict countries, as was the case in\n            Guinea-Bissau, project objectives and design need to be as\n            simple and modest as possible. A multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS\n            project, especially in an environment of weak capacity,\n            should target sectors and population segments with the\n            largest potential impact. Although awareness raising and\n            sensitization of the population are welcome, given limited\n            resources and institutional capacity, a better strategy will\n            be to focus mitigation and communication efforts on\n            population groups that are most vulnerable and that play a\n            greater role in spreading HIV/AIDS. An adequate baseline and\n            functioning monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system are\n            essential in projects that are piloting new approaches, such\n            as the first round of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program\n            (MAP) interventions. Although development of the M&E\n            system was planned during implementation, it suffered\n            delays, remains weak and is still lacking an appropriate\n            baseline. While some of the problems were unforeseen (health\n            of the consultant, weak and delayed support from United\n            Nation (UN) partners), corrective actions and alternatives\n            need to be considered and prioritized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea Bissau - HIV/AIDS Global Mitigation\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea Bissau - HIV/AIDS

To this end, a regulatory management\n            should be in place at health facilities, accompanied by the\n            necessary budgetary resources to finance waste management,\n            and support, and promote the use of recycled materials.\n            Medical and hospital personnel, as well as private health\n            operators, should be trained in waste management, while\n            extensive sensitization, promotion, and public campaigns\n            should inform populations on the risks associated with the\n            non-compliance with waste management practices. Training\n            programs, and strategies for sanitary collection operations\n            should be made available, which should include the necessary\n            transportation modes, and appropriate residues treatment\n            systems, and processes for final disposal. It may include\n            microwave, incineration, chemical disinfection, and disposal\n            at landfills (following appropriate site selection), as each\n            case may require."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - HIV/AIDS Global Mitigation\n            Support Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea-Bissau - HIV/AIDS Global\n            Mitigation Support Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/03/2972292/guinea-bissau-hivaids-global-mitigation-support-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"GW-Hiv/Aids Global Mitigation Support\n            Project -- P073442","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Guinea-Bissau","authors":{"authr":"Mbaye Mbengue Faye, Consultant"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040227160446"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Health","lang":"Portuguese","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Institutional\n            framework; Legal & regulatory framework; Waste\n            management; Medical wastes; Biomedical materials; HIV\n            viruses; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; Training\n            programs; Health care facilities; Hospital personnel;\n            Sanitation education; Budgetary resources; Public awareness;\n            Campaign strategies; Recycled materials; Private health\n            care; Health providers; Microwave equipment; Incineration;\n            Disinfection; Chemical decontamination; Landfills;"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 4 (AFTS4)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026788-PHRD-GUINEA BISSAU: HIV/AIDS\n            GLOBAL MITIGATION SUPPORT PROJECT","repnb":"E859"},"facets":{}}}
