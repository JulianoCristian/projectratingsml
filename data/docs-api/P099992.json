Lessons learned\n            from this project are that coordination among different\n            government agencies was a problem in most of the project\n            cities. The design of the project development plan added\n            challenges in tracking its achievement. For future projects,\n            the project design and contract packaging should be\n            enhanced, so that serious revisions are avoided during\n            implementation. It had a prompt start due to the use of\n            retroactive financing. The project implementation\n            experienced a number of setbacks and adjustments. Then there\n            was the idea that supervision should also be enhanced,\n            especially in the early stages of project implementation.\n            Finally, in future similar projects, such public\n            consultations should be well designed and implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Liaoning Medium Cities\n            Infrastructure
