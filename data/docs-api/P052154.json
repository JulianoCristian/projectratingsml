Some lessons learned included: in projects\n            which involve public sector reform activities, such as\n            hospital restructuring, the importance of effective and far\n            reaching public information campaigns cannot be\n            underestimated. This is particularly critical before the\n            start of reform activities, in order to promote buy-in and\n            ownership of change activities. In this process, although\n            specific and targeted focus can rest on the stakeholders who\n            will be most affected by the change, an effort can also be\n            made to obtain buy-in from champions in key stakeholder\n            groups. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is essential in\n            order to track indicators and assess their performance. In\n            so doing, it will be possible to make necessary changes,\n            such as re-define indicator-targets in line with reality on\n            the ground, or modify indicators so that they are closely\n            linked with activities. In order for this process to take\n            place effectively, however, outcome and output indicators\n            must be tightly constructed and linked with both baseline\n            and target data. In addition, it is also very important that\n            due cognizance is taken of the information system that\n            underlies the M&E framework. Finally, supervision\n            missions must take their responsibility to monitor and\n            report back on progress toward attaining agreed indicators\n            during the life of a project very seriously."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Structural Reform Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Structural Reform\n            Support

The program provides support to the key reform\n            measures included in the Third Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (SAC 3) (report number P7316) and Energy Sector Adjustment\n            Credit (ESAC). The project has four main components. The\n            first component supports the establishment of a revolving\n            hospital restructuring fund, whereby the proceeds from the\n            sale of excess hospitals will be reinvested in the public\n            sector health system. The second component addresses private\n            sector development and the financial sector: it supports the\n            open, competitive, and strategic privatization of a few\n            large infrastructure enterprises by financing financial,\n            legal, and technical advisory services; strengthens the\n            capacity of the energy and infrastructure regulatory\n            institutions to enable strong private sector participation;\n            and strengthens the supervision department and monetary\n            policy capacity of the national bank. The third component\n            strengthens budget management, builds the institutional\n            capacity of the finance ministry, improves the license\n            regime, and supports the program of public information and\n            public relations on economic reforms. The fourth component\n            helps establish a credible and affordable safety net which\n            includes pension reform as well as targeted assistance to\n            the
