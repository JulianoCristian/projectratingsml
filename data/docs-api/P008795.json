This requires early\n            attention to measures aimed at building supportive laws and\n            organizations that improve market responses to reform. 3)\n            Generating early, positive results also requires rapid,\n            efficient implementation. 4) The Ministry of Agriculture and\n            Food saw this project as all pain and no gain. Adjustment\n            loans bring foreign exchange to the Ministry of Finance, but\n            typically bring little in the way of tangible support to\n            line ministries. 5) The Romania Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project, at $350 million, was too large. The\n            loan was excessive in relation to the conditions and to the\n            economic importance of the agriculture sector. It induced a\n            strong effort to obtain tranche release without any\n            compensating increase in genuine commitment to reform\n            through a steady and sustained effort."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Agricultural Sector Adjustment\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Agricultural Sector\n            Adjustment Loan
