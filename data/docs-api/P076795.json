The project will use a two pronged strategy:\n            targeting interventions at high risk groups, and\n            implementing non-targeted activities for the general\n            population. The first component, Community and Civil Society\n            Initiatives - will finance HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and\n            support activities of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)\n            including, Non-Governmental organizations (NGOs),\n            faith-based organizations (FBOs), community-based\n            organizations (CBOs), women's organizations,\n            professional organizations, trade unions, and private sector\n            organizations. The types of HIV/AIDS activities to be\n            supported will be demand driven, dependent on the proposals\n            presented by the respective CSOs. Activities eligible for\n            support include delivery of community based HIV/AIDS\n            information, education and communications behavior change\n            communication, condom distribution and/or social marketing,\n            home based care, community advocacy to reduce HIVIAIDS\n            stigma and discrimination, support activities for orphans\n            and widows/widowers of HIV/AIDS, as well as support for\n            people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS, which includes\n            income-generating activities, and, targeted activities for\n            HIV/AIDS vulnerable groups. The second component, will\n            support the response to HIV/AIDS by non-health sector line\n            ministries, namely, basic cross-cutting HIV/AIDS activities\n            which all ministries are expected to implement under their\n            respective sectoral HIV/AIDS programs. These include:\n            development and implementation of workplace HIV/AIDS\n            policies, promotion and advocacy to reduce HIV/AIDS stigma,\n            and discrimination, and establishment of a support group for\n            HIV/AIDS patients and families. The third component will\n            strengthen the Ministry of Health capacity in providing\n            technical guidance for the national response to HIVIAIDS,\n            specifically it will strengthen HIV/AIDS related services\n            for prevention, treatment, and care delivered through the\n            health care system. Finally, the fourth component will help\n            build the institutional capacity for scaling up\n            responsiveness, by financing technical advisory services,\n            training, staffing, equipment, goods, and general operating\n            costs. It includes institutional capacity, surveillance,\n            monitoring and evaluation activities, and the establishment\n            of a Legal Framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia - HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"St. Lucia - HIV/AIDS Prevention\n            and Control Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4326144/st-lucia-hivaids-prevention-control-project","projn":"LC-St. Lucia Hiv/Aids Prevention &\n            Control -- P076795","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Adolescent Health,Health Economics & Finance,Pharmaceuticals & Pharmacoeconomics,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"St. Lucia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040617132504"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,advisory committees,annual\n            report,annual work plans,Antenatal Care,behavior change,care\n            services,commercial sex,commercial sex workers,competitive\n            environment,condom distribution,condoms,Contracting out,data\n            collection,delinquents,disasters,discrimination,distribution\n            of condoms,Drugs,Epidemiology,Exchange Rate,families,health\n            care,health care workers,health policy,Health\n            Sector,high-risk,Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome,income,infections,information systems,laboratory\n            services,Learning,mass media,medical\n            supplies,medicines,Mother-to-Child\n            Transmission,mothers,national health,Non-Governmental\n            organizations,nurses,nutritional\n            support,pandemic,patients,pharmaceuticals,physicians,prevention\n            of mother,private sector,PROCUREMENT,professional\n            organizations,programs,project implementation,public\n            health,public services,quality of life,radio,risk\n            groups,safety,screening,sex,sex with men,sex workers,sexual\n            practices,social marketing,STDs,street vendors,Technical\n            Assistance,television,victims,vulnerable groups,waste,workplace,youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,advisory committees,annual\n            report,annual work plans,Antenatal Care,behavior change,care\n            services,commercial sex,commercial sex workers,competitive\n            environment,condom distribution,condoms,Contracting out,data\n            collection,delinquents,disasters,discrimination,distribution\n            of condoms,Drugs,Epidemiology,Exchange Rate,families,health\n            care,health care workers,health policy,Health\n            Sector,high-risk,Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome,income,infections,information systems,laboratory\n            services,Learning,mass media,medical\n            supplies,medicines,Mother-to-Child\n            Transmission,mothers,national health,Non-Governmental\n            organizations,nurses,nutritional\n            support,pandemic,patients,pharmaceuticals,physicians,prevention\n            of mother,private sector,PROCUREMENT,professional\n            organizations,programs,project implementation,public\n            health,public services,quality of life,radio,risk\n            groups,safety,screening,sex,sex with men,sex workers,sexual\n            practices,social marketing,STDs,street vendors,Technical\n            Assistance,television,victims,vulnerable groups,waste,workplace,youth"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"trustfund":"TF026636-PHRD-ST.
