The audit\n            agrees with the analysis and findings of the PCR and adds\n            comments on project generation. The project has been\n            successfully implemented with the exception of the following\n            changes: (a) the transfer of the College of Commerce to the\n            Second Education Project; (b) the deletion of the 30\n            agricultural education centers and their construction\n            outside of the project; (c) the substitution of eight new\n            comprehensive schools in place of seven of those which had\n            been included in the project as approved; and (d) non-use of\n            the technical assistance provided for educational facility\n            planning. These changes reflected the need for more advanced\n            project preparation involving discussion with local\n            authorities during the project generation stage. However,\n            project objectives remained intact. Physical implementation\n            was generally well attended to. The project's community\n            schools are operating with average efficiency within Ireland\n            and are making proportional contributions to the labor\n            market and to the supply of students for higher education\n            institutions. Other highlights of this report include: (a)\n            the use of architectural design competition to select school\n            designs; (b) the progressive refinement of school building\n            and furniture designs; (c) some flaws in school design and\n            construction regarding thermal insulation, roofing, and\n            sub-floor drainage; (d) the over-supply of teachers in the\n            schools by comparison with appraisal estimates; (e) the\n            strategy of using smaller class sizes and a larger number of\n            class groups than envisaged at appraisal; (f) the very\n            strong community participation and support; (g) the\n            enrollment in community schools reflecting the\n            socio-economic composition of their catchment areas; (h) and\n            the good performance of the Department of Education's\n            Project Unit in portions falling within that Department, but\n            its ineffectiveness in coping with portions falling within\n            the Department of Agriculture."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ireland - Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ireland - Education
