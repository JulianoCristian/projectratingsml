The loan disbursed only\n            the front-end fee (US$0.025 million) and was cancelled on\n            May 3, 2012 at the request of the client. At the loan\n            cancellation, progress towards the development objective was\n            rated unsatisfactory while the implementation progress was\n            moderately unsatisfactory. In sum, there were essentially\n            three main issues that contributed to the implementation\n            delays and eventually to the cancellation of the project.\n            Firstly, it took eight months from the approval of the\n            project in April 2009 to sign the contract among the\n            counterparts in Mexico. Secondly, the project needed to be\n            restructured during 2010 because of budget constraints.\n            Thirdly, exceptions and modifications to the harmonized\n            procurement documents, including the contract model further\n            delayed the procurement process on both the Bank and the\n            Government of Mexico (GOM) side. After the Board approval in\n            April 2009, a project launch event, which included training\n            to officials on the Bank's procurement processes, was\n            organized in July 2009. However, after approval, the project\n            experienced an effectiveness delay of 11 months."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Customs Institutional Strengthening

Institutional Strengthening Project is to improve the\n            efficiency of customs processes thus contributing to\n            improving Mexico's competitiveness and facilitating\n            trade with foreign parties. There are four components to the\n            project. The first component of the project is institutional\n            redesign. This component seeks to correct the structural\n            impediments to increasing the efficiency of the customs\n            cycle, through a redefinition and redesign of the services\n            and processes which support customs operations. The second\n            component of the project is human capital. This component is\n            geared towards increasing the professionalism and capacities\n            of the general administration for customs' managers and\n            staff. The third component of the project is change\n            management. This component is aimed at communicating the\n            changes to internal and external stakeholders, ensuring the\n            understanding of these changes and the involvement and\n            engagement with the project of said stakeholders. The fourth\n            component of the project is project administration and\n            management. This component aims to ensure an effective\n            coordination of the efforts to define, develop and implement\n            the project, to accomplish its stated objectives on time and\n
