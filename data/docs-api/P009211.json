The project is not rated and\n            will not be audited. Differences arose between the Bank and\n            the Borrower regarding project composition and scope,\n            implementation capacity, and availability of local cost\n            financing. In terms of scope, the local implementing agency\n            proposed at appraisal a project comprising only select\n            components which, in the Bank's view, would affect the\n            viability of individual investments. In terms of\n            implementation capacity, the implementing agency had\n            insisted on providing comparable investment packages to all\n            local level work organizations despite their technical or\n            managerial capacity, while the Bank felt that the project\n            should concentrate on organizations with a greater capacity.\n            In terms of local cost financing, the implementing agency\n            had assured the Bank that local financing would be\n            available, but the Borrower indicated that funds were\n            sufficient to cover only one third of the local costs. The\n            differences were argued throughout the protracted project\n            preparation period. This period of over five years saw an\n            overall deterioration in Yugoslavia's economy and in\n            its relationship with the Bank. After negotiations led to\n            some agreements between the Bank and the Borrower in\n            December 1985, new laws were enacted in early 1986 on the\n            assumption of foreign exchange risk which created\n            uncertainty on the part of the project's investors.\n            Despite attempts by the bank to find a solution, no response\n            was forthcoming and the Bank withdrew the loan offer on July\n            31, 1986."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Bosnia-Herzegovina Forestry\n            Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Bosnia-Herzegovina\n            Forestry Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/03/734665/yugoslavia-bosnia-herzegovina-forestry-improvement-project","projn":"Forestry-Bosnia -- P009211","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Forestry","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925211312"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Borrower,COAL,exchange\n            rate,forest,forest harvesting,forest production,forest\n            roads,Forestry,forestry development,forestry\n            institutions,forests,Guarantor,imports,LOAN,Loan\n            Amount,local\n            financing,logging,onlending,packages,particleboard,productivity,pulp,pulpwood,sawmills,subborrowers,tree\n            nurseries,wood,wood processing,wood production"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Borrower,COAL,exchange\n            rate,forest,forest harvesting,forest production,forest\n            roads,Forestry,forestry development,forestry\n            institutions,forests,Guarantor,imports,LOAN,Loan\n            Amount,local\n            financing,logging,onlending,packages,particleboard,productivity,pulp,pulpwood,sawmills,subborrowers,tree\n            nurseries,wood,wood processing,wood production"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","repnb":"11713"},"740035":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/05/740035/yugoslavia-bosnia-herzegovina-forestry-improvement-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/05/740035/yugoslavia-bosnia-herzegovina-forestry-improvement-project","new_url":"1985/05/740035/yugoslavia-bosnia-herzegovina-forestry-improvement-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/05/01/000009265_3970625094742/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/05/01/000009265_3970625094742/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2568","docdt":"1985-05-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Bosnia-Herzegovina Forestry\n            Improvement Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Bosnia Herzogovina Forestry Project\n            will improve the Republic's institutional and policy\n            framework in forestry through a more rational investment\n            allocation, and improved organizational and financial\n            management within PBS and the forestry institutions.
