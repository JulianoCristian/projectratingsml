Bank-supported\n            project activities can catalyze key sector reforms through\n            close engagement and effective dialogue in general, as well\n            as during project preparation. Within the context of\n            supporting a long-term substantive sector reform,\n            responsiveness to short-term sector challenges are key for\n            sustaining project relevance. Broad and complex projects can\n            be successfully implemented in the context of timely and\n            quality implementation support from the Bank and a client\n            with high capacity. The monitoring and evaluation M&E\n            and the results framework should incorporate only those\n            indicators that can accurately measure the results achieved\n            through the project. Relevant, comprehensive and technically\n            well-designed studies should be planned as part of project\n            preparation to monitor and accurately measure project\n            outcomes. Successful implementation of the competitive\n            innovations fund (CIF) can be ensured through clearly\n            defined roles and responsibilities of the CIF recipients and\n            their timely and relevant capacity building.

The Request was\n            submitted by 9 NGOs, 2 students and 5 parents from Armenia.\n            The Panel notes that the issues raised by the Requesters are\n            serious, legitimate concerns of citizens about the content\n            and directions of reforms in education that is absolutely\n            critical to the future of Armenian children, and therefore\n            of Armenia.

and the Education Improvement Project ('EIP'). The\n            EQRP2 was approved by the World Bank Board of Executive\n            Directors (the 'Board') on May 12, 2009 for SDR\n            17.0 million IDA credit (equivalent ofUS$25.0 million) to\n            the Republic of Armenia with a closing date of November 30,\n            2014. It consists of three components, namely: 1) enhancing\n            the quality of general education; 2) supporting tertiary\n            education reforms in the context of Bologna agenda; and 3)\n            project management, monitoring and evaluation. The Ministry\n            of Education and Science will be responsible for the\n            implementation of the project supported by a Center for\n            Education Project (CEP) acting as the project implementing\n            unit. At the time the panel received the request for\n            inspection, about 72 percent of the credit had been\n            disbursed. The requesters state that 'any new\n            loan' will have to 'take into account the problems\n            with the previous loan program' and address those\n            issues. The requesters attached several case studies to\n            illustrate impact on students and parents who are among the requesters."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Second Education Quality and\n            Relevance Project and Education Improvement Project :\n            request for inspection"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Second Education\n            Quality and Relevance Project and Education Improvement\n            Project : request for inspection"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2014/06/19665247/armenia-second-education-quality-relevance-project-education-improvement-project-request-inspection","projn":"AM-Second Education Quality And Relevance\n            (Apl 2) -- P107772","subtopic":"Access & Equity in Basic Education,Tertiary Education,Gender and Education,Education For All,Primary Education","docty":"Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Armenia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20140613090655"},"theme":"Education for all,Education for the knowledge economy","subsc":"General education sector,Tertiary education,Public administration- Education,Pre-primary education","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic needs, curriculum, education agencies,\n            education sector, educational resources, gender equality,\n            gender roles, gender sensitivity, gender stereotypes,\n            general education, high school, high schools, Higher\n            Education, Higher Education Institutions, interventions,\n            learning, libraries, Management Framework, Ministry of\n            Education, primary education, professional development,\n            Quality Assurance, Quality Assurance systems, quality\n            education, Quality of Education, religious institutions,\n            religious minorities, rural areas, rural students, school\n            buildings, school learning, school readiness, school\n            selection, schools, secondary education, secondary schools,\n            state education, state universities, teachers, teaching,\n            tertiary education, tertiary education reforms, Tertiary\n            Education system, tertiary sector, textbooks, traditional\n            gender, university finances, urban areas, urban students,\n            vulnerable groups, youth"}},"owner":"Education (ECSH2)","Environmental Category":["C"],"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF011432-Sharing Experience on ICT Use\n            in Education: Implementation models for b,TF012402-READ Armenia","majtheme":"Human development","repnb":"88610"},"facets":{}}}
