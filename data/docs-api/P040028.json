An important lesson is that\n            addressing the redundancy issue upfront, and initiating a\n            well-designed staff retrenchment program, with adequate\n            social safeguards, negotiated with labor unions prior to\n            privatization, can be an effective instrument to minimize\n            the impacts of restructuring, and to reduce opposition to\n            such project. The process of privatization of Brazil's\n            railways could very well have derailed, and many employees\n            could have been brought into poverty without the attention\n            given to the issue by RFFSA management. Moreover, support\n            for a well-designed staff retrenchment program, equitable\n            severance payments, and retraining and outplacement efforts,\n            can substantially increase the credibility of such program,\n            greatly improving the feasibility of the entire\n            privatization project. This was the first Bank investment\n            project which directly helped finance severance payments,\n            where the risks identified at the time of project\n            preparation, did not actually materialize. Other lessons\n            convey the need for an established regulatory framework\n            prior to initiating a privatization program, as in this\n            case, a broader (geographical) restructuring of the public\n            railways would have been needed to allow for more efficient\n            private operations. Regrettably, the Government's\n            decision to proceed with privatization anyway, had mixed\n            results, for the privatization process was completed, but\n            the geographical restructuring of the concessions in the\n            Southeast region, remain to be simplified. Finally, while it\n            is clear that railway concession operations cannot resolve\n            all sector problems, government interventions however, may\n            still be justified, i.e., to ensure competitiveness of\n            railways, upgrading major rail corridors would allow for\n            competitive operating speeds, and, improve their\n            connectivity, particularly improving Brazil's\n            competitiveness in export markets. The investments required,\n            however, are well beyond the financial capacity of\n            concessionaires, but externalities involved, such as the\n            socio-economic and environmental costs of trucking in\n            congested urban areas, could very well justify the\n            participation of the Government in such investment programs,\n            through well-defined public-private partnership agreements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Federal Railways Restructuring and\n            Privatization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -

freight\n            transport in Brazil's main corridors by restructuring\n            and privatizing the federal railways. Specific objectives\n            are to: 1) improve performance by restructuring and\n            concessioning Rede Ferroviara Federal S.A.'s (RFFSA)\n            operations to private operators, and by restructuring its\n            finances to settle debts and labor liabilities; 2) increase\n            productivity through staff retrenchment and emergency\n            rehabilitation of critical assets in order to make the\n            proposed concessions viable, while minimizing the social\n            cost of staff retrenchment; and 3) enhance competition\n            through regulatory reform, with a view to increase the\n            railways market share and reduce freight transport rates.\n            The project will consist of the following six components: 1)\n            operations restructuring and concessioning component; 2)\n            staff retrenchment program; 3) emergency rehabilitation\n            program; 4) environmental management component; 5)\n            regulatory reform component; and 6) financial restructuring\n            and settlement component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Federal Railways Restructuring and\n            Privatization
