It assesses\n            the outcome, impact, and sustainability of the major\n            productive components of the two projects. From a\n            quantitative and qualitative viewpoint, it found the\n            projects' performance to be mixed. The ERRs (Economic\n            Rate for Return) for the productive components were\n            generally below the traditional cutoff point for a\n            satisfactory rating. In addition, the quality of the initial\n            rehabilitation works was poor and the subsequent O&M\n            (Operation and Maintenance) insufficient. The primary\n            problems behind the poor performance were: 1) overly\n            optimistic SAR targets; 2) over-attribution of production\n            increases to project actions; and 3) lack of beneficiary\n            involvement, poor supervision, and an absence of\n            transitional planning. Despite these shortcomings, some\n            success did emerge. First, paddy yields in the small\n            irrigation schemes rehabilitated under the projects proved\n            to be above average for the districts and had increased more\n            rapidly than in the country as a whole. Second, the\n            infrastructure projects provided significant benefits.\n            Lastly, the line agencies involved in implementing the\n            projects expanded their implementation capacity\n            considerably. Overall, the impact of the projects can be\n            considered marginally satisfactory."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Kurunegala and Second Rural\n            Development

However, implementation did not\n            progress as anticipated particularly in the initial period\n            and the project closing date was extended twice by one year\n            in order to achieve most of the set targets. The main reason\n            for the slow start-up was a fourteen-month delay in the\n            procurement of equipment and vehicles, which affected staff\n            mobility and execution of work. This was mostly due to the\n            inexperience of Agencies' staff with the Bank's\n            International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. The\n            other important reason for delay was a serious manpower\n            shortage in the main implementing agency, i.e., the\n            Department of Irrigation which slowed down identification of\n            tanks and design of rehabilitation work. Most of the project\n            implementation difficulties could have been avoided through\n            more detailed project preparation efforts. In particular,\n            more attention should have been given to the strengthening\n            of the Department of Irrigation and to ensuring better\n            inter-agency coordination. The fact that the officials of\n            the agencies involved in project implementation were not\n            familiar with ICB procedures should have been recognized and\n            technical

The\n            project will provide for rehabilitation of existing\n            irrigation schemes accompanied by improved water management\n            practices to fully exploit the irrigation potential, and for\n            programs for replanting/underplanting, intercropping and\n            fertilizing of smallholder coconut plantations. The project\n            will also strengthen agricultural extension services,\n            improve the supply of input services such as fertilizer\n            distribution and seeds supplies, and lay the foundation for\n            a viable agriculture credit system.
