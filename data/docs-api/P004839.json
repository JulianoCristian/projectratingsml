Some lessons learned included: 1) The project\n            design incorporated three critical lessons learned from\n            earlier Integrated Conservation Development Project (ICDPs);\n            they are the need to explicitly link conservation\n            commitments with development activities; the importance of\n            involving local communities (CAP process); and the need to\n            include the entire buffer zone rather than a few selected\n            communities to have a significant impact in halting\n            encroachment; 2) The project has demonstrated that by\n            linking and sequencing of conservation and development\n            activities, the local community was more committed to the\n            conservation goal; 3) Linking forest protection with rural\n            development is a more effective approach to protection of\n            critical forest areas than relying on enforcement alone; 4)\n            The use of the Commune Action Plan (CAPs) is a good example\n            of participatory planning and has assisted village- and\n            commune-level staff to comprehend their rights within a\n            \"bottom-up\" planning process; 5) With the project\n            design and implementation involving local community's\n            participation, decentralization and delegation of approval\n            to provincial level was critical to the success; and 6) For\n            ICDP projects engaging community's participation, there\n            should be more than one Midterm Review (MTR) and the first\n            MTR should be carried out in Year 2 to take stock, identify,\n            and address potential problems at early stages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Forest Protection and Rural\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Forest Protection and\n            Rural Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/03/7591746/vietnam-forest-protection-rural-development-project","projn":"VN-Forest Protection And Rural Development\n            -- P004839","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Ecosystems and Natural Habitats,Environmental Economics & Policies,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Wildlife Resources,Forestry","teratopic":"Rural Development,Environment","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070509115045"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plan, Action Plans, agricultural\n            extension, agricultural land, agricultural productivity,\n            agricultural use, Agriculture, agroforestry, arable land,\n            audits, awareness campaign, bio-diversity, Biodiversity,\n            biodiversity protection, biodiversity value, boundary,\n            buffer zone, buffer zones, Cat, cattle, Conservation,\n            conservation activities, Conservation Development Project,\n            conservation management, conservation objectives,\n            Conservation Project, crops, cultivation techniques,\n            cultural institutions, deforestation, degraded forest,\n            Development Projects, economic conditions, economic\n            Development, encroachment, Environmental, environmental\n            degradation, Environmental Impact, Environmental Impact\n            Assessment, Environmental Protection, equipment, Exchange\n            Rate, extension services, farmers, feasibility studies,\n            field activities, financial management, financial resources,\n            fishing, food insecurity, food production, food security,\n            FOREST, forest areas, forest cover, forest degradation,\n            forest fires, forest guard, forest land, forest laws, Forest\n            Management, forest products, FOREST PROTECTION, forest\n            sector, forest zone, forestry, forestry sector, Fox,\n            Highlands, illegal harvesting, income, incomes, intact\n            forests, Issues, Key Indicators, Land administration, Land\n            allocation, land tenure, Land Use, Land use plan, land-use,\n            land-use planning, livelihoods, livestock, local\n            authorities, migration, National Park, natural forests,\n            natural resource, natural resource base, Natural Resources,\n            Nature, Nature Reserve, new technologies, Park, patrolling,\n            planting, population density, population growth, population\n            pressure, poverty alleviation, provincial governments,\n            public awareness, reclamation, regeneration, Roads, RURAL\n            DEVELOPMENT, shifting cultivation, State Forest, State\n            Forest Enterprises, sustainable use, tourism, villages"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021604-FOREST PROTECTION & RURAL\n            DEVELOP.

More specifically, the main development\n            objectives are: 1) to effectively protect Cat Tien National\n            Park (CTNP) and to effectively protect and manage the Chu\n            Mom Ray Nature Reserve (CMRNR); 2) to effectively manage the\n            remaining natural forests outside the protected areas (PA)\n            but within the buffer zone of CTNP and CMRNR; 3) to reduce\n            dependency on CTNP and CMRNR for subsistence and cash\n            income; and  4) to strengthen capacity of the government to\n            effectively design, implement, and monitor ICDPs. To achieve\n            these objectives, three main components and their\n            subcomponents comprise the project. The Protected Area\n            Management for CMRNR Component provides for revising the\n            existing Management Plan for CMRNR in two phases; implements\n            the revised Management Plan including boundary demarcation,\n            introduces PA management programs, supports basic\n            infrastructure, and supplies basic equipment; implements\n            selected research studies and surveys; formulates and\n            implements a public awareness campaign in the CMRNR;\n            develops programs to encourage and manage nature tourism in\n            the PA and buffer zone; and trains PA staff to run the\n            intensified conservation management and visitor programs.\n            The Buffer Zone Development Component has six subcomponents:\n            community development planning, land allocation involving\n            land use planning at the commune level and helping to\n            prepare cadastre maps and the issuance of land use\n            certificates; social support in the form of \"food\n            security,\" basic infrastructure and activities to\n            strengthen local social and cultural institutions;\n            agricultural support services (extension, technology\n            transfer, and public awareness); forest protection and\n            management; and rural infrastructure improvement, including\n            expanding irrigation systems, upgrading roads, and improving\n            road access. The third component, Project Management and\n            Institutional Development, includes strengthening\n            institutional capacity at all levels to implement project\n            activities and sustain project interventions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Forest Protection and Rural\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Forest
