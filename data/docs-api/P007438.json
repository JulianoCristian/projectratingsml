There were some\n            positive achievements in the institutional strengthening of\n            the Ministry of Construction (Works) specifically with\n            respect to staffing, streamlining of project training,\n            traffic management, and some civil works. But success was\n            uneven because of the borrower's focus on maintenance\n            works and equipment purchase with traffic management\n            measures often delayed or ultimately scrapped. The project\n            experienced a number of significant delays. One of the main\n            reasons for this was the lack of counterpart funding.\n            Because some of the Bank's project components were seen\n            as less important than those of other externally funded\n            projects, they were deferred for lack of sufficient funds.\n            Generally the bank performed well throughout the project\n            cycle, providing a high level of input during the critical\n            implementation stages and keeping staff changes to a\n            minimum. The Borrower also performed well generally during\n            project implementation, particularly with respect to civil\n            works. The main issue of adequate and timely provision of\n            counterpart funds was out of the Ministry's control.\n            There were three key lessons learned. First, a sectoral\n            perspective in transport is essential to avoid distortions\n            within the sector and ensure an appropriate level of\n            government budgetary support. Second, a strong and\n            responsive implementing/executing agency as well as strong\n            sectoral coordination among external financiers is very\n            important in realizing project success as is the Bank's\n            commitment to the sector. Third, simplicity in focus as well\n            as design reduces the need for complex coordination, and\n            allows the Bank and Borrower to more easily monitor implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Kingston Urban Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Kingston Urban\n            Transport
