The project\n            covers the following five road sections scattered from the\n            south to the north of the country: (i) a link to the new\n            port of Umm Qasr; (ii) the reconstruction of the only outlet\n            to the north of the port of Basrah; (iii) a new road\n            connecting the Euphrates and Tigris rivers through an\n            intensively cultivated area; (iv) the final link in the new\n            highway between Baghdad and the Kirkuk oilfields; and (v)\n            the last leg of the Baghdad-Mosul highway. In addition, a\n            bridge on the Euphrates will improve Iraq's\n            communications with the neighboring countries to the west\n            and with ports on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The\n            roads and bridge to be financed are substantially the same\n            ones as appraised in 1964 except for the deletion of two\n            road sections and the substitution of a new one following\n            the 1965 re-appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iraq - Road Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iraq - Road Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1964/09/1554482/iraq-road-project","projn":"IQ-Road-269201 -- P005232","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Urban Transport,Municipal Housing and Land,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Land and Real Estate Development","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Iraq","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903474917"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","colti":"Technical operations projects series ; no.\n            TO 421","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access road,Airways,asphalt,Average Daily\n            Traffic,bidding,bottleneck,bridge,Bridge\n            construction,Bridges,buses,carriageway,cars,Cement,Civil\n            Aviation,commercial\n            vehicles,congestion,Construction,construction\n            materials,construction works,Control of Vehicle,customs\n            duties,Daily Traffic,diesel\n            fuel,drainage,drivers,Driving,Driving Licenses,earth\n            roads,Freight,fuel,fuel taxes,Grade,gravel,gravel\n            roads,heavy traffic,highway,highways,income,international\n            trade,journey,Limestone,local contractors,main\n            roads,maintenance operation,major highways,modes of\n            transport,motor vehicles,passengers,paved roads,periodic\n            maintenance,piers,pile,points,prestressed concrete,railway\n            traffic,Railways,range,resurfacing,river,road access,Road\n            construction,road costs,Road Financing,road improvement,road\n            investments,road maintenance,road network,Road planning,road\n            sector,Road Transport,Road Transport Sector,road\n            users,Roads,rough,route,routes,routine\n            maintenance,safety,Speed,square,steel,taxis,timber,tires,Traffic,traffic\n            counters,traffic counting,traffic growth,traffic\n            projections,Transportation,trucking,trucks,trunk\n            road,Vehicle Loads,vehicle registration,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"access road,Airways,asphalt,Average Daily\n            Traffic,bidding,bottleneck,bridge,Bridge\n            construction,Bridges,buses,carriageway,cars,Cement,Civil\n            Aviation,commercial\n            vehicles,congestion,Construction,construction\n            materials,construction works,Control of Vehicle,customs\n            duties,Daily Traffic,diesel\n            fuel,drainage,drivers,Driving,Driving Licenses,earth\n            roads,Freight,fuel,fuel taxes,Grade,gravel,gravel\n            roads,heavy traffic,highway,highways,income,international\n            trade,journey,Limestone,local contractors,main\n            roads,maintenance operation,major highways,modes of\n            transport,motor vehicles,passengers,paved roads,periodic\n            maintenance,piers,pile,points,prestressed concrete,railway\n            traffic,Railways,range,resurfacing,river,road access,Road\n            construction,road costs,Road Financing,road improvement,road\n            investments,road maintenance,road network,Road planning,road\n            sector,Road Transport,Road Transport Sector,road\n            users,Roads,rough,route,routes,routine\n            maintenance,safety,Speed,square,steel,taxis,timber,tires,Traffic,traffic\n            counters,traffic counting,traffic growth,traffic\n            projections,Transportation,trucking,trucks,trunk\n            road,Vehicle Loads,vehicle registration,vehicles"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"TO421"},"facets":{}}}
