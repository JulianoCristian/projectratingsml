Instead of growing wheat or barley,\n            thousands of the country's small farmers have been\n            planting crops that need more water but ultimately yield\n            more cash. The transformation comes thanks to investments\n            supported by the World Bank over many years in the\n            country's irrigation and water rights systems.\n            Investments have also been made in building new, gravity-fed\n            irrigation systems that do not need pumps and save a lot of\n            money on fuel, almost $ 35 million. As the global financial\n            crisis hit, the World Bank invested emergency funds for\n            renovation of around 90 km of sections of the main Armavir\n            and Talin, helping to create 12,000 temporary jobs. As a\n            result, water losses in two important main canals have\n            reduced from almost 23 percent to 7 percent. That allows\n            7,000 more hectares to be irrigated. A follow-up project has\n            already been topped up so that more canals in six provinces\n            can be repaired, encouraging further agricultural\n            development and the possibility of increased incomes for\n            Armenia's farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The new landscape of Armenia's agriculture"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"The new landscape of\n            Armenia's agriculture"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/05/24428494/new-landscape-armenias-agriculture","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water users associations, pumping,\n            water management, irrigation systems, water projects, water\n            needs, irrigation, wua, water user, transparency, irrigation\n            networks, meters, orchards, water users, water resource\n            management, irrigation rehabilitation, dams, irrigation\n            infrastructure, pumps, access to irrigation, agricultural\n            development, water, canals, programs, water resource,\n            irrigation development, reservoirs, water fees, irrigation\n            water, farmers, irrigation canals, water losses, bilateral\n            agreement, pumping stations, water rights, gravity, artesian wells"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","projn":"AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency\n            Project -- P116681,AM-Additional Financing To Irep -- P126509,AM-Irrigation Development Additional\n            Financing -- P105171,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety 2 Project -- P088499,AM-Irrigation Development Project -- P055022,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277","topic":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Water Use,Irrigation and Drainage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b082e1d99d_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management,Rural policies and institutions,Other social protection and risk management,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF025793-PHRD-IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT,BBFAO-BB FAO,TF029549-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT\n            SERVICES PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF036016-ECA REGION - WATER AND\n            AGRICULTURE (ARMENIA, UZBEKISTAN),BBFAO-BB FAO,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.

Some lessons learned included: the IDP\n            experience with the irrigation and drainage (I&D) sector\n            in Armenia shows that deep reforms work well when there is\n            strong commitment to reform overtime. As was in the case of\n            Mexico, IDP successfully used financing of rehabilitation\n            works as a bargaining tool to promote transfers that were\n            not very economically attractive to users given the\n            dilapidated state of the systems and the chronic lack of\n            funds for operation and maintenance (O&M). Institutional\n            arrangements giving more responsibility and say to farmers,\n            engage the energy of the private sector, and reduce\n            governments role. Emphasis on decentralization, financial\n            viability and accountability of water services providers,\n            empowerment through rights and responsibilities of water\n            users and their organizations, always result in higher\n            impact of I&D rehabilitation investments, sustainable\n            transformations and dynamism. Stakeholders active\n            participation in the I&D investments and sector reform\n            processes, and building capacity (organizational and\n            managerial skills, and databases) in agricultural water\n            projects has demonstrated, once again, that it derives in\n            more satisfactory results. Where market absorption exists,\n            expansion and productivity increases through improvements of\n            agricultural water management can strongly contribute to\n            poverty

Development Additional Financing for Armenia is to enhance\n            the profitability and sustainability of irrigated\n            agriculture through: (i) completing priority irrigation\n            works to minimize water losses, (ii) lowering the overall\n            energy costs through converting pumping systems to gravity\n            systems, and (iii) restructuring and strengthening the\n            irrigation institutions. The rehabilitation grant scheme\n            under the institutional development component of the\n            irrigation development project (IDP) financed about US$7.2\n            million for rehabilitation of tertiary canals under Water\n            Users Associations (WUAs\u0092) management. Eighty-five percent\n            of this amount was financed with the credit proceeds while\n            15 percent was financed by the WUAs as counterpart funding.\n            Rural communities worth an additional US$9 million could not\n            be funded due to a lack of resources. The additional\n            financing would partially cover this surplus demand with\n            about US$5.4 million for the grant scheme. The additional\n            financing would also support the annual audit of the WUAs\n            (about US$0.3 million) and technical design and some limited\n            training activities for WUAs (US$O. 15 million).The major\n            changes of this project are follows: supported activities\n            and the project development objective (PDO). The additional\n            financing aims at scaling up activities of the institutional\n            development component of the on-going irrigation development\n            project. It would mainly expand support to rehabilitation of\n            the tertiary irrigation system with co-financing from WUAs.\n            This will help to: (i) minimize water losses at the tertiary\n            level, where they are the highest; and (ii) improve\n            institutional capacity at the grassroots level and establish\n            a reliable funding mechanism that will prevent future\n            deterioration of the water conveyance infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia -

If it is not watered on\n            time - and 10 to 12 times until the autumn harvest - its\n            apples remain small and fall to ground without ever\n            ripening. This is a lesson Armenian farmers learned the hard\n            way when the country\u0092s irrigation system disintegrated under\n            the weight of management chaos and physical neglect\n            following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Erratic water\n            supplies and decrepit canals threatened the livelihoods not\n            only of apple growers but farmers all over the country: 80\n            percent of Armenia\u0092s agricultural output comes from\n            irrigated land. When their orchards died, some farmers in\n            the Ararat valley, the country\u0092s rich-soiled agricultural\n            food basket, were forced to switch to wheat, a less valuable\n            crop which can make do with rain. So today, when orchards\n            are making a come-back, those who revived Armenia\u0092s\n            irrigation system are justifiably proud. Each new sapling is\n            a sign of farmers\u0092 trust that renovated water canals and\n            well-managed water users\u0092 associations will keep the apple\n            business alive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Water on demand helps farmers\n            expand their orchards"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Water on demand helps\n            farmers expand their orchards"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/23979784/armenia-water-demand-helps-farmers-expand-orchards","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Information and communications,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to irrigation, agricultural output,\n            canals, Cost recovery, covering, cut off, drip irrigation,\n            farmer, Farmers, food basket, irrigation, Irrigation\n            Development, management of water, Orchards, rain,\n            transparency, Water Association, water associations, Water\n            Reservoirs, water sector, water sector development, water\n            supplies, water users, Water Users Associations"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social protection and risk management","projn":"AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879,AM-Irrigation Development Project -- P055022,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety 2 Project -- P088499","topic":"Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Governance m1327255 831,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Supply m1326961 138","subtopic":"Water Supply and Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Rural Poverty Reduction","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction,Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150210103946"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Law and justice,Water supply,Other social services,Telecommunications,Roads and highways,Irrigation and drainage,Central government administration","theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Rural policies and institutions,Participation and civic engagement,Other social protection and risk management,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Natural disaster management","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction,Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Governance m1327255 831,Poverty Measurement and Analysis m1326941 707,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Supply m1326961 138","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF032000-ARMENNIA - IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.
