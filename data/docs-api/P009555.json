Institutional development is  rated modest.\n            Sustainability is  rated likely, because commitment to\n            increasing enrollment and gender equity remains strong in\n            Bangladesh. Borrower performance is  rated satisfactory\n            because, despite problems, the government made a great\n            effort and implemented the project. Bank performance is\n            also rated satisfactory, particularly because of the\n            project's innovative design. Experience with the\n            project confirms a number of OED lessons from education\n            projects: 1)   The very poor may enroll children to school\n            in response to food or money. However, parents may do the\n            minimum necessary to get the desired benefit and not\n            necessarily encourage children's attendance. Incentives\n            must be tied to attendance, study, and passing of\n            examinations. 2) Enrollment in school, although important,\n            does not automatically bring about education and information\n            acquisition. Access to education of l o w quality has\n            dubious benefits. Given systemic difficulties, governments\n            and donors must provide the very poor with the means to help\n            them attend classes regularly and learn the required\n            material. 3) People may modify social customs for earnings\n            and status, particularly if these customs have drawbacks.\n            Award of stipends or possibly even simple cash transfers to\n            families may be useful in postponing marriages for girls who\n            did not attend or finish primary school, perhaps in the form\n            of stipends for vocational training. 4) Significant amounts\n            of overstated data in a database may make it hard to assess\n            project effects. Decisions based on incorrect data may not\n            help intended beneficiaries. Projects should aim at\n            establishing realistic parameters and criteria for inclusion\n            in various programs in order to have greater data accuracy.\n            5) 0 Programs that have much social appeal may receive\n            political support and be more sustainable. Thus, political\n            support is  important.

Lessons stemming from\n            preparation address the seemingly, underestimated social\n            response to the project, which should have been reviewed\n            early on during preparation, to include a social assessment,\n            incorporated in project design, also at an early stage.\n            Although well prepared, the female education awareness\n            program, lacked local knowledge and specific ground\n            realities, which could be emphasized be it through the\n            media, theater, and/or local literary practices.\n            Implementation lessons indicate that many potential benefits\n            of projects - management skills, increased access to data -\n            are lost at project closing, if not integrated into the\n            operational system of existing institutions. In this\n            instance, the implementation record stands out as excellent.\n            However, since the project staff was recruited from outside,\n            or on secondment from other institutions, there is a risk\n            that gains may be lost; thus an effective integration of\n            achievements into the Directorate of Secondary and Higher\n            Education should be addressed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Female Secondary School\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Female Secondary\n            School Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/05/1806047/bangladesh-female-secondary-school-assistance-project","projn":"BD-Female Secondary School Assistance -- P009555","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Girls Education","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02061709155762"},"subsc":"Secondary education,Vocational training,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Other social services,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,Achievements,active\n            participation,additional resources,attending\n            school,community involvement,community\n            participation,Development Program,dropout rates,educating\n            girls,educational achievement,effective\n            participation,employment,enrollment,families,Female\n            Education,female enrollment,female graduates,female\n            participation,female students,female teachers,financial\n            resources,girls,hygiene,Institutional\n            Development,intervention,interventions,labor\n            market,leadership,level of education,local communities,mass\n            media,Mathematics,Mid-Term Review,motivation,Orientation\n            Courses,papers,parents,Posters,primary education,primary\n            schools,public awareness,quality of education,school\n            enrollments,School Management,School Management\n            Committees,school performance,schooling,schools,Secondary\n            Education,secondary enrollment,secondary level,secondary\n            schools,siblings,skills training,social development,Social\n            Policy,stipends,student\n            enrollment,Teacher,teachers,trainees,tuition fees,women teachers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,Achievements,active\n            participation,additional resources,attending\n            school,community involvement,community\n            participation,Development Program,dropout rates,educating\n            girls,educational achievement,effective\n            participation,employment,enrollment,families,Female\n            Education,female enrollment,female graduates,female\n            participation,female students,female teachers,financial\n            resources,girls,hygiene,Institutional\n            Development,intervention,interventions,labor\n            market,leadership,level of education,local communities,mass\n            media,Mathematics,Mid-Term Review,motivation,Orientation\n            Courses,papers,parents,Posters,primary education,primary\n            schools,public awareness,quality of education,school\n            enrollments,School Management,School Management\n            Committees,school performance,schooling,schools,Secondary\n            Education,secondary enrollment,secondary level,secondary\n            schools,siblings,skills training,social development,Social\n            Policy,stipends,student\n            enrollment,Teacher,teachers,trainees,tuition fees,women teachers"}},"owner":"S.A.
