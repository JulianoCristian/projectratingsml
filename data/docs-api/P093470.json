Some\n            lessons learned included: this project is a stark reminder\n            that housing finance is embedded in the broader financial\n            markets, economy, and political situation of a country. The\n            social upheavals since the global financial crises of 2008\n            battered the financial system. With rising inflation and\n            falling investor confidence, financial depth (M2/GDP ratio)\n            fell sharply, as did capital markets activities. Housing\n            finance which seemed poised in 2005 for a major spurt in\n            growth and innovations was put on hold. However, a recovery\n            may have begun in 2015. In designing the project, it is\n            important to have a good understanding of the various formal\n            and informal market players that affect and would be\n            affected by the intervention. In Egypt, formal financial\n            institutions account for a small share of the market.\n            Self-finance plays a large role and so do informal lenders\n            extending personal loans to home buyers.\n            Builders/developers, especially those operating on a large\n            scale, may possess significant competitive advantages in\n            providing housing loans but they also raise concerns. The\n            case of Egypt provides an illustration. First, developers\n            are well positioned to assess the credit risk of\n            buyers/borrowers. The marketing and construction of housing\n            units allow developers to get to know and often work closely\n            with homebuyers. Second, developers typically keep the title\n            of a property for the first five years of the installment\n            plan and thereafter transfer the title but retain the\n            property as collateral."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt, Arab Republic of - Mortgage Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt, Arab Republic of -\n            Mortgage Finance

deepening financial markets, including secondary markets for\n            loans and increasing institutional investment opportunities,\n            depends not only on creating frameworks for new financing\n            mechanisms, but also on conditions in the underlying market\n            for primary lending and general economic activity. The\n            success of the project was also owed to good financial\n            fundamentals, as well as, an extreme care in designing the\n            liquidity facility and its lending mechanisms to avoid both\n            uncertainties in financial contracts and distortions in the\n            sector, a level, competitive playing field among primary\n            lenders, and conducive property registration and titling\n            processes. The main lesson learnt is that there are critical\n            factors that contribute to the success of the operations,\n            mainly: prior analytical work; strong policy dialogue with\n            the authorities; prompt response to client's needs and\n            the changing environment; provision of technical assistance;\n            conducive legal and regulatory framework; innovative and\n            creative approaches; consultations with the different\n            stakeholders; close coordination with International Finance\n            Corporation (IFC); effective cooperation with development\n            partners; and overall flexibility in implementation of the\n            reforms.
