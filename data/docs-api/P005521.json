Some lessons learned included: 1) providing\n            subsidies to promote the use of water-saving equipment is a\n            necessary but not sufficient condition, even when the\n            technologies increase production and lower production costs.\n            For drip irrigation to spread, government subsidies that\n            lower the cost of equipment are not enough because o f their\n            high transaction costs (farmers have to clean and service\n            the drip irrigation nozzles continually, and they need to\n            learn new fertilizer application techniques). Additional\n            measures and/or incentives may be required. It proved\n            necessary to support the creation of new agricultural\n            extension services to work with drip irrigators; 2)\n            providing unlimited access to credible environmental data\n            can be an effective way to promote change, institutionally\n            and on the ground. Under the WRMP, a study on flood\n            prevention created vulnerability maps to identify hotspot\n            areas, and these were put in the public domain. In\n            retrospect, having these spots clearly identified led to\n            flood prevention actions. Similarly, data on falling levels\n            of agricultural chemicals in the aquifer is helping to\n            promote drip irrigation; and 3) the use of geographic\n            information system (GIS) software during environmental\n            monitoring can help to assess levels of aquifer pollution.\n            Water quality monitoring efforts clearly identified the\n            geographic areas where reductions in agricultural chemical\n            might be expected to reach subterranean aquifers. When the\n            responsible parties knew where to look for water quality\n            improvements, they were able to document major improvements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Water Resources

sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that project coordination with a large\n            number of implementing agencies and directorates requires\n            well established and efficient mechanisms. Policy reforms\n            and capacity building (institutional engineering) require\n            much preparatory work and close supervision, especially in\n            the case of creating new institutions. A project requiring\n            new legislation takes longer than expected to implement. A\n            project with strong emphasis on institutional development,\n            policy reforms and strategic national studies is extremely\n            difficult to implement. Participation of all stakeholders in\n            the project design is important. A strong Monitoring and\n            Evaluation unit should be set up at project start, not only\n            to look at the physical and financial aspects of the\n            project, but also to monitor its impact and sustainability.\n            When large numbers of extensive studies are planned, the\n            mechanisms and procedures for reviewing/monitoring the\n            activities and validating the outputs should be kept as\n            simple and as efficient as possible, particularly if several\n            partners/ministries are concerned. Fixing conditions,\n            whether for loan negotiation, agreement or extension, should\n            be approached with caution and only after ensuring that all\n            the elements are in place for making the required outcomes\n            possible. Providing technical assistance and training to the\n            implementing agencies through a contract with an\n            international agency such as FAO, to be signed at the onset\n            of the project, is a good and efficient way to ensure that\n            those two components are implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -

The project\n            includes the following three components:  1) Policy reforms\n            and institutional development will promote integrated water\n            resources management by establishing a rational tariff\n            policy, increasing cost recovery and establishing\n            Morocco's first BRA (River Basin Agency).  2)  Capacity\n            building in water resource planning, information systems,\n            and technology will improve national and river basin\n            planning, monitoring, and management capability.  Water\n            conservation technology will also be fostered through\n            applied research.  3) Investments in water mobilization and\n            quality will improve productivity through rehabilitation and\n            maintenance of dams, safety monitoring, and groundwater\n            sewerage systems in small urban centers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Water Resources Management
