Although there were difficult times and serious\n            problems, the overall picture and the result are clearly a\n            great success. Through all of the various phases and\n            incidences the Bank performed well and in particular\n            demonstrated the flexibility to adjust quickly to changes\n            and emergencies. The project has been as productive as\n            envisioned and has achieved its objectives of water storage,\n            power generation and its economic rate of return is at least\n            equal to the feasibility study estimate The response,\n            assistance and cooperation of the donor community was\n            superb. Particularly helpful was their willingness to place\n            the money at the disposal of the Bank as a pool. A lesson\n            learned is that for such a large project, with numerous\n            donors, a common pool of funds results in more flexible fund\n            management to the advantages of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
