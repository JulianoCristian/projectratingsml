The project\n            would include the construction and operation of an open pit\n            mine, single line ore processing facilities, ancillary\n            on-site facilities, a town-site, a river wharf, an access\n            road, a natural gas pipeline and airstrip improvements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Cerro Matoso Nickel Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Cerro Matoso Nickel Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/09/726776/colombia-cerro-matoso-nickel-project","projn":"CO-Nickel Cerro Matoso -- P006766","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Primary Metals,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Montreal Protocol","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912410847"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other industry","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aircraft\n            industry,Alloys,aluminum,Argon,asbestos,automobile\n            industry,bauxite,Castings,catalysts,ceramic,chemical\n            industry,chemistry,chromium,CO,Coal,coal\n            reserves,Construction,copper,corrosion,DMT,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic factors,Emeralds,Employment,Energy\n            Consumption,expenditures,exploitation,exploration and\n            mining,exploration efforts,financial\n            resources,Gas,Geology,GNP,gold,grading,imports,Income,inventories,iron,iron\n            ore,laterite,Legislation,Lng,manganese,marginal propensity\n            to consume,market economies,Metals,Mine Development,mineral\n            concessions,Mineral Economics,mineral exploration,mineral\n            rights,mineral sector,Minerals,mines,mining companies,Mining\n            Policy,mining projects,MINING\n            SECTOR,molybdenum,Nickel,Nickel\n            Alloys,nitrogen,oligopoly,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,Oxides,Oxygen,pellets,phosphates,plastics,platinum,Precious\n            Metals,Producers,Programs,Real\n            GNP,refining,Savings,sea,silicon,silver,small\n            scale,smelter,Stainless Steel,Steel,steel industry,steelmaking,Steels,sulphur,titanium,turbines,uranium,zinc"},"1":{"cdata!":"aircraft\n            industry,Alloys,aluminum,Argon,asbestos,automobile\n            industry,bauxite,Castings,catalysts,ceramic,chemical\n            industry,chemistry,chromium,CO,Coal,coal\n            reserves,Construction,copper,corrosion,DMT,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic factors,Emeralds,Employment,Energy\n            Consumption,expenditures,exploitation,exploration and\n            mining,exploration efforts,financial\n            resources,Gas,Geology,GNP,gold,grading,imports,Income,inventories,iron,iron\n            ore,laterite,Legislation,Lng,manganese,marginal propensity\n            to consume,market economies,Metals,Mine Development,mineral\n            concessions,Mineral Economics,mineral exploration,mineral\n            rights,mineral sector,Minerals,mines,mining companies,Mining\n            Policy,mining projects,MINING\n            SECTOR,molybdenum,Nickel,Nickel\n            Alloys,nitrogen,oligopoly,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,Oxides,Oxygen,pellets,phosphates,plastics,platinum,Precious\n            Metals,Producers,Programs,Real\n            GNP,refining,Savings,sea,silicon,silver,small\n            scale,smelter,Stainless Steel,Steel,steel industry,steelmaking,Steels,sulphur,titanium,turbines,uranium,zinc"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"2149"},"facets":{}}}
