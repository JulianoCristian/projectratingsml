Some of\n            the lessons learned include: Good analytical work is an\n            important underpinning for program design, but it is not\n            sufficient. Program design must be strategic, practical,\n            prioritized, and take into account the implementation and\n            absorptive capacity of the borrower.Project design based on\n            a complex institutional reform agenda and its implementation\n            would benefit from explicitly recognizing the iterative\n            nature of the reform process. There should be provisions for\n            frequent, in-depth supervision to inform periodically on\n            critical intervention areas that may need to be adjusted and\n            prioritized. Financing retrenchment of government employees\n            can be deeply unpopular andcarries a significant\n            reputational risk for the Bank. Unless retrenchment\n            reformsare accompanied with complementary reforms and\n            progress is closely monitoredto avoid reentry of civil\n            servants the intervention is unlikely to be effective. The\n            Bank has a rich history in retrenchment reforms and design\n            of interventionsshould carefully draw on previous\n            experience. Merit based recruitment of senior civil servants\n            is a critical aspect to performancemanagement. Performance\n            contracts are of limited value if senior civil servantsare\n            politically appointed and can be dismissed arbitrarily as\n            was the case in Zambia.Consolidating fragmented bank\n            accounts takes significant political will and maybe given\n            low priority during a time of economic growth and fiscal\n            expansion. Idle balances should be of particular concern to\n            countries prone to external shocks,  as the lack of a\n            treasury single account means that these funds cannot be\n            drawn on tocushion against unanticipated financing gaps. A\n            contractual and implementation arrangement for IFMIS that\n            assumes that acomprehensive off-the-shelf enterprise\n            resource planning package wouldcorrespond to actual\n            government and user requirements is not realistic.\n            Significant configuration and parametrization will still be\n            necessary. The Zambia case shows that the simultaneous\n            implementation of all Integrated Financial Management\n            Information System (IFMIS)modules is difficult and rarely\n            feasible. Instead a sequenced roll-out approach,prioritizing\n            core treasury reforms, can reap important low-hanging fruit\n            and ensure that client capacity is not overburdened. The\n            Bank may consider an approach where it supports training and\n            technicalsupport, leaving the financing of system\n            implementation to the client. When an implementation\n            strategy involves an interim basic custom system, it is\n            important that it is based on ex ante control of\n            transactions. In Zambia the Financial management system\n            (FMS) cannot be used to implement commitment or even basic\n            budget or cash control.The introduction of advanced\n            budgeting techniques, such as program / activity based\n            budgeting, should be introduced only after a fully\n            functioning IFMIS is in place."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Public Sector Management Program\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - Public Sector Management\n            Program Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/06/26595138/zambia-public-sector-management-program-support-project","topic":"Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Public Administration m1327723 723,Public Finance m1326315 713,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Management Information Systems\n            (FMIS) m1327331 683,Monetary Policy and Growth m1326242 1076","projn":"ZM-Public Sector Management Program Support\n            Project -- P082452","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Zambia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b084486dff_1_0"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Debt management and fiscal sustainability,Law reform,Other public sector governance,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Public Administration m1327723 723,Public Finance m1326315 713,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Management Information Systems\n            (FMIS) m1327331 683,Monetary Policy and Growth m1326242 1076","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"Governance - GP (GGODR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Economic management,Rule of law,Public sector governance","repnb":"106280"},"17536969":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/04/17536969/zambia-public-service-management-program-support-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/04/17536969/zambia-public-service-management-program-support-project","new_url":"2016/04/17536969/zambia-public-service-management-program-support-project","disclosure_date":"2016-04-04T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-04-04T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-04-04T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b0828b7a61","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0828b7a61","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/04/05/090224b0828b7a61/_/Rendered/INDEX/ICR24840P082450Official0use0only090.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/04/05/090224b0828b7a61/_/Rendered/PDF/ICR24840P082450Official0use0only090.pdf","loan_no":"41400","datestored":"2013-04-05T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2013-03-28T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309938","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Public Service Management Program\n            Support Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Public Service\n            Management Program Support Project for Zambia were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory and borrower performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory.

reinforce the role of the\n            budget as an instrument to reflect government priorities,\n            and discipline the use of public funds. Transparency and\n            accountability will be further increased in the budget, and\n            procurement systems, payments and incentive systems will be\n            improved, and, ministry structures and management incentives\n            will be realigned so as to increase performance and public\n            service delivery.

Establishment and Payroll\n            Control: implementation of the computer-based Payroll\n            Management and Establishment Control (PMEC) system, to help,\n            and ensure actual establishment is reflected in the payroll\n            data. Financial and Policy Management: the Medium Term\n            Expenditure Framework (MTEF) ensures the basis for\n            disbursements, including that of the Activity Based\n            Budgeting System, ensuring the requirement of Cabinet\n            Memoranda that have financial implications to be cleared by\n            the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MoFNP), prior\n            to Cabinet approval. Financial Management and\n            Accountability: will ensure auditing through the Auditor\n            General's report of government accounts, as per\n            regulations of the 2002 government financial statements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia -
