Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are assessed as satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include the following: Projects of high complexity--such as\n            university reform--are unlikely to capture all the\n            intricacies of the system or anticipate every eventuality,\n            no matter how well prepared or designed the investments.\n            Project implementers and supervisors should be able to make\n            the necessary adjustments to protect design with the support\n            of IDA management and Government. Also, in highly complex\n            and reform-oriented projects, it is better to link\n            achievement of development objectives to the implementation\n            of policy reforms rather than to a specific set of\n            predetermined activities. Second, profound systemic reform\n            needs to evolve in an atmosphere of patient discourse with\n            and broad dialogue among all stakeholders. In Nepal, where\n            consensus-building is difficult for a young democracy such\n            as this, it is especially important to incorporate extensive\n            public dialogue into project design, in order to enhance\n            citizen participation in the design of local institutions.\n            Cost recovery and decentralization initiatives in Tribhuvan\n            University became successful largely due to incentives provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Higher Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Higher Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1939076/nepal-higher-education-project","projn":"NP-Higher Education Project -- P010454","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Teaching and Learning,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02070904045140"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Secondary education,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,active\n            participation,adaptability,addition,additional\n            resources,agricultural education,air,Computer\n            Applications,curricula,curriculum,Curriculum\n            Development,decentralization,Development\n            Program,Drawing,Education,education budget,education\n            degrees,education institutions,education programs,education\n            reform,education system,Educational Management,Educational\n            Research,Engineering,Engineering\n            Education,enrollment,enrollment\n            growth,equipment,extension,external support,Girls,higher\n            education reform,Humanities,Innovation,Institutional\n            Development,instructional\n            materials,integration,laboratories,laboratory\n            equipment,libraries,Mid-Term Review,national\n            policies,Proficiency,research centers,rural areas,Rural\n            Development,scholarships,Secondary Education,secondary\n            enrollment,secondary level,secondary schools,Social\n            Sciences,Sports,student unions,targeted\n            incentives,teacher,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            materials development,Tertiary\n            Education,textbooks,universities,urban areas,Wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,active\n            participation,adaptability,addition,additional\n            resources,agricultural education,air,Computer\n            Applications,curricula,curriculum,Curriculum\n            Development,decentralization,Development\n            Program,Drawing,Education,education budget,education\n            degrees,education institutions,education programs,education\n            reform,education system,Educational Management,Educational\n            Research,Engineering,Engineering\n            Education,enrollment,enrollment\n            growth,equipment,extension,external support,Girls,higher\n            education reform,Humanities,Innovation,Institutional\n            Development,instructional\n            materials,integration,laboratories,laboratory\n            equipment,libraries,Mid-Term Review,national\n            policies,Proficiency,research centers,rural areas,Rural\n            Development,scholarships,Secondary Education,secondary\n            enrollment,secondary level,secondary schools,Social\n            Sciences,Sports,student unions,targeted\n            incentives,teacher,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            materials development,Tertiary\n            Education,textbooks,universities,urban areas,Wood"}},"owner":"S.A.
