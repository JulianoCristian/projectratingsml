The economic\n            rate of return was about 34 percent for the Fifth project\n            and 37 percent for the Sixth. The gap between agricultural\n            interest rates on the one hand and inflation levels and\n            commercial rates on the other hand progressively widened as\n            no provisions were made for periodic adjustments. This\n            impacted an accelerating demand for credit and a slow\n            deterioration of the Borrower's sound financial\n            position. Significant progress was made in two areas of\n            institution building: expansion of training and evaluation\n            system. As a result, the Borrower was able to expand\n            markedly its technical assistance to participating banks and\n            to provide for the first time sufficient details on the\n            production impact of its investments. The Borrower's\n            capabilities for sectorial analysis, planning, programming,\n            and internal control of subloans proved less than adequate\n            in the face of strongly expanded demand. These problems were\n            addressed through the subsequent Seventh Project. Lessons\n            learned up through the Sixth Project prompted designs in the\n            Seventh Project to: strengthen the Borrower's planning\n            mechanism and coordination with public agencies; provide an\n            operating regulation and procedures manual to furnish\n            direction and guidelines to participating banks in lending\n            to agriculture; intensify training programs for the\n            technical staff of the Borrower and participating banks in\n            order to strengthen the credit and technical assistance\n            delivery system; and strengthen and improve the\n            Borrower's database system and its monitoring and\n            evaluation capabilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
