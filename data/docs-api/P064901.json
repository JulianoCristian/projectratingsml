The lessons learned from this project include:\n            a) A programmatic approach to support pension reform could\n            be relevant for pension reform since it allows for a series\n            of modular or sequential reform packages. It controls the\n            risk of non-performance by conditioning future programs\n            based on current performance. b) Protecting key social\n            protection sectors during adjustment operations may yield\n            positive payoffs in terms of improved poverty indicators\n            following the aftermath of economic shocks. c) Successful\n            pension reform requires substantial dialogue, discussion and\n            debate with local counterparts, policymakers, and experts.\n            Toward that end, the present pension reform agenda in Brazil\n            took its roots through a series of seminars, debates, and\n            training sessions organized jointly by the Borrower and the\n            Bank. d) Technical assistance and knowledge dissemination\n            are very effective de-politicizing tools. The widespread\n            training of Bank's Pension Reform Options Simulation\n            Toolkit - a toolkit developed by the Bank for analyzing\n            pension reform - in Brazil stirred debate and dialogue as\n            the structural weaknesses of these plans became evident to\n            policymakers, experts, and other relevant stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second

To this effect, legislation has\n            been enacted, defining the new basis for benefit\n            calculations for retirees, respecting the principle of\n            fiscal balance, to take place in the next three years.\n            Further reforms, include the drafting of legislation, and\n            issuance of regulations to strengthen the regulatory\n            framework of the pension system for private sector workers,\n            and of complementary pension funds in the restructuring of\n            the National Institute of Social Security. The adoption of\n            this new formula for private sector workers, will reduce the\n            deficit of the system, and contribute to fiscal adjustments,\n            which will in turn improve rapid growth, and low inflation\n            prospects, paramount for poverty reduction. However,\n            moderate risks remain, since it is common that the adoption\n            of this new benefit formula, could be subjected to legal\n            challenges. But the strong commitment to the reform program\n            suggests this risk is minimal, furthermore, when some of\n            these reforms have already been approved by the Chamber."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Social Security Special\n            Sector Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Second Social Security\n
