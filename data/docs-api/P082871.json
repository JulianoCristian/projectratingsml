Program 1, Programmatic Decentralization and\n            Competitiveness SAL, had the following ratings: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low to\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Program 2, Second PROGRAMATIC\n            REFORM FOR GROWTH Project had the following ratings:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low to negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Program 3, Third\n            Programmatic Decentralization and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan had the following ratings: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low to\n            negligible, Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            included: 1) Operations designed for middle income countries\n            with highly skilled government staff and were first\n            generation reforms have been already implemented, need to\n            place strong emphasis in building the program in a\n            participatory and consultative way. The achievements of the\n            DCDPL series can be attributed to a number of reasons: (a)\n            the reforms were not imposed by the Bank but rather demand\n            driven by the beneficiaries; (b) there was a consensus among\n            civil society in favor of decentralization; (c) there was a\n            strong lead agency in the MEF to spearhead the process; (d)\n            Peru drew from the Bank's global experience with\n            decentralization and competitiveness; (e) the reform program\n            was designed and implemented gradually; (f) Peru already had\n            the legal framework within which other reforms could be\n            implemented; and (g) the process of change was taken as a\n            national project; 2) The DCDPL series drew on a wide range\n            of analytical work undertaken by the Bank, as well as other\n            analytical work carried out by the Government or research\n            institutions; and 3) Another key lesson is that the program\n            had built in at the onset a degree of flexibility that\n            allowed accommodating to evolving priorities and needs of\n            the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Decentralization and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Decentralization and\n

Programmatic Decentralization and\n            Competitiveness Structural Adjustment Loan Project aims to\n            assist the Government of Peru implement the decentralization\n            of public functions and resources, in tandem with measures\n            to help ensure continued sound public finances, and economic\n            growth. The program proposes the first of three loans, using\n            a Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan instrument to\n            support short- and medium-term reforms on state\n            decentralization, and economic competitiveness. A\n            single-tranche programmatic loan would be followed by two\n            further single-tranche loans. The first proposed loan has\n            three specific objectives 1) protect fiscal sustainability\n            during Peru's transition to a more decentralized state;\n            2) assist in strengthening management, and fiscal capacity\n            at sub-national levels for their progressive assumption of\n            service responsibilities; and, 3) support the creation of a\n            better regulatory, and investment environment for upgrading\n            Peru's competitiveness. The subsequent loans will\n            depend on the progress of this initial reform program. An\n            underlying objective of the proposed Loan is to enrich, and\n            extend the government's overall program of accelerated\n            reforms over the past two years. However, risks have been\n            identified in political, economic, financial and technical\n            areas. To mitigate these risks, dialogues with the\n            opposition, and civil society in general, export\n            diversification and competitiveness, the continued\n            strengthening of bank supervision, and a debt management\n            strategy in particular, will outweigh such risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Programmatic Decentralization and\n            Competitiveness
