in Southern Tunisia by\n            developing the groundwater resources of the region with a\n            view to increasing the production of dates (mostly for\n            export), vegetables and forage, improving the living\n            standards of the smallholders in the existing oases and\n            providing employment opportunities for farm labor in the new\n            oases. It would consist of: (i) rehabilitation of 7 existing\n            oases on about 3,000 ha in the Djerid, Nefzaoua and Gabes\n            areas; (ii) creation of 9 new date palm plantations and date\n            palm/forage plantations on 2,100 ha in the Djerid and\n            Nefzaoua areas; (iii) creation of a date processing\n            facility; and (iv) provision of equipment, facilities and\n            personnel for agriculture services, research and technical\n            assistance (60 man-months). About 5,100 small holders or\n            about 30,600 people, mostly in low-income groups would\n            benefit from the project. In addition, improved income\n            opportunities would be provided to about 1,100 permanent\n            workers and about 114,000 man-days of seasonal work would be created."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Southern Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Southern Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/12/726457/tunisia-southern-irrigation-project","projn":"TN-Southern Irrigation -- P005634","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Drylands & Desertification,Water Conservation,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912473464"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to credit,agricultural\n            cooperatives,Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            extension,agricultural investments,Agricultural\n            prices,Agricultural Production,agricultural\n            products,agricultural research,Agricultural\n            training,Agriculture,animals,aquifers,Audits,barley,canals,cereals,channel,clays,commercial\n            banks,commodities,conservation,crops,cultivable land,dairy\n            products,desertification,development\n            projects,ditches,drainage,drip irrigation,drought,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equipment,erosion,Expenditures,exploitable\n            water,exploitable water\n            resources,Exploitation,extension,extension\n            services,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizers,financial\n            resources,fish,fisheries,forage,Forestry,forests,fruits,goats,grazing,grazing\n            lands,imports,income,incomes,industrial\n            water,Irrigation,labor force,Land reform,Land Tenure,Land\n            Use,Livestock,livestock products,living\n            conditions,Marketing,municipal water,natural\n            resources,oases,Oasis,oil,pest control,pesticides,pilot\n            farms,population growth,porosity,potable water,private\n            sector,productivity,programs,pumps,rainfall,rainfed\n            crops,rangeland,rangelands,recharge,Rural Development,Rural\n            Roads,saline water,salinity,salinization,salty\n            soils,sand,sandy soils,seepage,sheep,Soil,Soil\n            Resources,soils,temperature,trees,UNDP,unemployment,vegetables,water\n            consumption,water deficits,Water distribution,water\n            quality,water resources,water supply,water table,wells,wheat,Winds"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to credit,agricultural\n            cooperatives,Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            extension,agricultural investments,Agricultural\n            prices,Agricultural Production,agricultural\n            products,agricultural research,Agricultural\n            training,Agriculture,animals,aquifers,Audits,barley,canals,cereals,channel,clays,commercial\n            banks,commodities,conservation,crops,cultivable land,dairy\n            products,desertification,development\n            projects,ditches,drainage,drip irrigation,drought,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equipment,erosion,Expenditures,exploitable\n            water,exploitable water\n            resources,Exploitation,extension,extension\n            services,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizers,financial\n            resources,fish,fisheries,forage,Forestry,forests,fruits,goats,grazing,grazing\n            lands,imports,income,incomes,industrial\n            water,Irrigation,labor force,Land reform,Land Tenure,Land\n            Use,Livestock,livestock products,living\n            conditions,Marketing,municipal water,natural\n            resources,oases,Oasis,oil,pest control,pesticides,pilot\n            farms,population growth,porosity,potable water,private\n            sector,productivity,programs,pumps,rainfall,rainfed\n            crops,rangeland,rangelands,recharge,Rural Development,Rural\n            Roads,saline water,salinity,salinization,salty\n            soils,sand,sandy soils,seepage,sheep,Soil,Soil\n            Resources,soils,temperature,trees,UNDP,unemployment,vegetables,water\n            consumption,water deficits,Water distribution,water\n            quality,water resources,water supply,water table,wells,wheat,Winds"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"2681"},"facets":{}}}
