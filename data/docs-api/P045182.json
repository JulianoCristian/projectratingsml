Some lessons learned included: to be\n            effective, decentralization requires adequate financial and\n            human resources and must be accompanied by an effective\n            monitoring of results by the central Government and by\n            establishing a clear sense of accountability among local\n            authorities. To deliver results, project rules should be as\n            simple as possible and fully flexible, as the commitment of\n            populations is a direct function of the speed at which\n            subprojects are prepared. In addition, capacity building at\n            decentralized level can only be effective when the size and\n            number of local entities is adequate. Self-standing RWSS\n            projects should also aim at facilitating harmonization and\n            preparing to scale up and to shift to a sector-wide approach\n            and budget support by: (i) providing a complete set of\n            tested guidelines and procedures for preparing and\n            implementing investments and for managing and delivering\n            services; and (ii) enabling sector staff, rather than\n            consultants, to elaborate objectives and policy matrix\n            actions. As it was the case in Rwanda, only a strong\n            sectoral leadership at the ministerial level can create\n            incentives for staff and donors to internalize the change in\n            approach and to ensure harmonization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Rural Water Supply and\n

Mitigating measures call for: 1) installation\n            of latrines, or septic tanks, to be located at a distance of\n            no less than two hundred and twenty meters from the well, or\n            bore-hole, with provision for water testing training; 2) a\n            public awareness campaign, to inform consumers on potential\n            water contamination and sludge, resulting from construction\n            materials. Populations should be aware of this fact until\n            infrastructure is stabilized; 3) protective measures will be\n            in place on construction sites, enclosing the area with\n            barriers, and, regulations will be enforced by government\n            officials; 4) herbal vegetation with shallow roots will be\n            planted to avoid soil erosion, preferably, gramineous\n            species, which do not dry water sources. Recommendations\n            include re-enforcement of monitoring, and management testing\n            capacities, provision of rain water canalization to ensure\n            pasture lands, and, necessary controls to ensure water quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Rural Water and Sanitation Project\n            : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda \u2013 Projet\n            d\u2019approvisionnement en eau et d\u2019assainissement en milieu\n            rural : \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/05/443569/rwanda-rural-water-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"RW-Rural Water Supply And Sanitation Project\n            -- P045182","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Rwanda","authors":{"authr":"Bikwemu, Gaspard, International Consultant"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00082205412366"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Water supply,Sanitation","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Water supply &\n            sanitation; Rural water supply; Sludge treatment; Soil\n            erosion; Water quality management; Septic tanks; Latrines;\n            Soil management; Community participation; Public awareness;\n            Rainwater catchment; Vegetative propagation; Water analysis;\n            Canals design & construction; Regulatory framework"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"E376","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Projet d'Alimentation en\n            Eau et Assainissement en Milieu Rural : analyse environnementale"}}},"437662":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/05/437662/rwanda-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/05/437662/rwanda-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project","new_url":"2000/05/437662/rwanda-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/10/000094946_00051905305043/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/10/000094946_00051905305043/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"3368;Q138","datestored":"2000-06-10T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2000-05-10T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project aims at increasing availability of water supply, and\n            sanitation services in rural areas in Rwanda.
