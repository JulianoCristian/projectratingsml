Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, a\n            project's scope and implementing mechanisms must be\n            tailored to the Borrower's design and planning\n            capabilities, and the Borrower, as well as the ultimate\n            beneficiaries, must really want the project and be closely\n            involved in its preparation. Second, proper project\n            management must be available before project start-up and\n            assured at all times. Sound management is key, from the\n            design stage through implementation, to the very achievement\n            of project objectives. Third, forest management, including\n            conservation, cannot be addressed in isolation of the\n            management of surrounding areas. Finally, regarding\n            fisheries, the issue of dramatically diminishing resources\n            must be at the center of any operation in this sector and\n            geographic
