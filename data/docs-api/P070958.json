Some lessons learned included:\n            intergovernmental fiscal reform is a long and complex\n            undertaking that requires strong leadership and multi-phased\n            support and government continued commitment. A review of the\n            political economy in such projects will help develop\n            strategies to strengthen the responsible agencies.\n            Addressing several diverse and complex themes in a limited\n            capacity environment plants several seeds of reform but can\n            limit the depth of success of each theme. Starting the\n            process of reform with a simple project with limited but\n            clear objectives could lead to better performance.\n            Restructuring is an opportunity to formally clarify broad\n            project development objectives, and align them with\n            appropriate monitoring and evaluation frameworks. Demand\n            driven municipal infrastructure and revenue earning\n            sub-projects require clear definitions so as to enable\n            private sector activities. Pilot database systems need\n            adequate human and financial resources to be rolled out to\n            the larger intended targets and to be updated with new\n            information regularly for the system to be useful. Hands-on\n            training provided during implementation (e.g. procurement\n            and environment) help build knowledge and resolve problems\n            to improve ratings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan -
