The\n            lessons learned indicate that the partnering and working\n            together in common cause of the Lender and Borrower in\n            preparing, adopting, monitoring, implementing and evaluating\n            the various components of the credit account for the\n            satisfactory ratings. The key here was the linkage of the\n            credit to internal reforms currently being undertaken by the\n            Government of Senegal (GOS) and the level of communications\n            and collaboration established. The credit was part of an\n            existing comprehensive commitment on the part of the GOS to\n            embark on trade and tax reform in its fight against poverty.\n            The desired goal was consistent with the objective of this\n            credit being a more open and competitive economy with its\n            emphasis on demonstrated its commitment to reform as set out\n            in 3.3.1. Keeping disbursement conditions few in number and\n            focused on specific objectives rather than on actions\n            requiring micro-management of project components allowed for\n            satisfactory implementation of this credit. The key here was\n            the emphasis on results leaving the means to the borrower.\n            The key to successful implementation was the challenge of\n            getting the GOS to take ownership of the process. Managing\n            and assessing the risks at the outset are also important\n            ingredients for successful implementation. The facts that\n            implementation of similar management information systems had\n            been implemented elsewhere and that subscription to West\n            African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) tenets\n            prohibited imposition of new import protection measures\n            served as mitigating risk factors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -

The project\n            will improve competitiveness, through trade liberalization,\n            easing trade and taxation, and supporting regulatory\n            programs that promote competitive pricing of public utility\n            inputs to the productive sector. The first tranche of the\n            operation, will finance the implementation of the tariff,\n            and tax reforms, adjustments in customs, and tax procedures,\n            and the establishment of performance criteria for these\n            reforms. The second tranche, will support an adjustment\n            program, with full data links between the customs, and tax\n            departments. The legislative framework will be developed, to\n            define the regulatory system for public utilities, and\n            infrastructure. Nonetheless, competitiveness measures rely\n            on an integrated plan for Government data systems, which may\n            encounter implementation difficulties, and, some economic\n            entities may try to regain their lost import protection.\n            These risks would be mitigated by sound competitive\n            practices, successfully integrated in developing countries,\n
