Some\n            lessons learned included: establishing clear linkages\n            between economic benefits and resource conservation. The\n            benefits of long-term sustained economic resource flows from\n            conservation such as through tourism and employment in\n            Protected Area (PA) management were found to be essential to\n            ensure sustainability in several conservation projects at\n            the time, particularly in the India Eco development Project.\n            Building understanding and consensus among stakeholders. A\n            key lesson from other projects in the sector illustrated the\n            need to build consensus among stakeholders on project\n            objectives, activities and roles. Planning for long term\n            sustainability. Providing start up funding, appropriate\n            asset management arrangements and assessing the legal\n            framework for the establishment of a trust fund were\n            important lessons that had begun to appear in the sector. At\n            the time of project preparation, conservation trust funds\n            were beginning to take shape internationally. Experience\n            with these funds highlighted the value of having reliable\n            funding available during the initial stages of a trust fund\n            to begin investing in activities before investment income\n            becomes available. PAMP planned its activities around the\n            notion of establishing a park association early in the\n            project that would be capitalized with $2 million in seed\n            funding. However, the association was established late in\n            the project and the opportunity to bridge its beginnings\n            until it was flush with investment income was squandered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - GEF Protected Areas Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - GEF Protected Areas\n            Management

While involuntary resettlement issues\n            are not envisaged, restrictions on the access by surrounding\n            communities to utilize resources, within the protected areas\n            (PAs), will need to be introduced, to prevent further\n            ecological degradation. Nonetheless, management practices,\n            and alternative income generation measures will be agreed\n            upon with those whose livelihood is affected by project\n            implementation. By and large, communities in the PAs will be\n            allowed to a continued grazing, and fuel-wood/timber\n            extraction for subsistence needs, but under Park\n            supervision. However, the introduction of culturally\n            compatible, alternative livelihood measures (income\n            generation), raises questions, namely regarding the Kalash\n            group, whose goat rearing practices in high altitudes, of\n            cultural significance, offsets possible restrictions in the\n            utilization of high alpine pastures. Environmental\n            mitigation addresses: biodiversity conservation, through\n            committed, community involvement to specific, measurable\n            actions; limiting the use of agrochemicals, or unnecessary\n            construction activity; development of participatory\n            fuel-wood impact assessments; management strategies for\n            summer, and winter pasture uses; management of no-timber\n            forest products, and of no illegal timber extraction; and,\n            fisheries management, within the estuarine, and marine zone\n            of the PAs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Protected Areas Management\n            Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Protected Areas\n            Management Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/03/1047378/pakistan-protected-areas-management-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"PK-Protected Areas Management Project -- P035823","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Social Capital,Community Development and Empowerment,Environmental Economics & Policies,TF054599-PHRD-KYRGYZ REPUBLIC: WATER\n            MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","teratopic":"Social Development,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01032007103423"},"theme":"Participation and civic engagement,Biodiversity,Rural policies and institutions,Export development and competitiveness,Environmental policies and institutions","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,General public administration sector,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector,Other social services","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"beneficiary communities,biodiversity\n            conservation,capacity building,COMMUNITIES,community\n            access,community consultation,community\n            contributions,community development,Community\n            involvement,community members,community\n            organization,community participation,Community\n            representation,conflict resolution,Consensus,decision\n            making,drinking water,environmental\n            impacts,fisheries,fishing,focus groups,income,Indigenous\n            Peoples,information dissemination,institutional\n            capacity,Lessons learned,local capacity,local\n            communities,local government,migration,mobilization,natural\n            resource management,PA,participation of local\n            communities,participatory mapping,participatory\n            monitoring,Participatory Rural\n            Appraisal,pastures,PRA,project implementation,project\n            preparation,Protected Areas,resource use,social assessment,stakeholder,stakeholders,timber,transparency,village"},"1":{"cdata!":"beneficiary communities,biodiversity\n            conservation,capacity building,COMMUNITIES,community\n            access,community consultation,community\n            contributions,community development,Community\n            involvement,community members,community\n            organization,community participation,Community\n            representation,conflict resolution,Consensus,decision\n            making,drinking water,environmental\n            impacts,fisheries,fishing,focus groups,income,Indigenous\n            Peoples,information dissemination,institutional\n            capacity,Lessons learned,local capacity,local\n            communities,local government,migration,mobilization,natural\n            resource management,PA,participation of local\n            communities,participatory mapping,participatory\n            monitoring,Participatory Rural\n            Appraisal,pastures,PRA,project implementation,project\n            preparation,Protected Areas,resource use,social assessment,stakeholder,stakeholders,timber,transparency,village"}},"owner":"Envir & Nat.

Community orientation, and\n            mobilization will be provided, to map the community resource\n            utilization, and develop resource management strategies, and\n            mitigation measures; b) formulation of detailed park\n            management, and strategy, integrated into community\n            micro-planning, and micro-enterprise initiatives in\n            accordance with environmental programs, and traditional\n            ecological knowledge; c) improvement of park infrastructure;\n            d) improvement of park operations; e) development of a\n            baseline resource inventory, habitat improvement research,\n            and wildlife enrichment; and, f) creation of public\n            environmental awareness, and outreach programs. 2) Promotion\n            of public/private cooperation for long-term biodiversity\n            conservation, by providing TA, and supporting cost-sharing\n            arrangements, and, income-generating activities. 3) Support\n            an institutional capacity building training program, with\n            topics ranging from legal, and policy reform, to tourism\n            management, and plans. 4) Project coordination for the\n            development of policy, and legislation relating to protected\n            areas, ensuring standardized systems.
