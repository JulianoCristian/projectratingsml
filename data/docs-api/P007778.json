The sustainability of project activities is\n            rated as uncertain, but prospects are reasonable because of\n            continued support under other projects. Overall World Bank\n            performance was unsatisfacotry while Borrower performance\n            was mixed. Lessons learned included the following: The\n            strategy of using fairly independent project units to manage\n            project execution as a means of compensating for weak or\n            inexperienced line agency counterparts can work against the\n            objective of maintaining a strong sense of counterpart\n            ownership. To a large degree it is up to the national\n            leadership to make this inherently difficult relationship\n            work. Flexibility and simplicity of project design are\n            critical to avoid overwhelming the institutional capacity of\n            counterparts, especially in cases of first projects within a\n            sector. Clear and sustained government commitment and\n            leadership is indispensable to the success of major reform\n            efforts. Areas requiring cooperation among line institutions\n            need to be addressed at a project's outset to avoid\n            delays during implementation. For complex sector reform\n            programs involving a multiplicity of actions by different\n            actors and the gradual build-up of institutional capacities\n            to implement and sustain the changes, the adaptable program\n            loan/credit instrument may be preferable to a one-time\n            sector investment project. Effective donor coordination is\n            essential throughout project implementation, not just\n            project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Health Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua -
