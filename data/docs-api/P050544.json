Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) the FMIP experience confirms that\n            project design needs to be kept simple and within the\n            capacity of the staff and agencies who are responsible for\n            its implementation; 2) in countries where political\n            influence is difficult to avoid, the project team was able\n            to successfully adopt a decentralized implementation\n            mechanism which shielded the municipalities and the\n            implementing agency from various political interferences in\n            the country; 3) the project lacked clearly defined\n            monitoring indicators. For monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) to succeed it should focus on achieving results,\n            particularly for the poor and should not be unduly\n            burdensome to the municipalities. Strong M&E can also\n            help reduce the expense of cost-benefit analysis by\n            providing data needed to carry out economic analyses; and 4)\n            the project did not have any cost recovery mechanism built\n            in its design, possibly because it was evident that full\n            cost recovery will almost be impossible for several\n            municipal infrastructure investments. It will be prudent\n            however, if consideration could be given during future\n            project design to define realistic cost recovery system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - First Municipal Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - First Municipal\n            Infrastructure Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/06/10792513/lebanon-first-municipal-infrastructure-project","projn":"LB-- First Municipal Infrastructure Project\n            -- P050544","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"m,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Services to the Poor,Municipal Financial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Lebanon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20090708233138"},"theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Municipal governance and institution building","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to infrastructure, accounting, actual\n            cost, additional financing, Assessment of Risk, asset\n            management, assets, assistance activities, Auditing, audits,\n            Bank Lending, Bank Ratings, basic services, beneficiaries,\n            Beneficiary, beneficiary assessment, Borrower, borrowing,\n            business community, capacity building, capital projects,\n            cash flow, cities, communities, community development,\n            contingencies, contribution, cost recovery, credit capacity,\n            CURRENCY, decentralization, Description, disbursement ratio,\n            districts, economic analyses, economic analysis, economic\n            cost, Economic Development, employment, employment\n            opportunities, Engineer, engineers, Exchange Rate, Financial\n            Advisor, Financial Analysis, financial intermediary,\n            financial management, Financial Rate of Return, financial\n            resources, financial support, financial sustainability,\n            Gender, gender issues, general population, homes, hospitals,\n            households, housing, housing units, income, infrastructure\n            investments, infrastructure services, inhabitants,\n            institutional development, intergovernmental finance,\n            internal controls, intervention, investment choices,\n            investment decisions, key performance indicators, lack of\n            experience, life span, lifetime, living conditions, LOAN,\n            Loan Agreement, Loan disbursements, Local Administration,\n            Local Councils, local government, local government\n            expenditures, local governments, maintenance costs,\n            management reports, mobility, MUNICIPAL, municipal\n            development, municipal finance, municipal investments,\n            municipal taxes, Municipalities, new jobs, operating costs,\n            Peer Review, portfolio performance, Present Value, private\n            investment, public safety, rate of return, regional\n            development, responsibilities, resume, Road safety, Roads,\n            rural areas, rural communities, sanitation, savings,\n            schools, sewage, social services, Stakeholder, stakeholders,\n            tax collection, technical assistance, traffic, transitional\n            arrangements, urban development, Urban Planning, urban\n            population, urban roads, Urban Sector, urban services,\n            Urbanism, valuable, Waste, water supply, world markets, worth"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development (MNSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022549-PHRD-COMMUNITY DEV.
