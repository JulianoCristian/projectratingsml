It is important to carefully design the monitoring\n            instruments used, and to ensure that the third-party\n            monitors fully understand the project. Ensuring a quality\n            results framework based on reliable data during preparation\n            will decrease the need for future restructurings, increasing\n            the quality of supervision and overall efficiency. When\n            innovative approaches such as CCTs or Rural Female Teacher\n            (RFT) components are newly introduced in a country context,\n            additional technical assistance and time should be allocated\n            as a part of project design in order to provide the needed\n            support to implement the activities effectively. Keeping\n            designs as simple as possible and designing for existing\n            sector capacity can avoid lengthy delays at start-up."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Basic Education
