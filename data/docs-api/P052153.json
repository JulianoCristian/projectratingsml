Ratings for the Reform\n            Support Credit Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the experience of the Judicial Reform\n            Project shows that making the judiciary more independent,\n            effective, adherent to higher ethical standards and\n            professional requires interventions that go beyond\n            rehabilitating infrastructure, using information technology,\n            and educating the public. Establishment of an independent\n            and effective judiciary requires strong political will and\n            continuous commitment of the country authorities, which a\n            Bank operation can only complement, but not substitute for.\n            The experience of SAC3 and Reform Support Credits reiterates\n            that Bank support can be effective in promoting and\n            supporting change when the authorities are ready for reform,\n            but not otherwise. When the authorities are not ready it\n            could be argued that financial support may weaken the need\n            for change and strengthen the capacity to maintain the\n            status quo The experience of the Reform Support Credit shows\n            that simpler rules reduce opportunities for corruption. When\n            the government simplified the rules and streamlined\n            administrative procedures in organizations like the traffic\n            police, customs, and tax administration their staff\n            delivered better services and extorted fewer bribes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Judicial Reform Project; Third\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project; Reform

        and a modest institutional development impact.  Project\n            sustainability is unlikely, with satisfactory performances\n            by both the Bank and the Borrower.  While SAC3 conditions\n            were implemented, they did not have the desired impacts\n            because of the poor governance environment. A number of\n            external factors inhibited the impact of the SAC3 including:\n            the Russian crisis of 1998; the presidential elections of\n            2000; and rising tensions over border security issues in\n            2002.  The Government has always supported the program, and\n            has been willing to intervene where implementing agencies\n            caused snags in implementation. Lessons learned include the\n            following.  SAC3 would have been better served by a\n            technical assistance project that supported not only\n            discrete activities, but aimed at true capacity building.\n            An operation with a significantly longer implementation time\n            would have better suited the Georgian reform programs.  The\n            Bank needs to be more realistic in estimating implementation\n            time, particularly for a three tranche operation with many\n            conditions.  The Bank needs to spend more time raising\n            ownership of the program at the level of implementing\n            agencies.  Finally, the quality of governance may dictate\n            the impact and the sustainability of the operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Third Structural Adjustment Credit
