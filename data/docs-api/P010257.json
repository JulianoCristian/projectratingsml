The project failed\n            to achieve several of its major objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, projects which aim to strengthen\n            political institutions and affect the system of governance\n            tend to be more vulnerable to changes in government. Second,\n            projects with long-term objectives are more susceptible to\n            changing macroeconomic and political situations. Third,\n            borrowers must be fully aware of the need for institutional\n            development and the long-term financial benefits it will\n            produce. Fourth, projects experiencing problems require an\n            intensive program of missions. Finally, performance\n            indicators should be identified in terms of the long-term\n            objectives of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Municipal Management
