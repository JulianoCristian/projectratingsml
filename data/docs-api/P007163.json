Overall the project outcome is rated\n            moderately satisfactory. The project substantially achieved\n            all of its physical objectives, but in several of the\n            project components there were significant problems. The PPAR\n            mission was able to ascertain that the institutional\n            capacity developed initially in the Reconstruction Unit (RU)\n            and implementing agencies is alive and well, albeit sitting\n            in new positions in the public and NGO sectors. Given the\n            amount of time that has elapsed since the project closed,\n            its sustainability can be rated on observed rather than\n            predicted performance. Some of the infrastructure developed\n            under the project has problems: the housing is made with\n            poor-quality materials, and a number of communities have\n            been built in areas safer from earthquakes but vulnerable to\n            run-off and landslides. The Bank responded quickly after the\n            1986 earthquake. The appraisal mission was staffed by some\n            of the Bank's foremost disaster experts. Bank staff\n            helped to design a project that addressed the problems\n            caused by the earthquake in a comprehensive way. The\n            government reports that the Bank also supported the work of\n            the RU quite effectively. Although there were problems with\n            reporting and accounts, the deconstruction Program is widely\n            considered to be a major government achievement.\n            Project-built infrastructure that remained in public hands\n            has been well maintained, and, notwithstanding all the\n            difficulties described in this report, government commitment\n            to cost recovery in the housing component is noteworthy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Earthquake Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador - Earthquake\n

Some lessons learned included: more attention\n            should be placed on the institutional appraisal of the\n            implementing agency, both with regard to awareness of\n            Bank's procurement procedures and of its capacity to\n            administer and manage the contracting of goods and services.\n            Prior to initiating bidding procedures, the implementing\n            agency should undertake an intensive review of completed\n            designs, plans, cost estimates, and bidding documents. Prior\n            to awarding civil works contracts, the necessary right of\n            way should be legally acquired in order to avoid delays in\n            the execution of works and corresponding increases in\n            project costs and possible claims. Beneficiaries of housing\n            credits also benefit from technical assistance in areas such\n            as energy saving technology, maintenance schedules, etc.\n            There are advantages in working with financial\n            intermediaries from the nongovernmental sector. During\n            procurement, an implementing agency should take into account\n            the scope of work, the project's complexity and the\n            capacity of local contractors in estimating the construction\n            period for project execution. In order to avoid long delays\n            in processing payments to contractors, disbursements should\n            be made from the project's special account directly to\n            the contractor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -

Earthquake Reconstruction Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Earthquake Reconstruction Project,\n            as a result of an earlier earthquake, seeks to (i)\n            rehabilitate and reconstruct the San Salvador metropolitan\n            area; and (ii) support the expansion of the capital city\n            towards the north (Apopa) which is less vulnerable to\n            earthquakes.  The project also hopes to (iii) rehabilitate\n            the microenterprise sector; and (iv) strengthen the\n            Government's capacity to plan and manage the\n            reconstruction efforts and enhance its preparedness to deal\n            with national emergencies.  To this end, the project\n            involves several components which are aimed at helping San\n            Salvador to recover from this natural disaster.  They\n            include:  (a) housing lines of credit; (b) schools and\n            public buildings; (c) roads and public services; and (d)\n            micro-enterprise credits.  The project further includes (e)\n            training; as well as (f) studies and technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Earthquake Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador - Earthquake\n            Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/08/739615/el-salvador-earthquake-reconstruction-project","projn":"SV-Earthquake Rec -- P007163","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Housing Finance,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"El Salvador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926111202"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other urban development","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acquisition costs,assets,BANK LOANS,Bank\n            supervision,commercial banks,construction,credit\n            line,creditworthiness,debt,disasters,disbursement,economic\n            recovery,electricity,employment,families,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediaries,financing\n            sources,foreign exchange,hospitals,houses,Housing,housing\n            credit,Housing Finance,Housing Finance Agency,housing\n            loans,housing needs,insurance,mortgage,mortgage\n            payments,nationalized banks,private sector,private sector\n            participation,public investment,public sector,public\n            services,Public Works,resource\n            allocation,Roads,schools,secondary schools,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunications,transport,unemployment,Urban\n            Development,Urban Growth,urban infrastructure,water\n            supply,workers,working capital,zoning"},"1":{"cdata!":"acquisition costs,assets,BANK LOANS,Bank\n            supervision,commercial banks,construction,credit\n            line,creditworthiness,debt,disasters,disbursement,economic\n            recovery,electricity,employment,families,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediaries,financing\n            sources,foreign exchange,hospitals,houses,Housing,housing\n            credit,Housing Finance,Housing Finance Agency,housing\n            loans,housing needs,insurance,mortgage,mortgage\n            payments,nationalized banks,private sector,private sector\n            participation,public investment,public sector,public\n            services,Public Works,resource\n            allocation,Roads,schools,secondary schools,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunications,transport,unemployment,Urban\n            Development,Urban Growth,urban infrastructure,water\n            supply,workers,working capital,zoning"}},"owner":"Central America Countries CMU (LCC2C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF022870-PHRD-EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION","repnb":"P4629"},"facets":{}}}
