Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, establishing surcharges on water tariffs for\n            further remittance to other entities, particularly for\n            financing operating expenditures, is risky. Second,\n            mitigation plans are essential. An environmental protection\n            project may generate negative side effects. The impact of\n            construction works in urban areas should not be overlooked.\n            Third, contract packaging should not aim exclusively at\n            minimizing the number of contracts to simplify procurement,\n            as large and heterogeneous contracts may have their\n            shortcomings in terms of contract management.
