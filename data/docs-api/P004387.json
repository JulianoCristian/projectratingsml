available and committed to the project; b) a\n            strong project management committee directs policy and\n            promotes the image of the project to Government and the\n            general public; and c) appropriate financial management is\n            available and practiced. 2) Much greater attention to\n            cultural and social factors could assist management to plan\n            and implement in a more timely manner, providing adequate\n            provision is made for appropriate staffing and counterpart\n            funding from the outset. 3) Project performance indicators,\n            a mid-term review, stricter adherence to more detailed\n            scheduling of events, and greater attention to monitoring\n            and evaluation throughout the life of the project could\n            reduce the implementation delays. 4) Clearer definition and\n            understanding of Borrower and the Bank procedures for\n            financial management, as well as trained personnel to\n            implement them could allow more effective disbursement. 5)\n            National procurement procedures could be simplified by the\n
