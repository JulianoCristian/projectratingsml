Some lessons learned included: involving\n            universities and civil society organizations will help to\n            improve the quality of training while reducing teacher\n            training costs. Universities will also provide accredited\n            certificates, which is a further incentive to become a\n            teacher. The MoE should initiate the necessary legislation\n            for legally valid training diplomas and accredited degrees\n            so teachers who choose to continue teaching can have\n            something to build on for further academic studies. While\n            general sectoral statements about all education projects\n            under implementation provide important insights, it will\n            have been clearer if the Third Party Monitoring (TPM)\n            reports had completely disaggregated findings by project so\n            that specific implementation issues could be more easily\n            followed and specific outputs more easily tracked. The\n            education sector had three World Bank-supervised projects\n            under implementation simultaneously and it was sometimes\n            difficult to distinguish between project-specific findings.\n            Future phases or projects should devise and administer a\n            simple learning test of students prior to and post-project\n            implementation to see if there was any impact on learning\n            levels after education quality interventions such as teacher\n            training and distribution and use of school supply

Due\n            to the crisis in Yemen which led to an increase in prices\n            and delays in implementation activities, the Republic of\n            Yemen has requested certain changes. These changes include:\n            extension of the closing date of the project; reallocation\n            of the proceeds of grant; and changes to indicators and\n            targets in the results framework. Due to the recent\n            increases in prices, the remaining funds for construction\n            for new and rehabilitated classrooms will cover 189 instead\n            of 247 classrooms. In addition to the revised number of\n            targeted classrooms, it is proposed to add one output\n            indicator for the construction activities. This indicator is\n            'the number of additional classrooms built or\n            rehabilitated at the primary level resulting from project\n            intervention. Price increases have also affected the number\n            of school kits that are able to be purchased under the\n            project. The project closing date will be extended from\n            September 30, 2012 to March 30, 2013. This is the first\n            extension of closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Phase Three Education for All\n            Fast-Track Initiative Catalytic Fund Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen -
