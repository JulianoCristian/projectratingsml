Ratings for the Second Public Sector\n            Management Adjustment Loan Project for Macedonia are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Public Finance Management\n            Project for Slovak Republic are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned include:\n            although differences dominated similarities in the three\n            projects, the one common factor that had a determining\n            influence on outcomes was the extent of government\n            commitment to the projects. Sound analytical work was\n            necessary but not sufficient for project success. All three\n            projects were based on sound analytical work and they\n            matched government strategy. In the case of the Public\n            Finance Management Project (PFMP) there was a hand-in-glove\n            match between analytical work and government strategy, as\n            the government adopted the full recommendations of the\n            Development Policy Review. Concentrating on core elements\n            was a factor contributing to success. Compared with the\n            PFMP, the other two projects over-reached in their ambitions\n            to achieve rather wide development policy goals. In the\n            main, introducing elements that were outside the purview of\n            the budget, such as health and pension reform, affected the\n            efficacy of these two operations and prevented them from\n            fully realizing their goals. Finally, when the different\n            elements of a project fit together well, the project has a\n            greater probability of success. The different elements of\n            the PFMP fit each other better with one another than those\n            of either the Public Sector Management Credit (PSMAC) or the\n            PSMAL and were not as widely dispersed as the two Former\n            Yugoslav Republic (FYR) Macedonia operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Public Sector Management\n            Adjustment Loan Project,

likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; Bank\n            performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. These lessons were cited: 1) Building on prior\n            sector work: The project clearly benefited from prior sector\n            work on public sector management issues. Much of the project\n            conditionality reflects the recommendations of these sector\n            reports. 2) A pipeline of reforms: The project also\n            benefited from the previous adjustment operation, the Public\n            Sector Management Adjustment Credit Project PSMAC, which,\n            among others, established the legislative framework for the\n            civil service reforms supported by the project. By the same\n            token, several of the first Public Sector Management\n            Adjustment Loan PSMAL reforms will be followed-up under the\n            new operations. 3) Limited number and specificity of\n            conditions The relatively small number of conditions imposed\n            under the PSMAL was a boon to implementation, as it\n            permitted the Government to focus on a limited number of\n            issues. The specificity of the reforms was also helpful, as\n            it provided clear targets for reform efforts. 4) High level\n            political support was critical to project success. Support\n            from the Ministry of Finance was instrumental in offsetting\n            internal and external opposition to reforms, particularly in\n            pharmaceutical procurement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Second Public Sector Management\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Second Public Sector\n

Adjustment\n            Loan Project is one of a series of adjustment operations,\n            aimed at improving public sector management in Macedonia.\n            The project will pursue five major areas of reform: 1)\n            budget formulation, to increase the usefulness of the budget\n            as a strategic policy instrument, and ensure that the\n            Government is capable of formulating a budget within\n            macroeconomic constraints; 2) budget execution, to\n            strengthen the Treasury's control over spending\n            commitments and extra-budgetary funds; 3) audit, to\n            establish an internal audit department in the Ministry of\n            Finance, and units in other key Government agencies, and,\n            strengthen the State Audit Office's ability to focus on\n            high risk entities; 4) procurement, to support the enactment\n            of a new procurement law, and the creation of a specialized\n            procurement bureau in the Ministry of Finance; and, 5) civil\n            service, to create a mechanism to enforce civil service\n            hiring requirements, and introduce a uniform, decompressed\n            salary structure for civil servants. In addition, the\n            project will support specific reforms in the health sector,\n            including improvements in the internal control system of the\n            Health Insurance Fund, and in the procurement of\n            pharmaceuticals. Linked donor finance will also support\n            technical assistance, and policy studies, aimed at improving\n            the administration and targeting of health insurance\n            subsidies, pension contributions, social assistance, and\n            child allowances. Political and implementation risks shall\n            be minimized, because key reforms will be completed prior to\n            Board presentation, and the inclusion of a second tranche\n            release will be contingent full compliance with reform implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Public Sector Management\n            Adjustment Loan
