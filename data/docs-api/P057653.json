Some lessons learned included: the FUNDESCOLA\n            IIIA had a clear strategy for product development, which\n            ranged from design to evaluation and dissemination of\n            products. The importance of testing and evaluating products\n            proved to be essential in the scaling up of the project. In\n            addition, the dissemination of results within Brazil and\n            beyond served to galvanize support around a school-based\n            strategy to improve quality, efficiency and learning\n            outcomes. Indeed, the federal government acknowledged the\n            proven track record of the FUNDESCOLA products was among the\n            factors that motivated them to scale up the implementation\n            of some of the products within the umbrella of the national\n            School Development Plan (PDE). The FUNDESCOLA approach to\n            strategic planning uses a bottom-up framework rather than a\n            top-down approach. This approach is central to the\n            successful implementation of the project given that behavior\n            change is more likely to take place when there is genuine\n            self-reflection on issues and local leadership to plan a way\n            forward to make changes. The FUNDESCOLA IIIA places the\n            responsibility on individual schools to identify their needs\n            and draft their own solutions, while providing products,\n            tool and reference materials to assist individual schools or\n            to technical staff providing support. The approach has now\n            taken root in Brazil and has served to galvanize federal\n            government support around it to ensure future programs are\n            guided by a bottom-up principle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Third School Improvement\n            (FUNDESCOLA IIIA) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Third School Improvement\n            (FUNDESCOLA

Second, the project will help\n            hundreds of local governments expand these reforms into\n            thousands of additional schools. Third, the project will\n            develop and use a new set of teaching/learning models, in\n            addition to Escola Ativa and Gestar, for diverse types of\n            schools and population groups. Finally, Fundescola III\n            builds the capacity of local governments to support\n            continuous improvement in schooling quality, and promote the\n            financial, administrative, and managerial permanence of\n            these reforms. Fundescola III will be implemented in two\n            phases, this being the first phase."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Fundescola IIIA (Third School\n            Improvement)
