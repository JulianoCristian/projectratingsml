The\n            road will provide all-weather access to an area of\n            considerable agricultural potential, the development of\n            which is handicapped by inadequate access. The present road\n            is closed to traffic, due to water logging, for two to four\n            months per year."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Somalia - Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Somalia - Highway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1964/12/1556860/somalia-highway-project","projn":"SO-Roads (Supplementary -- P002438","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Housing Finance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Somalia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902470973"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,balance of\n            payments,Credit Agreement,current\n            expenditures,disbursement,economic\n            development,expenditures,exploitation,exports,feasibility\n            studies,oil,savings,technical assistance"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,balance of\n            payments,Credit Agreement,current\n            expenditures,disbursement,economic\n            development,expenditures,exploitation,exports,feasibility\n            studies,oil,savings,technical assistance"}},"owner":"HQ Anchor: Ethiopia (AFCET)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P409"},"facets":{}}}
