The lessons learned\n            indicate that despite three changes of provincial Governors\n            and Ministers of Education, the provincial political and\n            educational authorities of the Province of Buenos Aires\n            provided consistent support throughout the entire project\n            cycle leading to a successful implementation of the\n            education reform in the province. The implementation of the\n            education reform in Argentina was gradual and progressive.\n            The efficient project management and implementation capacity\n            of the Project Implementation Unit was a key factor in\n            achieving project targets. The project's design and\n            implementation strategy included clear targeting criteria to\n            focus project activities in those high-risk students and\n            schools to improve the equity of the secondary education\n            system. Strategies and interventions were based on a solid\n            school-based diagnosis made by the same school stakeholders.\n            Social participation, mainly through the school's\n            cooperative association was key for the successful provision\n            of learning supplies, and completion of the entire\n            construction and rehabilitation component. Tracer studies\n            are recommended instruments to assess the impact of the\n            formal technical-professional education system on the formal\n            and non-formal labor markets with respect to the\n            employability and working performance of their graduates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

There are three\n            components in this project.  First, expansion of access\n            includes construction of classrooms for the 9th grade of the\n            new EGB3 (third cycle of basic education, from 7th to 9th\n            grade), rehabilitation of EGB (basic education) schools, and\n            construction of school bathrooms in the EGB schools.\n            Second, quality and relevance improvement will cover\n            institutional strengthening at the school level;\n            restructuring technical schools through the provision of\n            up-to-date educational resources and in-service teacher\n            training; and establishment of school-based extracurricular\n            programs for youth.
