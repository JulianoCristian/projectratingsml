Some lessons\n            learned included: it is essential that ministries of finance\n            implementing complex information and communication\n            technology (ICT) projects retain advisers with expertise in\n            managing large and complex ICT systems implementation\n            projects. Projects can be more effective if PFM reforms are\n            not linked to the implementation of the financial management\n            information system (FMIS). A realistic time frame for the\n            design and implementation of a complex FMIS project is seven\n            to eight years. Project extensions should be long enough to\n            allow the stakeholders to bring about changes in project\n            performance. The design of World Bank standard bidding\n            documents for information technology (IT) projects should be\n            reviewed to assess their suitability. Resistance to change\n            should be anticipated and the project should retain\n            consensus building and communications arrangements\n            throughout
