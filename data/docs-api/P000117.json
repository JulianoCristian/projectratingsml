Lessons convey that the strong\n            persistence, and follow-up during supervision, were the main\n            factors conducive to the progress achieved in privatization\n            (difficult to attain in light of strong vested interests),\n            and improved port management. However, there were problems\n            encountered in training small roads contractors,\n            particularly due to the lack of expertise in the subject, an\n            issue that needs to be dealt with as of the early stages.\n            Similarly, it was difficult to mobilize local counterpart\n            funding for rural road rehabilitation in the poorest areas;\n            it was at the mid-term review that it was decided to take\n            only the local labor contribution into account, increase the\n            contribution from the national budget - so as to prod\n            poverty alleviation - considering in turn, lower road\n            standards. Nonetheless, it is important to promote, and\n            develop road maintenance systems, a multifaceted effort,\n            which involves training of private contractors, and ensuring\n            access to capital, and the necessary equipment. This effort\n            was successfully achieved, demonstrating how small\n            contractors can evolve in urban areas, and how private\n            contracting can be promoted for maintaining trunk, and rural\n            roads. Most importantly, the independent road fund\n            demonstrated once again its valuable experience."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Transport Sector Investment Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin -

In rural\n            areas, the main environmental impacts and accompanying\n            mitigation measures will be:  a) laterite quarries, restored\n            by leveling the grounds, spreading back organic soil and\n            restoring vegetative cover or transformed into water\n            reservoirs;  b) wetland degradation, impacted by imbalance\n            to fragile ecosystems, loss of agricultural land use, and\n            water body eutrophication, mitigated by improved drainage\n            infrastructure resulting in the restoration of the original\n            water transfers;  c) road drainage leading to accelerated\n            formation of gullies and erosion will not have a great\n            impact, but can be mitigated by improving downstream road\n            drainage systems;  d) atmospheric pollution is negligible\n            compared to other sources of air pollution, dust will be\n            controlled by frequent watering of construction sites; and\n            e) destruction of human habitat, mitigated by compensation\n            measures.  There will be no population displacement due to\n            the project.  Urban environmental impacts are similar with\n            the addition of the risk of flooding which will be helped by\n            improved water drainage situation in urban areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Projet Sectoriel des Transports"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Projet Sectoriel des Transports"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/05/697420/benin-projet-sectoriel-des-transports","projn":"BJ-Transport Sector Investment Program -- P000117","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970716150352"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Ports, waterways and shipping,Roads and highways,Sub-national government administration","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Transport infrastructure; Road & highway\n            networks; Laterite; Wetlands; Environmental impact\n            assessment; Eutrophication; Ecology; Erosion control; Air\n            pollution; Dust; Drainage ditches; Flood control; Roads\n            & highways; Road & highway networks; Road &\n            highway safety; Road materials; Road surfaces; Transit;\n            Feeder roads; Port facilities; Airports; Transport\n            infrastructure; Transport facilitation; Nongovernmental\n            organizations; Paved roads & highways; Traffic control;\n            Rural roads"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF036251-BENIN - PRIORITY REFORMS TO THE\n            TSIP PHASE II,TF034818-BENIN - TRANSPORT SECTOR\n            INVESTMENT PROGRAM,TF023037-PHRD-TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT","repnb":"E154"},"facets":{}}}
