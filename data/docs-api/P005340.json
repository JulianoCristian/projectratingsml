Lessons learned from the project: Greater\n            beneficiary agency involvement is necessary from the outset.\n            Difficult automation project require adequate project\n            planning, especially in terms of properly identifying\n            accompanying reforms, human resource requirements, capacity\n            building requirements and other peripheral issues. There is\n            a clear correlation between lack of capacity and length of\n            implementation. No matter how simple the design and how well\n            defined the activity, building capacity for institutional\n            reforms may require a longer time frame than what is\n            generally practiced. Donor-funded enclaves of technical\n            excellence can and should be mainstreamed into the\n            traditional civil service. To enlist champions within the\n            administration, he project focused on achieving early wins\n            in highly visible areas to signal others that the old\n            processes no longer represent a venue for exercising power\n            or maintain social status.
