Project sustainability for all five\n            projects is unlikely or non-evaluable. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are adjudged as satisfactory for four\n            of the projects but unsatisfactory for the ASIP. The project\n            audits provide the building blocks for the sector review,\n            which finds impressive improvement. The projects offer six\n            main lessons: 1) Borrower capacity to provide counterpart\n            funding should be projected and realistically assessed, and\n            program design should be adjusted to match the findings of\n            that assessment. 2) There are opportunities for relatively\n            minor adjustments in project strategy and mechanisms which\n            can enhance poverty focus without risk to growth. 3)\n            Publicly funded agricultural research needs to focus not\n            simply on yield maximization but on financial profitability,\n            returns to labor, and the low input technology needs of the\n            poorer farmers. 4) to improve the efficiency of extension\n            services, a phased strategy is needed to increase the role\n            of cost recovery, private sector, community groups, and\n            nongovernmental organizations. 5) Regarding community\n            infrastructure investments, approaches that specifically\n            target the poor. 6) Likely impacts need to be addressed\n            through some form of short-term safety net."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

The main components are: (a) public sector\n            investments in agricultural extension, export promotion,\n            research, and physical infrastructure to support private\n            tree crop smallholder development, private horticulture\n            production and export, and private milling; (b) private\n            sector investments in oil palm, coffee, rubber and pineapple\n            cultivation and palm oil milling; and (c) support activities\n            for public and private institutions involved.  The oil palm\n            program involves planting and establishment of intermediate\n            technology small-scale palm oil mills; coffee extension and\n            improved planting stock supply activities will lead to\n            planting/replanting and rehabilitation of robusta coffee;\n            and the rubber program will lead to the planting of 1,200 ha\n            by outgrower smallholders.  Improved technology,\n            infrastructure and export marketing assistance will increase\n            pineapple exports and the research and technology\n            improvement components will support coffee research, and\n            pineapple and rubber technology.
