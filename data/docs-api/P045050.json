Lessons\n            learned from the project: The need for a reliable monitoring\n            and evaluation system for understanding project impact. The\n            limited availability and questionable reliability of\n            information on the project's development objectives did\n            constrain effective implementation. Implementation and\n            supervision performances could be greatly impacted by the\n            stability of key staff. As presented in the report, the\n            frequent change of key staff such as the State Project\n            Director has prevented the project from being smoothly\n            implemented and has even contributed to undermining the\n            impact of various actions. Teacher availability and\n            productivity are key ingredients for achieving overall\n            program outcomes. Greater accountability in service delivery\n            across institutional levels will be important for\n            accelerating the pace towards education outcomes. Careful\n            assessment of the motivation of key stakeholders and\n            realistically planning the capacity building required if\n            decentralization of education management is to be\n            implemented.
