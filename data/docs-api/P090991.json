     were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was high, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the absence of reform component accompanying public\n            investment is likely to result in unsustainable improvement\n            and expansion of water supply. The design of any policy,\n            program, project or financing arrangements should carefully\n            take this into account. The sub-loan agreement (SLA)\n            arrangement that focuses only on physical investments may be\n            more suitable for PEMDAs and PDAMs with relatively strong\n            capacity. The amount of investment should be adjusted\n            depending on the management capacities of the PEMDAs and\n            PDAMs. Under the decentralized environment wherein PEMDAs\n            have more responsibilities in the provision of water supply\n            services, the Central Government still continues to play a\n            role particularly in initiating sector reforms,\n            incentivizing and regulating the performance of PEMDAs.\n            While leveraging and collaboration with other programs are\n            generally beneficial as these allow projects to generate\n            opportunities for expanding financial and technical\n            resources and create greater synergy and wider impact, it is\n            important to carefully consider and define the timing,\n            resources, design and arrangements for collaboration to\n            ensure that intended objectives are met."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
