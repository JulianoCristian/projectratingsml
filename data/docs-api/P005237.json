The lessons learned\n            during the implementation indicated that the goals and\n            objectives agreed amongst the stakeholders were clearly\n            defined, using a participatory approach of all stakeholders,\n            including the local population. In the project design, the\n            function of the project manager called for international\n            expertise and experience in stat-of-the-art coastal zone\n            management to transfer knowledge to the country. Strong\n            stakeholder commitment and positive economic returns can\n            flow from investment in environmentally sound projects. The\n            project also demonstrated how demand driven interventions\n            based on an effective environmental by-laws framework with\n            stakeholder participation, can bring about effective\n            management on the environment through the active involvement\n            of all stakeholders. On-the-job training and motivational\n            tools contributed to the full integration of the managerial\n            and operational project. Well designed cost recovery\n            mechanisms will help to ensure financial sustainability.\n            Initiating a dialogue with polluters will bring about a\n            consensus and lead

conservation of its\n            unique coral reefs. Specific project objectives are to: 1)\n            develop regional collaborative mechanisms for environmental\n            management to strengthen capacity for the protection of the\n            coastal zone and marine biodiversity; 2) develop and\n            implement the legal framework and regulations for control of\n            transboundary pollution; 3) provide for safeguards against\n            oil pollution of aquifers and the marine environment; 4)\n            establish and implement guidelines for the sustainable\n            development of the coastal zone; 5) assess the effects of\n            wastewater seepage on the quality and level of the\n            transboundary groundwater table; 6) implement a plan to\n            control transboundary solid waste impacts on the marine and\n            coastal water resource systems; and 7) establish the\n            Jordanian segment of the Red Sea Marine Peace Park. The\n            project consists of the following components: 1) development\n            of regulatory and institutional framework for Gulf of Aqaba\n            environmental protection; 2) emergency assessment of oil\n            pollution hazards and of pollutants contained in Ballast and\n            Bilge water and measures to promote waste oil recovery and\n            reuse; 3) safeguarding transboundary groundwater resources\n            through groundwater monitoring and assessment of the effects\n            of wastewater seepage on the quality and level of the\n            groundwater table in the Gulf of Aqaba region; 4)\n            development of an integral marine and land-based\n            transboundary solid waste management strategy; and 5)\n            protection of globally important coral reefs - development\n            and implementation of the Jordanian Marine Park."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Gulf of Aqaba Environmental Action\n
