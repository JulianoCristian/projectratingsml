Some lessons learned\n            included: when project objectives focus on directly\n            assisting the poor, the project design should facilitate\n            identifying the poor clients and their priority needs as\n            well as sound monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to monitor\n            the progress of poverty alleviation. The Bank is in a good\n            position to deploy technical expertise for this purpose in\n            the Gambia by drawing from its extensive global experience\n            in this area. When municipal technical capacity and\n            resources to maintain asphalt roads is limited, sub-project\n            investments should consider engineering designs such as\n            interlocking paving blocks, which require minimal\n            maintenance. Also when Local Government Authority (LGA)\n            technical capacity is weak, municipalities need more\n            technical assistance and training for staff at all levels.\n            Service staff can hone basic technical skills such as those\n            needed for maintenance and record keeping, for instance. At\n            the leadership level, training of LGA managers and\n            councilors can help make them more aware of the need for\n            planning and budgeting of municipal services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia - Poverty Alleviation and Capacity\n            Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gambia - Poverty Alleviation and\n            Capacity Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/06/10797080/gambia-poverty-alleviation-capacity-building-project","projn":"GM-Poverty All & Muni Dev (Fy99) -- P057997,GM-Povrty Alleviation & Subnational Gov.\n            Cb -- P107700","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"m,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Population Policies,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Gambia, The","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20090710004706"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General education sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Project Evaluations,IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access roads, accounting, actual cost,\n            additional income, administrative support, audits, Banks,\n            basic infrastructure, basic needs, Bedrooms, beneficiaries,\n            Beneficiary, beneficiary assessment, Beneficiary\n            assessments, borrower, borrowing, BRIDGE, budgeting,\n            CAPACITY BUILDING, car, car parks, cities, commodity,\n            communities, community leaders, construction industry,\n            consulting firms, contributions, cost of capital, credits,\n            Currency, DCA, decentralization, deficits, Development Bank,\n            dissemination, drainage, drought, economic growth,\n            Employment, Employment Agency, employment creation, external\n            shocks, FAMILY PLANNING, Female, finances, financial\n            management, financial resources, financial risk, financial\n            support, focus group discussions, government departments,\n            health centers, houses, Human Development, Immigration,\n            income, income group, Information System, infrastructure\n            planning, infrastructure projects, inhabitants, Investment\n            Program, investment programs, laws, literacy, living\n            conditions, Loan, Loan amount, local authorities, local\n            capacity, Local Communities, Local Government, Local\n            Government Finance, local governments, local municipalities,\n            lower income, Management Information Systems, marketing,\n            migration, motor cycles, Municipal Development,\n            municipalities, neighborhood, neighborhoods, newsletter,\n            Nurses, O &amp;

       and should be further supported; 3) local government\n            authorities should pay adequate attention to development of\n            technical, managerial and financial capacity and should\n            receive further assistance to succeed; and 4) the Project\n            has helped local governments to meet some of their priority\n            infrastructure needs and
