Some lessons learned included:\n            Application of modern metering technology provides utilities\n            suffering from high network losses and poor collections with\n            a means of mitigating these problems. However for any\n            metering project to be effective, it will be accompanied\n            with an investment program of rehabilitation of Latvia (LV)\n            networks and feeders where the metering project is\n            implemented. Given the associated cost of modern metering\n            and network rehabilitation, utilities are advised to\n            gradually expand new metering technology in areas that will\n            yield the highest benefits as determined by a cost/benefit\n            analysis performed for the metering project. To avoid delays\n            in project implementation, adequate time and effort is\n            required to develop a suitable design for a proper metering\n            system, tender packages, the bid evaluation process, and to\n            develop a realistic plan for project implementation.\n            Significant costs will be associated with the initial stage\n            of an automatic meter reading (AMR) System project. However,\n            costs of subsequent scale up stages of the AMR system may be\n            lower due to increased implementation efficiency by utility\n            staff and the economies of

   Stabilization of Electricity Supply in the Republic of\n            Montenegro Project, is to test the viability of, and the\n            degree electric power distribution consumers demonstrate in\n            improving their payment discipline. The Project will also\n            participate in a loss reduction program in response to the\n            introduction of remote metering, automated billing, and\n            demand side management (DSM) in the pilot areas. The\n            learning expectations to be documented through this pilot\n            include the economic, and financial impacts of the\n            distribution program; the distribution of automated\n            technologies; the impact of changes on the institutional\n            capacity of the Electric Power Company of Montenegro (EPCG);\n            and, the social responsiveness to alternative service\n            practices. The two main components will: 1) provide funds\n            for the supply, and installation of equipment required for\n            the provision of remote metering, automated billing, and DSM\n            in selected areas. Technical assistance (TA) will be\n            provided for the design, procurement, training, and\n            implementation of pilot projects, as well as for monitoring\n            and evaluation; and, 2) finance the supply, and installation\n            of a computer-based management information system (MIS) in\n            EPCG, which also includes TA for its design, procurement,\n            training and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia, Federal Republic of -
