Key lessons underline\n            primarily, the timing issue regarding the impacts of\n            institutional reforms, vs. physical investments, i.e., that\n            increased traffic volumes are even higher than expected,\n            while, the results of institutional reforms, as expected,\n            are taking time, as the proposed changes need acceptance,\n            and understanding in its application. But although slower in\n            taking effect, results are increasingly steady. This extent\n            of government, and upper level management control in the\n            implementation of institutional changes, is partly\n            reaffirmed by the evidence that attempts to improve, or\n            modify current processes, required the total support of the\n            authorities, be it for facilitating new standards, for\n            identifying strategies, or adequate policies for action, or\n            even in attempting to minimize negative effects in\n            procedural changes. Nonetheless, outsourcing road\n            maintenance work to the private sector, and improvements in\n            the administration of the road network, proved not only\n            successful, but conducive to the rapid increase of paved\n            network in good conditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala -
