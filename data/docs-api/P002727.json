Tanzania. Therefore, the\n            project will finance: (a) a program to increase smallholder\n            pyrethrum production; (b) a program to strengthen pyrethrum\n            research in Tanzania; (c) the strengthening of TPB's\n            organization and infrastructure; and (d) the improvement and\n            maintenance of district and feeder roads. A risk faced by\n            the Project will be a future collapse of pyrethrum export\n            prices as a result of the development of new substitutes.\n            However, current research is aimed mostly towards developing\n            agricultural chemicals which will not compete with\n            pyrethrum. Also the costs of licensing new insecticides\n            protects pyrethrum's market position."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Pyrethrum Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Pyrethrum Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/03/726427/tanzania-pyrethrum-project","projn":"TZ-Pyrethrum -- P002727","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912480924"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            inputs,Agricultural Marketing,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Products,Agricultural\n            research,agricultural research\n            institutes,Agriculture,agronomy,alternative fuels,Audit\n            Reports,cattle,CGIAR,climatic conditions,coffee,commercial\n            value,cotton,Crop,crop production,crop\n            rotation,crops,Cultivation,dairy products,dates,development\n            projects,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic Development,Economic\n            Rate of Return,eggs,Equipment,export\n            crops,exports,extension,extension services,FAO,Farm,Farm\n            Incomes,FARMER,Farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,feed,fertilizers,fish,Flowers,food crops,food\n            grains,food\n            production,foodgrains,forestry,fruits,GDP,GNP,Grain,Grain\n            Storage,harvests,immunity,imports,Income,income\n            distribution,Incomes,insect pests,international agricultural\n            research,livestock,livestock research,Low\n            temperatures,Maize,maize production,Marketing,Ministries of\n            Agriculture,nematodes,pesticide,pests,Plant\n            propagation,pLanting,population growth,price\n            increases,produce,producer incentives,producers,production\n            activities,Production Costs,production\n            increases,replanting,resins,rice,rural development,rural\n            population,Rural roads,seed,seed production,seedlings,side\n            effects,sisal,soils,spacing,sugar,tea,technical\n            assistance,the Consultative\n            Group,tobacco,trees,UNDP,vegetables,wages,water supply,weed growth,wheat,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            inputs,Agricultural Marketing,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural Products,Agricultural\n            research,agricultural research\n            institutes,Agriculture,agronomy,alternative fuels,Audit\n            Reports,cattle,CGIAR,climatic conditions,coffee,commercial\n            value,cotton,Crop,crop production,crop\n            rotation,crops,Cultivation,dairy products,dates,development\n            projects,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic Development,Economic\n            Rate of Return,eggs,Equipment,export\n            crops,exports,extension,extension services,FAO,Farm,Farm\n            Incomes,FARMER,Farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,feed,fertilizers,fish,Flowers,food crops,food\n            grains,food\n            production,foodgrains,forestry,fruits,GDP,GNP,Grain,Grain\n            Storage,harvests,immunity,imports,Income,income\n            distribution,Incomes,insect pests,international agricultural\n            research,livestock,livestock research,Low\n            temperatures,Maize,maize production,Marketing,Ministries of\n            Agriculture,nematodes,pesticide,pests,Plant\n            propagation,pLanting,population growth,price\n            increases,produce,producer incentives,producers,production\n            activities,Production Costs,production\n            increases,replanting,resins,rice,rural development,rural\n            population,Rural roads,seed,seed production,seedlings,side\n            effects,sisal,soils,spacing,sugar,tea,technical\n            assistance,the Consultative\n            Group,tobacco,trees,UNDP,vegetables,wages,water supply,weed growth,wheat,Yields"}},"owner":"WB Off:DaresSalaam-Eastern AFR 1 (AFCE1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"2749"},"facets":{}}}
