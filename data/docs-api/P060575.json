the\n            foundations for improved growth, poverty reduction, and\n            public service delivery by improving a) aggregate fiscal\n            performance through incentives for fiscal responsibilities,\n            and b) the use of public resources, through better\n            allocation and technical efficiency of expenditures,\n            including better service delivery to Brazil's citizens\n            and improved debt management. The program consists of series\n            of actions undertaken during a two-year period 2001-2002 to\n            improve fiscal performance. The actions cover implementation\n            of the Fiscal Stability Plan and the Law of Fiscal\n            Responsibility (LFR); upgrading of the federal financial\n            management system, development of the federal multi-annual\n            expenditure plan framework, completion of administrative\n            reform, and implementation of a program to bring Federal\n            debt institutions closer to best practice. The project will\n            bring about the following benefits: a) continued aggregate\n            fiscal balance; b) improved fiscal planning, transparency,\n            and performance incentives; c) an improved federal financial\n            management system; d) improved incentives for civil service\n            performance; e) a long term expenditure framework; f)\n            improved delivery of public services to Brazilian citizens;\n            and g) quality of debt management raised to international\n            best practice for large open economies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Programmatic Fiscal Reform\n            Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Programmatic Fiscal\n
