The specific objectives and the scope of\n            the project were to: (a) improve water supply in three large\n            urban towns (Coimbatore, Madurai and Salem) and provide safe\n            water supply to a number of smaller towns and rural areas\n            without these facilities; (b) provide proper low-cost\n            sanitation (LCS) facilities to selected urban communities to\n            improve public health standards; (c) assist the Government\n            of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) and the implementing agency, the Tamil\n            Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD), in developing\n            water resources management strategies aimed at achieving\n            overall economies in providing drinking water; (d) enable\n            low-income groups to connect to the systems, or\n            alternatively to provide adequate standpost facilities; (e)\n            strengthen TWAD's institutional, managerial and\n            financial practices through training and technical\n            assistance; and, (f) assist urban local bodies in improving\n            their resource base for proper operation and maintenance of\n            installed facilities. The Bank's performance in\n            identification, was generally satisfactory. The borrower\n            complied with all covenants, sometimes after initial delays,\n            except in taking suitable measures to control the\n            exploitation of groundwater. The key lessons learned were as\n            follows: This project was insufficiently prepared at\n            appraisal, and was too complex for the agency to implement\n            in an efficient manner without greater external support in\n            the early years. These deficiencies, of preparation and\n            early implementation, account for much of the delay and cost\n            overrun. The Bank should normally seek the implementation of\n            administrative reforms which involve greater delegations to\n            field and other operational staff at least prior to credit\n            effectiveness. The implementing agency (TWAD) did not have\n            adequate incentives, in the form of penalties or rewards, to\n            perform according to the agreed programs of preparation and\n            implementation. The Bank needs to be prepared to rigorously\n            enforce timely completion of dated covenants. Government\n            rates for cost estimating purposes were found to be\n            unreliable, tending to underestimate true costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Tamil Nadu Water Supply and\n
