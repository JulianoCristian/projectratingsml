World Bank\n            performance is considered unsatisfactory, although Bank\n            management and staff were very responsive in giving good\n            quality sector advise and in providing assistance to resolve\n            project implementation issues in a timely manner. Borrower\n            performance overall was also unsatisfactory despite\n            Government cooperation because unfamiliarity with Bank\n            policies, guidelines and procedures, and conflicts between\n            these conditions and Iranian laws and administrative\n            procedures, obstructed senior Government officials to take\n            timely actions to expedite project implementation. Lessons\n            learned were described broadly as recognizing the need for\n            rigorous sector analysis where Bank knowledge of a sector is\n            minimal as well as rigorous institutional and capacity\n            analysis at all levels of implementation; and being willing\n            to invest adequate resources. Some specific lessons focused\n            on involving all key partners in project preparation; and\n            developing a sound project implementation plan owned by the\n            Borrower for each component while building capacity of\n            counterpart staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran -

RHCs constitute the\n            cornerstone of the Iranian health care delivery system in\n            rural areas. They provide comprehensive Primary Health Care\n            (PHC) services and are essential to the development and\n            operation of outreach services. The project will provide the\n            necessary civil works, equipment and furniture, transport\n            facilities, training and salaries to establish 623 RHCs in\n            14 provinces. The project will assist in rapidly expanding\n            the Government's family planning program and\n            strengthening its institutional base. Services will be\n            provided through the primary health care network. The family\n            planning component will have four parts: (1) diversifying\n            the contraceptive method mix and expanding family planning\n            services; (2) building the Ministry's institutional\n            capacity at central and provincial levels to plan, manage\n            and deliver family planning services; (3) developing\n            information-education-communication capabilities to reach\n            target groups; and (4) establishing a capacity for program\n            evaluation and research in family planning through the use\n            of specific studies. The project will examine the fee\n            structure, the private sector role in tertiary care, and\n            establishing a national medical insurance scheme."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran -
