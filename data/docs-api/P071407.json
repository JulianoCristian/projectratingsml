The\n            project's strategic choice was to build capacity of\n            Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) mainly at park and regional\n            management level and not to provide support for policy,\n            legal or institutional reforms at ZAWA Head Quarter (HQ)\n            level. A Project Development Objective (PDO) dependent on\n            the streamlining of licenses that required legislative\n            reforms to achieve outcome indicators without any proper\n            risk mitigation measures was risky and reflecting poor\n            project design. Legislative reforms in most cases are\n            outside the control of a project, especially where they\n            result in loss of discretionary power for the agency\n            responsible under the law. The project should have used the\n            restructuring process to refine the PDO, change outcome\n            indicators and put into place more effective measures to\n            mitigate
