It was never declared effective because the reform\n            program in Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBH) (affecting two\n            thirds of the loan) was not fully implemented in the\n            aftermath of the Board approval. Once it became clear that\n            the efforts to restructure the operation in late 2005/ early\n            2006 would not succeed, SOSAC II was allowed to expire at\n            the end of June 2006 after the extended effectiveness\n            deadline was not met. SOSAC II had a troubled history almost\n            from the very beginning. The operation was originally\n            negotiated in 2002. However, the Government authorities\n            failed to sign the Minutes of Negotiations and the project\n            could not be presented to the Board in June 2002. The\n            Minutes of Negotiation were signed in April 2004 and the\n            operation was presented to and approved by the Board in June\n            2004. However, there was further delay because the operation\n            failed to get ratified by the Parliament of FBH. Final\n            efforts to reinvigorate the process to enable the operation\n            to be declared effective did not succeed as the Bank and the\n            Government could not reach agreement on the medium-term\n            expenditure framework for social assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

This is consistent with broader\n            efforts to reduce public spending and focus it on priority\n            needs, and to address regional imbalances within each\n            Entity. These objectives are key elements of the recently\n            approved Medium Term Development Strategy (PRSP).\n            Specifically, the priority program goals are to: (1) ensure\n            that protection for disabled veterans and survivor families\n            is better focused on the most disabled, while gradually\n            reducing public spending on veterans' programs; (2)\n            improve the impact and efficiency of the social safety net\n            for the poorest, in particular social welfare benefits and\n            services, including a strengthened role for the\n            non-government sector; (3) consolidate an appropriate\n            institutional structure for employment services at State and\n            Entity levels, and reorient active labor policies to\n            increase cost effectiveness, transparency and employment\n            outcomes; (iv) improve the efficiency and equity of pension\n            and disability programs, including pensions policy\n            harmonization between the Entities of BH; and (v) ensure\n            that social policy reforms are done on the basis of better\n            information, within the system and to the public, and that\n            living standards monitoring is  more effective and timely."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Second Social\n            Sector Adjustment
