Some lessons learned includes: the\n            participatory planning process needs to be adapted to its\n            purpose: in the case of 'basic needs', short cuts\n            can produce a list of priority investments very quickly. In\n            the 'once for all' approach of the project, many\n            people seeing an investment delivered in 2011 could not make\n            the connection with the diagnostic in which they had\n            participated in 2005. Making information accessible to all\n            is a key element in the participatory process. The criteria\n            for choosing amongst competing claims should be set from the\n            outset, but then the decisions themselves should be\n            entrusted to a transparent and open local governance\n            mechanism. The use of consultants might be best limited to\n            areas requiring specialist expertise such as: supervision of\n            the diagnostic phase; formation of a strategic vision; or\n            in-depth technical studies. The experience of the project\n            (and its sister irrigation-based project) suggests that, at\n            least for basic services (education, health, water supply),\n            the value added of the integrated approach compared to the\n            sectoral approach is questionable, especially considering\n            the difficulties related to coordination between different\n            ministries. Government and Bank should maintain continuous\n            dialogue and strive to re-engineer operations to test new\n            approaches within new strategic contexts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
