The assistance rendered by\n            the World Bank since 1996 gave an appreciable impetus to the\n            sector development. One of these financial aids concerned\n            implementation of key economic reforms in the agrarian\n            sector. To provide such aid, a project was developed\n            entitled agriculture sector adjustment loan. Its resources\n            were used to carry out land reform, to restructure\n            agricultural enterprises, to privatize, and de-monopolize\n            agro-industrial enterprises, as well as to liberalize\n            internal and external trade, and to finance the critical\n            import needs. The seeds development project helped improve\n            the situation in the area of seed production and develop its\n            competitiveness. The rural finance project objective was to\n            facilitate the development of effectively operating and\n            competitive rural regions, and to improve the living\n            standards of the rural population. In June 2003, the World\n            Bank approved the decision to extend a loan in the amount of\n            United States (U.S.) 195 million dollars for implementing\n            the rural land titling and cadastre development project for\n            Ukraine. The World Bank supported land reform as a priority\n            component of economic transformations that are taking place\n            in the Ukrainian agrarian sector. The activities envisaged\n            by the project are aimed at a fair distribution of land\n            plots among farmers, consolidating of their ownership rights\n            to land by issuing respective state land titles on a\n            free-of-charge basis, as well as the development of a land\n            lease market, which is to contribute to improving the living\n            standards of the rural population. The project will focus\n            much attention to informing the population on the work\n            carried out and the significance of land reform on the\n            whole. Furthermore, additional funds will be allocated to\n            purchase required equipment for agrarian universities in the\n            cities of Odesa, Lviv, Kharkiv, and Kyiv."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects in agriculture"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects in agriculture"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955632/world-bank-projects-agriculture","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural produce, agricultural\n            producers, Agriculture, Bank loan, Cadastre, distribution of\n            land, domestic market, equipment, farmers, financial\n            institutions, financial intermediaries, issuance, land\n            ownership, Land reform, land title, land titles, Land\n            Titling, land-management, landholders, living standards,\n            Loan, long-term capital, mortgage, mortgage finance, movable\n            assets, movable property, Rural, rural areas, rural economy,\n            Rural Finance, rural financing, rural population, rural\n            regions, rural workers, social protection, universities"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Trade and integration,Environment and natural resource management,Economic management,Financial and private sector development,Rule of law","topic":"Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962,Agriculture Technology m1326423 1950,Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170","projn":"UA-Agricultural Seed Development Project -- P009117,UA-Agriculture Secal -- P009113,UA-Rural Land Titling & Cadastre\n            Development Project -- P035777","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Regional Economic Development,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204154643"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Agro-industry,Agricultural extension and research,Housing finance,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","theme":"Export development and competitiveness,Land administration and management,Other economic management,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Legal institutions for a market economy,Personal and property rights,Rural markets,Other rural development,Regulation and competition policy","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962,Agriculture Technology m1326423 1950,Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","F","B"],"trustfund":"TF029341-PHRD - LAND REGISTRATION &\n            AGRI.

To meet the project's short term objective\n            of improving the supply of quality seed for the domestic and\n            export market, the project will provide financial and\n            technical assistance for: 1) the development of three\n            private enterprises specializing in the multiplication of\n            domestic and imported parent hybrid seed for maize,\n            sunflower, sugarbeet, and their processing and marketing;\n            and b) the germplasm maintenance and development for three\n            leading domestic suppliers of hybrid maize, sunflower, and\n            sugarbeet seed. To help meet the project's medium term\n            objective of developing a competitive seed system, the\n            project will provide financial and technical assistance for:\n            1) improving the regulatory framework for the seed system;\n            2) the development of an agricultural research strategy and\n            plan; and 3) the Ukrainian Institute for Agro-Ecology and\n            Biotechnology. In addition to these specific interventions\n            in the seed system, the liberalization of seed pricing,\n            marketing, and trade implemented within the context of the\n            Government's economic reform program, will establish\n            the enabling policy environment to enhance the efficiency of\n            the national seed system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine -
