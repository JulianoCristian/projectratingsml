Health safety and\n            environmental implications need particular attention in\n            emergency projects such as Fertilizer Support Project (FSP)\n            since their rushed implementation schedule often does not\n            allow for mitigation plans to be put in place before\n            implementation.

Some lessons\n            learned included: Ethiopia has no explicit fertilizer\n            subsidies and reforms are reducing credit guarantees and\n            encouraging farmers to purchase fertilizer on a cash basis.\n            During the project, field evidence and impact evaluation\n            data from the project indicate that the large majority of\n            farmers used cash to purchase fertilizer, and only in\n            exceptional circumstances did local administrations support\n            new credit guarantees. Experience under the project\n            confirmed the ability and willingness of many small holders\n            to pay cash for fertilizer. Under the project, a parastatal\n            enterprise became the single importer of fertilizer in\n            Ethiopia.' It remains the monopoly importer; through\n            the procedures introduced under the project make this\n            position contestable. Currently no evidence suggested that\n            the single importer had measurable negative effects on\n            fertilizer prices or distribution efficiency. On the other\n            hand, economies of scale effects in the procurement and\n            importation of fertilizer are small beyond certain amounts\n            (50,000 tons) and therefore do
