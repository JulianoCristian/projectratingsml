However, lessons indicate that when\n            the project was extended, foreseeing that the capacity of\n            the Malawi Rural Finance Company (MRFC) was not attainable\n            as a private bank, the project should have instead been\n            restructured, in line with current conditions, and allow for\n            an opportunity to assist the Government in pursuing improved\n            policy, and institutional frameworks. Furthermore, since the\n            issue of rural finance, in an agriculturally-based economy\n            as Malawi's is a highly political one, efforts to\n            strengthen relations among the Government, its agencies,\n            donors ant the private sector at large, need to be pursued,\n            since MRFC activities were seen only as a Bank project. This\n            would in turn enable macroeconomic stability, and develop\n            commercial financial institutions, viable to financial\n            services, that include both savings, and credit facilities\n            to the rural population. But the capacity of rural financial\n            institutions needs to be revisited, focusing on issues of\n            loan recovery mechanisms, efficient marketing systems,\n            subsidy elements, and furthermore, financial institutions\n            lending for agricultural purposes, need to create reserves\n            for default, resulting from the risks of macroeconomic\n            instability. Licensing these institutions under the\n            country's banking legislation, would enable supervision accordingly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Rural Financial Services

- Rural Financial Services Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project's fundamental objective\n            is to improve the access to financial services for the rural\n            sector, including women, on a sustainable basis.  This will\n            be done by corporatizing and converting the Smallholder\n            Agricultural Credit Administration (SACA) into a limited\n            liability finance company, thus eliminating its heavy\n            dependence on government support, as a first step to its\n            subsequent conversion into a private bank.  The project will\n            also assist the government toward improving the policy and\n            institutional framework for rural financial intermediation\n            by supporting the development of linkages between the formal\n            and informal financial sectors, and strengthening related\n            non-financial institutions serving the rural sector.  The\n            project has three main components. The first component,\n            institution-building, will support:  (a) the corporatization\n            and conversion of SACA, which is currently a government\n            department, into a limited liability finance company with\n            publicly held shares and capable of providing a full range\n            of financial services (for farm and non-farm activities) to\n            the rural population on a commercial basis; and (b) use of\n            Development of Malawi Trades Trust (DEMATT) to assist in\n            preparing investment proposals for agricultural and micro-,\n            small- and medium-scale enterprises, and to provide related\n            training and advisory services. The second component, line\n            of credit, will finance primarily short term loan\n            requirements of farm and non-farm rural activities.

This will\n            be done by corporatizing and converting the Smallholder\n            Agricultural Credit Administration (SACA) into a limited\n            liability finance company, thus eliminating its heavy\n            dependence on government support, as a first step to its\n            subsequent conversion into a private bank.  The project will\n            also assist the government toward improving the policy and\n            institutional framework for rural financial intermediation\n            by supporting the development of linkages between the formal\n            and informal financial sectors, and strengthening related\n            non-financial institutions serving the rural sector.  The\n            project has three main components. The first component,\n            institution-building, will support:  (a) the corporatization\n            and conversion of SACA, which is currently a government\n            department, into a limited liability finance company with\n            publicly held shares and capable of providing a full range\n            of financial services (for farm and non-farm activities) to\n            the rural population on a commercial basis; and (b) use of\n            Development of Malawi Trades Trust (DEMATT) to assist in\n            preparing investment proposals for agricultural and micro-,\n            small- and medium-scale enterprises, and to provide related\n            training and advisory services.
