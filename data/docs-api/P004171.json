The overall\n            borrower performance was satisfactory, with an impressive\n            performance by project institutions, erasing an early\n            \"unsatisfactory\" rating, related to a delayed\n            legal covenant compliance. It is therefore interesting to\n            note, as a lesson to be learned, that good working\n            relationships, stemming from frequent and detailed\n            supervision, combined with
