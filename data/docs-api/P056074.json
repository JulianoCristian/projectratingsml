The Bali Urban\n            Infrastructure Project also had a moderately satisfactory\n            outcome but its institutional development impact is\n            substantial. The Municipal Innovations Project had a\n            satisfactory outcome with modest institutional development\n            impact. All three projects have unlikely sustainability. The\n            performances of the Bank and the Borrower for all three\n            projects were satisfactory.  Experience with the three\n            projects suggests the following lessons: 1) Local\n            governments should continue to build upon their demonstrated\n            capacity to improve infrastructure delivery, but need to be\n            more responsive to urban development needs expressed through\n            local community participation. 2) A cross-sector framework,\n            such as the Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development\n            Program (IUIDP), can work well for local governments,\n            provided the investment resources within it are sufficiently\n            concentrated to adequately address needs in all included\n            sectors. 3) All stakeholders, including local governments\n            themselves, need to agree and clearly understand the purpose\n            behind local innovations - be it to increase efficiency, to\n            increase client-responsiveness. 4) The Bank should ensure\n            that local governments are always included as partners, as\n            it continues to emphasize improving their performance in\n            service delivery. 5) Monitoring and Evaluation systems need\n            to be designed and implemented to track outcomes related to\n            project objectives, as well as the inputs and outputs of\n            project activities that will help achieve these outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

Municipal Innovations Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the project are as\n            follows: the project outcome is satisfactory, the\n            project's sustainability is likely, the institutional\n            development impact is modest, and the Bank and Borrower\n            performance are both satisfactory. Among the several lessons\n            learned from this project are the following: 1. The\n            political will of government officials to put the objective\n            of serving the public above all else is the most important\n            fundamental element affecting the willingness to innovate\n            and to carry out innovation.   2. Creating an enabling\n            environment and a degree of freedom conducive for empowering\n            local institutions and officials is more effective than the\n            provision of mere technical skills and the introduction of\n            new innovative approaches. 3. Part of the conducive\n            environment needed for successful innovations are flexible\n            procedures. 4. The personal commitment of political leaders\n            and the personal integrity of the managers concerned with an\n            innovation effort are crucial for its success. 5. Even\n            though central government had grown accustomed to a\n            top-down, more instructive management style, there was a\n            readiness to change to a more facilitating work style. 6.\n            Competition, transparency and recognition turned out to be\n            effective vehicles to promote local government willingness\n            to innovate; an added supporting factor was the central\n            government grants which reduced the financial risk. 7. There\n            is a need to enhance the capacity of central government to\n            better manage Bank-supported projects. 8. Adequate\n            consultation with the ultimate subproject beneficiaries is\n            one of the most important keys for a subproject's\n            success and sustainability.. 9. Projects focusing on\n            changing mindsets must focus on enhancing capacities and\n            commitment for innovations during preparation. 10. The sense\n            of entrepreneurship among local government is still weak.\n            11. Institutional adjustments are not feasible without a\n            willingness to take certain risks and accept additional\n            costs, at least initially. 12. innovations are more likely\n            to be successfully implementable where they are not in\n            conflict with vested interests of segments of the\n            bureaucracy and do not touch fields where the collection of\n            fees is a key issue. 13. The success of subprojects depends\n            not only on the personal qualities (like competence and\n            commitment) of the main actors but also on their position\n            within the responsible agencies and on an environment that\n            is conducive for innovation and change. 14. Revolving funds\n            cannot work if the groups who receive the funds first are\n            inconsiderate of the needs of the other groups who need\n            funding assistance, if repayment terms are not entirely\n            clear, and if the fund managers do not enjoy the full trust\n            of the beneficiaries. 15. Direct communication among local\n            governments, involving real-life examples and experience\n            shared among them, promote innovations. 16. The improvement\n            of documentation and the dissemination of the lessons\n            learned from the project promote a culture of innovation and\n            replication. 17. The will to innovate is stimulated, and\n            innovations are more likely to be successful, if central and\n            local governments share a political commitment to creating\n            an enabling environment and effecting the necessary changes\n            of regulations and arrangements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Municipal Innovations
