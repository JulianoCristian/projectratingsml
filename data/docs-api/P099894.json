The risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; the Bank's performance was satisfactory; and\n            the borrower's performance was moderately satisfactory.\n            Restructuring is necessary for the following two reasons:\n            (i) to reflect the Government\u0092s new priorities with regard\n            to the absorption of European Union (EU) funds and; (ii) to\n            improve project implementation performance. Key changes\n            included: (i) reduction in the scope of rehabilitation works\n            under Component 1 and borrower\u0092s financing share; (ii)\n            expansion of Component 2: Institutional Development -\n            focusing it on the absorption of EU funds; (iii) extension\n            of the Loan Closing Date by 24 months to enable full\n            completion of the expanded Component 2 and of all ongoing\n            road rehabilitation works under Component 1. Lessons learned\n            include, 1) the project needs to include the design and\n            supervision under the activities funded by the loan; 2) the\n            ureaucratic processing timeline needs to be mitigated with\n            clear commitments in advance; 3) the organizational\n            stability of the Borrower lends to the advantage of\n            independently managing Bank projects and its own resources\n            without political interference; 4) early training on FIDIC\n            & World Bank procurement guidelines; 5) adopting a\n            twin-training approach when implementing RMS for the first\n            time; 6) road safety value engineering at the design review\n            stage is very effective in enhancing road safety and adding\n            additional socio-economic benefits to projects; and 7)\n            adopting hybrid rehabilitation and maintenance contracts\n            using both traditional and performancebased contracting methodology."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Road Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Road Infrastructure\n
