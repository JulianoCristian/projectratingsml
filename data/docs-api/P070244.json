Some lessons learned included:\n            the Project Development Objective (PDO) was formulated at a\n            time when Private Sector Participation (PSP)-oriented reform\n            was considered the main tool for improving utility\n            performance and sector reform. At that time, many projects\n            in the Water and Sanitation Sector (WSS) sector included PSP\n            as a development objective, with the ultimate involvement of\n            the private sector as a key indicator for success. This\n            raises an issue with this particular generation of projects\n            that can be considered in the future design of projects\n            seeking to involve the private sector in its implementation,\n            particularly in Technical Assistance Loan (TAL): government\n            ownership and commitment to a specific service provision\n            model, unless there is strong consensus and leadership from\n            the onset- cannot be guaranteed during political changes\n            within a reasonable project implementation period of five\n            years, and experience shows that deep sector reforms can\n            take much longer to mature. In this context, PDO for\n            technical assistance projects could be formulated more in\n            line with achievable goals within the control of the project\n            (fostering stakeholder support, providing solid analytical\n            and technical tools and studies, and others), and a\n            programmatic approach to support sector reform could also be\n            considered. Another lesson learned for future project design\n            is to try to maximize the opportunity to influence sector\n            reform by establishing meaningful links with investment\n            projects. Whilst in this case, the approval of the\n            Bank's Water Sector Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            Project in 2005 initially fostered a re-engagement of the\n            dialogue, it could be argued that it perhaps reduced the\n            urgency for investments and thus the incentive for reforming\n            the broader model for service provision, which will\n            ultimately guarantee the sustainability of the sector.\n            Greater coordination or dialogue between the World Bank and\n            the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) during project\n            supervision may have improved project outcomes and perhaps\n            corrected to some degree implementation difficulties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Saint Lucia - Water Sector Reform Technical\n

There are\n            five project components. The first provides technical\n            assistance for the strengthening of the regulatory and\n            environmental framework by reviewing the Water Act and other\n            key legislation, drafting regulations, outlining the new\n            operating license, and training staff, among other\n            activities. The second component funds technical assistance\n            to strengthen the management information systems, financial\n            management and accounting systems, and customer service and\n            operations for the water and sewerage company (WASCO).

Water Sector Reform Project St.\n            Lucia, which improves the institutional performance of the\n            water and sewerage sector. Temporary environmental impacts\n            and their mitigation measures are as follows: Disruption of\n            recreational, commercial, and industrial activities\n            including the destruction of crops in the path of pipelines\n            will be minimized by coordinating the construction schedule\n            with local stakeholders, and providing temporary access to\n            relevant facilities. Traffic will be managed by developing\n            detour routes, limiting construction during peak tourist\n            season, restricting delivery times and places, protecting\n            walkways and safeguarding trenches, repairing and\n            maintaining all surface damage to roads. Noise pollution and\n            vibration will be controlled by maintaining mechanical\n            equipment, and avoiding construction at night and on\n            weekends. Dust and silt on properties adjacent to\n            construction will reduced by damping down areas and using\n            wheel cleaners for construction vehicles. Air pollution will\n            be mitigated by maintaining construction vehicles and\n            minimizing their movement. Reinstate cleared land and\n            maintain vegetative cover on reinstated land. Steps will be\n            taken to avoid the accidental destruction of archaeological\n            sites during construction. Spills and leaks will be\n            expeditiously cleaned and clean-up materials disposed in a landfill."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia - Technical Assistance Water\n            Sector Reform
