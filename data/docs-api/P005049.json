The project objectives were\n            to: (i) promote increased agricultural productivity through\n            introduction of appropriate farm technology, including farm\n            machinery services, to farmers in the seven rice-growing\n            governorates in the Nile Delta; (ii) assist in the\n            modernization of the national seed industry; and (iii)\n            improve the efficiency of the agriculture credit system. The\n            Bank performed satisfactorily in project supervision.\n            Although the Project experienced long implementation delays\n            and required major restructuring, the overall assessment is\n            that it was satisfactory in the achievement of its\n            development objectives. The Project provides a number of\n            important lessons: (a) Keep it Simple: Projects need to be\n            kept simple, and in line with administrative capacity. (b)\n            Parallelism Among Donors: In appraising and supervising\n            development credit projects, attention needs to be paid to\n            the competitiveness of the lending terms. (c) Understand the\n            Risks. (d) Check the Regulations.
