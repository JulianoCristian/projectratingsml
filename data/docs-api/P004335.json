For both projects, the project outcome is rated\n            highly satisfactory. Institutional development is rated\n            substantial, and project sustainability is likely. World\n            Bank performance is rated satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance is rated highly satisfactory. A number of\n            lessons were confirmed by these experiences. Although\n            oft-repeated, it remains a truism that government commitment\n            is critical for success. Projects often have components\n            involving multiple ministries, but these can be successfully\n            implemented when there is a strong stakeholder commitment to\n            reform and when there is political and administrative\n            commitment to setting and achieving high-quality standards.\n            Second, beside academic qualifications, criteria for\n            awarding fellowships should include work experience and\n            activities indicating leadership ability. Third, while using\n            well-trained and dedicated teachers as supervisors may\n            significantly promote high achievement, it takes them out of\n            the classroom and may undermine the purpose. Fourth,\n            suitable incentives are needed to create a pool of qualified\n            and effective teachers. Fifth, fellowship programs need\n            components of cost recovery, clear prioritizing of local\n            needs, and clear selection criteria to raise the\n            population's confidence level regarding the\n            impartiality of selections made. Sixth, training abroad may\n            be more economical and efficient."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - The First and Second Education\n            and Training

Some lessons learned included:  a\n            responsive national training and fellowship program should\n            be better linked to economic priorities and should include\n            private sector opportunities. The project has positively\n            influenced a reduction on expatriate staff employed within\n            the public sector. Community involvement in the planning and\n            operation of a new a toll school increases commitment and\n            assists with the resolution of arising problems. The formula\n            of using periodic implementation consultants was more\n            economical and a good approach for the on the-job training\n            of project implementation unit (PIU) staff.
