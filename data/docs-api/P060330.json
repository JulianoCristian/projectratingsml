The third component strengthens the DoM's\n            mineral tenements management by conducting field\n            assessments, and developing a database. The fourth component\n            develops project coordination and environmental assessment\n            capacity for sustainable development in mining project\n            areas. The fifth and sixth components fund institutional\n            strengthening for the geological survey and develop\n            geological information system capabilities; and implement\n            new institutional arrangements for the IRC as well as\n            upgrade equipment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Mining Sector\n            Institutional Strengthening Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Papua New Guinea - Mining Sector\n            Institutional Strengthening Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/05/437222/papua-new-guinea-mining-sector-institutional-strengthening-technical-assistance-project","projn":"PG-Mining Sector Inst.
