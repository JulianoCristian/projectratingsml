The lessons learned\n            indicate that the lack of core measurable outcome indicators\n            can detract implementation activities from core objectives\n            with the danger of becoming more narrowly focused on\n            implementation of component outputs rather than on overall\n            project development outcomes. The simpler the project the\n            easier the implementation. There is often a danger of\n            designing a project which requires capacity levels far\n            higher than exists in the beneficiary country with the\n            assumption that it will be built up during the project.\n            Delaying design issues for project implementation simply\n            delays implementation and impact. Policy change is often\n            politically sensitive, with the losers of policy change\n            often the more powerful and well connected, hence arguments\n            for change need to be clear and convincing with broad\n            consultation to ensure reform and to prevent reversal. The\n            relatively limited potential of agriculture in Lesotho,\n            particularly in its contribution to overall economic growth,\n            should be clearly recognized in the development objectives\n            of future programs. A clear monitoring framework to guide\n            decisions on project restructuring should be established,\n            with continued management oversight."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -
