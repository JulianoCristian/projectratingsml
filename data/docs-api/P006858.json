The project's main objectives were\n            to: (i) increase the incomes of about 280,000 poor farmers\n            and fishermen; (ii) improve living standards of the rural\n            communities through provision of basic infrastructure; (iii)\n            promote grassroots involvement of rural communities in the\n            identification of investment needs and subsequent\n            maintenance; and (iv)strengthen DRI's capabilities to\n            prepare, appraise and supervise projects. The RDIP's\n            outcome is judged satisfactory. The Bank's overall\n            performance was satisfactory. The overall performance of the\n            Government (Borrower) and Fondo DRI (Implementing Agency) is\n            judged deficient. Some key lessons of the RDIP are as\n            follows: 1) a participatory and decentralized operation\n            which is to finance many small projects in a large number of\n            localities, cannot work if it is overburdened by\n            bureaucratic, centralized rules which characterize normal\n            operations of the Colombian Government and World Bank; 2) a\n            flexible, open design is needed for centrally managed\n            programs targeted to local; 3) the process of designing this\n            type of operation should be highly participatory; 4) a\n            simple monitoring and control system should be in place from\n            the start in this type of operation in order to rapidly\n            identify and correct problems; 5) it is advisable to\n            separate monitoring and evaluation functions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Rural Development Investment\n            Program
