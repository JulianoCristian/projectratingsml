Rio the Janeiro State Reform\n            Privatization Loan: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development was\n            modest, the Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            the borrower performance was satisfactory.

The major lessons of general applicability\n            from the five loans assessed include: Continuity of Bank\n            interventions is important for promoting lasting\n            institutional change. Sub-national programmatic loans offer\n            advantages, in this respect, over time-bound State Reform\n            Loan (SRLs). The principles of the Levy Report remain\n            relevant for designing financial sector lending operations.\n            Credit lines (financial intermediary loans) are unlikely to\n            be appropriate instruments for supporting financial sector\n            adjustment. Reconciling project expenditures fully and\n            correctly at closing is a core Bank responsibility. An\n            oversight agency operating within an appropriate regulatory\n            framework is an important prerequisite to successful\n            privatization of public services. As investment loans, the\n            SRLs proved to be cumbersome instruments for supporting\n            structural change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Public Sector Management, Private\n

achieved\n            most of its major privatization objective and has\n            established a supportive regulatory framework. The main\n            lessons include the following: 1) Privatizing or liquidating\n            a state bank requires sustained political commitment at the\n            highest level of state government. 2) Unless necessary,\n            splitting should be avoided, as dealing with the\n            \"remnants\" to be liquidated carry a large\n            administrative and legal burden for the state after\n            privatization. 3) It is essential to identify and deal\n            up-front with the problem of hidden liabilities,\n            particularly unfunded pension liabilities. 4) Private\n            management contracts are useful to prepare a bank for\n            privatization when years of bad management and poor records\n            make valuation and the identification of hidden liabilities\n            difficult. Remuneration of the private manager based on\n            incremental operational results is an effective incentive to\n            good management. 5) Success fees expressed as a percentage\n            of privatization proceeds are a good incentive to proper\n            valuation of the minimum price and active sale promotion. 6)\n            Governments should avoid as much as possible granting\n            exclusivity rights to the management of state accounts to\n            former public banks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rio de Janeiro State Reform\n            Privatization

the state's privatization and concession\n            program, and increase efficiency in the delivery of urban\n            transport and utility services.  During preparation, the aim\n            has been to improve the quality of the design of the\n            state's privatization and concession program and assist\n            in its initial phase of implementation.  The project itself\n            will ensure that implementation is completed as planned.\n            The components of the project are the following: 1)\n            privatization of BANERJ SA and of BANERJ Insurance SA as\n            well as liquidation of Banco do Estado do Rio de Janeiro SA\n            and of its pension fund; 2) establishment of a new\n            regulatory framework for the private provision of public\n            services; 3) concession of the services of Rio's main\n            urban transport agencies and divestiture of their\n            non-operational assets; 4) privatization of the energy\n            companies--the electricity company CERJ and the gas company\n            CEG; 5) concession of water and sanitation services; and 6)\n            satisfactory review of the 1997 fiscal performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rio de Janeiro State\n            Reform-Privatization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Rio de
