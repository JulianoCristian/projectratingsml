Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) social funds continue to be relevant as\n            instruments for maximizing the development impact through\n            reaching remote communities which are underserved by\n            government institutions and the NGO sector for different\n            reasons as lack of capacity or difficult outreach,\n            especially in post-conflict situations when different donors\n            provide resources requiring community level needs assessment\n            and participation in all stages of the projects cycle; 2)\n            the community social infrastructure investments cannot be\n            sustainable, especially in the long run if they are not\n            incorporated a priori in local government development\n            strategies and coordinated with line ministries; 3)\n            maximizing the developmental impact requires that the social\n            fund type of interventions are integrated well in the\n            government policy making process; and 4) maximizing the\n            developmental impact requires that interventions align\n            capital investments with capacity building, testing,\n
