agroindustries, with technical\n            assistance to strengthen the banks' lending programs,\n            (ii) for the replacement of the municipal slaughterhouses in\n            Cairo and Alexandria, and (iii) for studies for the\n            replacement of the main fruit and vegetable wholesale\n            markets in those cities. Major benefits include reduction in\n            waste of agricultural products, employment creation, and\n            improved public health because animals would be slaughtered\n            under greatly improved conditions of hygiene. The major\n            risks are that the banks may not be able to commit and\n            disburse funds in a timely manner and the management of the\n            slaughterhouses may not be
