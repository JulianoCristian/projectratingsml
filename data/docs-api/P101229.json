PRSCs can make little\n            progress without a foundation of trust between the Bank and\n            the government, and among development partners at the\n            institutional and individual levels. The mechanisms for\n            dialogue also need to evolve so that the program can\n            continue to support and influence policy decisions at the\n            highest strategic level. To avoid misunderstanding, the Bank\n            and government can plan in advance to recalibrate the\n            program at a set point during implementation. The lack of\n            well-defined and realistic objectives and a fully developed\n            results framework makes adjustment to changing circumstances\n            difficult. Regular reporting on key outcome indicators is\n            essential so that data can drive adjustments to the PRSC\n            program. Transitioning to the use of PRSCs as the primary\n            instrument for resource transfer is only likely to be\n            successful in rare circumstances, when strong central\n            ministries can fully pursue a sector-inclusive dialogue\n            representing the perspectives of key players throughout\n            government. Elevating to the national dialogue\n            sector-specific structural reforms that stalled at the\n            sector level does not guarantee implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -

- Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Fourth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSC) Project for Tanzania were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: first, there is\n            no avoiding conditionality. Good practice principles of\n            policy-based lending are now routinely stated in almost\n            every operation and have become second nature in designing\n            policy-based operations. Donors should reinforce government\n            ownership by supporting rather than duplicating government\n            processes (aid harmonization among donors, alignment of aid\n            with the budget cycle, use of government procurement\n            processes, etc.). There should be an accountability\n            framework that guides both government and donors. Prior\n            Actions (as conditions of disbursement) should be few but\n            critical to the achievement of agreed results. Progress\n            reviews should be transparent and conducive to\n            performance-based, predictable budget support. Second,\n            unlike investment lending operations, PRSCs are able, in\n            principle, to deal with complex cross-cutting issues when\n            the Government has the requisite technical and coordination\n            capacities and the operations are supplemented by sector\n            Investment Loans (ILs), Technical Assistance (TA) and\n            competent analytical work. If the coordination and technical\n            capacities are limited, interventions in complex\n            cross-cutting areas have to be prioritized and sequenced.\n            Over time, as capacities get stronger, the number of complex\n            interventions can be increased. This is an area in which\n            wishful thinking often replaces hard-nosed realism, and\n            results in less than acceptable outcomes. Third, committed\n            political leadership makes a difference. Yet, even the best\n            leadership can only accomplish so much in a given time\n            period. It must overcome ever-present vested interests, old\n            mind-sets and ingrained behaviors, even assuming that\n            technical and organizational capacities are adequate. This\n            is a tricky area. There are often AAA products (as was the\n            case with a string of policy notes in Tanzania) that\n            identify aspects of these issues and there is anecdotal\n            evidence. But the job of transforming that knowledge into\n            successful interventions ultimately falls to the government.\n            The donors can at best figure out what actions are likely to\n            succeed and back them, or decide that the government is\n            unlikely to follow through and back off. It is extremely\n            difficult to get that balance right. Tanzania has been no\n            exception. Finally, measuring outcomes is important in order\n            to increase focus and accountability. Realistic, focused\n            monitoring frameworks that track progress over time towards\n            ultimate objectives, concentrate the mind of government as\n            well as the donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and\n            Eigth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Fourth Poverty\n

(PRSC-6) for Tanzania will be the third credit in a\n            series of five annual operations and the mid-cycle operation\n            supporting the implementation of Tanzania's National\n            Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (known as\n            MKUKUTA). Its strategic focus is on two key sets of\n            objectives: sustaining high and shared economic growth, and\n            expanding the effective delivery of basic services through\n            the government budget. There are two closely interrelated\n            and overlapping sets of risks for this operation. The first\n            set includes general risks that may interfere with the\n            successful implementation of the MKUKUTA, including the\n            vulnerability of Tanzania's economy to external shocks,\n            political risks related to the situation in Zanzibar, aid\n            dependence, decentralization, and capacity constraints. The\n            second set of risks could undermine the overall credibility\n            of the general budget support (GBS) process - and PRSC - as\n            an effective means to channel resources towards the\n            achievement of the MKUKUTA objectives. The operation\n            supports the significant progress that has been achieved by\n            government in improving the institutional and financial\n            set-up in the energy and transport sectors, and in the area\n            of governance, through the enactment of a new\n            anti-corruption and a new audit bill. The proposed credit,\n            together with other partners' budget support\n            contributions, sustains the government in funding its basic\n            services and infrastructure development needs, while\n            strengthening the country's own financial management\n            and budgetary delivery systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Sixth Poverty Reduction Support
