Both the Bank and the borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. The main lessons learned\n            from the project are: 1) When appraising a borrower for an\n            entrepreneurial business, especially in a new market such as\n            the one for ESCO services, the Bank should focus on the\n            capacity of the borrower to be flexible and entrepreneurial.\n            The Bank should consider if the right type of\n            entrepreneurial people will be available to spearhead this\n            new business model and if not, how such skills/attitudes can\n            be brought in to the project. 2) When lending to a borrower\n            that will enter an unfamiliar market, initial loan planning\n            should focus on listing risks and mitigation strategies, and\n            ensuring adequate liquidity to cover acceptable\n            contingencies. 3) The opening of ESCO markets requires\n            changes in the thinking of many stakeholders. The Bank\n            should plan to provide direct technical assistance to a\n            variety of entities beyond the borrower."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Krakow Energy Efficiency

decrease heat energy consumption by\n            improving energy efficiency at the end-user level, and,\n            develop knowledge-based mechanisms to finance energy\n            efficiency projects. The project components will: 1) support\n            strategic, and development investments, through the\n            connection of new DH, and domestic hot water (DHW) to\n            customers. By connecting pipeline branches to a booster pump\n            station, the transmission capacity will be increased,\n            allowing the purchase, and dispatch heat from the cheaper\n            source, thus reducing overall supply costs to customers, as\n            well as improving heat supply reliability to the southeast\n            region; 2) finance ecological investments, by sequentially\n            discontinuing current coal-fired heat-only-boilers (HOBs),\n            to instead connect customers to municipal heating systems. A\n            certain amount of HOBs will be converted to gas, or\n            oil-firing, co-financed by a grant from the Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF), and, plans to eliminate coal\n            stoves will be explored to protect the environment; 3)\n            modernize heat exchanger stations, through the installation\n            of plate heating exchangers in substations, and, by\n            replacing heating networks with pre-insulated pipe\n            technology; and, 4) finance heat efficiency investments, to\n            include institutional strengthening, by providing\n            computerization systems, and training to improve labor\n            productivity; replacing the automation of the Krakow system,\n            and a number of heat meters, as well as maintenance tools,\n            and equipment.
