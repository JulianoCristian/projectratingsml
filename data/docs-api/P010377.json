The\n            project achieved its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, GOP provinces should take the lead in the\n            preparation of provincial projects and designate staff to\n            ensure quality control and involve all stakeholders. Second,\n            a structured social mobilization program and\n            multi-disciplinary approach to project implementation is\n            essential for the success of irrigated agriculture projects.\n            Third, farmer training should be an integral part of project\n            design and initiated early in the project. Fourth,\n            consideration should be given to developing micro-credit to\n            help small farmers pay upfront contributions for CTWs and\n            watercourse improvements. Fifth, arrangements for internal\n            and external monitoring and impact evaluation activities\n            should be operationalized from the start of the project and\n            the quality of data collection and collation should be\n            closely supervised. Finally, continuity of competent and\n            motivated key project staff improves project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second SCARP Transition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second SCARP\n            Transition Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/731693/pakistan-second-scarp-transition-project","projn":"PK-Scarp Trans.
