The\n            project's complex nature, involving a large number of\n            subprojects, was of high risk, yet experimental, which\n            generated useful lessons. In the field of horticulture, it\n            is suggested that given the constraints in promoting an\n            horticultural organization for exporting purposes, given it\n            cannot be financially self sustaining in the short run, a\n            policy decision should be made - sustained with public funds\n            - but with a sound criteria that such funds are to sustain\n            only the initial stage, and, guidelines should be developed\n            for service user charges, for commercial purposes, and, to\n            balance between expertise in production, and marketing in\n            staff skills of such an organization. Regarding partnership\n            programs, initiatives need further simplification, through\n            community contracting procedures, to build in flexibility in\n            dealing with local issues, and, a sustainable financing\n            mechanism through leveraging funds from other sources, could\n            be explored to sustain successful activities. Finally,\n            concerning pilot subprojects, the increased awareness on the\n            benefits of soil testing should be explored, particularly\n            through private sector participation, in the provision of\n            cost-effective portable, soil testing facilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
