The unexpected lesson was that the productive\n            subprojects dealing with production/marketing chains,\n            irrigation, and resource conservation, which were on a\n            completely separate track from the other components, turned\n            out to have important catalytic effects for capacity\n            building. The very high demand for scarce grant financing\n            overshadowed the interest in capacity building. Nonetheless,\n            there was a catalytic effect on the incentives for\n            cooperation and collective action. Productive subprojects\n            energized the demand for capacity enhancement and in the\n            case of existing but stagnant organizations, provided them\n            with a renewed purpose. The significant lesson is that a\n            well-integrated amalgam of 'hard' and\n            'soft' resources is needed for effective capacity\n            building. The experience of PROLOCAL calls for a rethinking\n            of how best to provide ongoing technical and institutional\n            support for the organizations that have been launched by a\n            given project intervention toward more solid high performing\n            entities, but need continuous and affordable support. For\n            the future, this points to the creation of central service\n            centers, linked to existing second-level or umbrella\n            associations. Such centers could be financed initially by\n            the project but on a declining share, as the proportion of\n            national and local co-financing increases. In the case of\n            productive enterprise development, as the income of the\n            members grows, the capacity of payment for services\n            increases. The public subsidy portion can be justified as\n            'software' investments, necessary to ensure the\n            success of the supply of productive infrastructure and inputs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Poverty Reduction and Local Rural\n            Development (PROLOCAL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Poverty Reduction and\n

The\n            main components will: 1) promote social capital formation,\n            by supporting planning for local development, at the\n            community, parochial, and canton levels, as part of a\n            participatory development planning process. Rural\n            communities will identify priority subprojects, and,\n            community representatives will participate in the planning\n            process at the parochial level; likewise, cantons will\n            prepare their development plans, to include linkages to\n            parochial subprojects; 2) train local stakeholders through\n            organized nongovernmental organizations, who will survey\n            technical skills, and prepare a capacity gap analysis, and\n            implement training programs. Formation of local networks of\n            technicians will be promoted, to in turn expand their\n            technical skills, while technical assistance will build\n            local governments' management, and administrative\n            capacities; 3) establish a demand-driven grant fund, to\n            finance infrastructure, productive capacity of\n            socio-territorial organizations, and environmental\n            investment subprojects. Technical screening of this work\n            will be undertaken by technical personnel at the regional\n            level; and, 4) finance consulting services, and equipment to\n            implement
