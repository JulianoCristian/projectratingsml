Some lessons learned included: efforts to\n            restore native flora and fauna should take into account both\n            the level of public awareness and competing public values\n            concerning invasive alien species. Biodiversity values will\n            need to be balanced against other public use values such as\n            recreation, as in the case of the decision to remove the\n            pine trees from Table Mountain National Park. A decision to\n            eradicate one alien species in favor of another native one\n            such was the case concerning the removal of the Himalayan\n            tahr in favor of the Klipspringer should be vetted publicly\n            and options other than eradication should clearly be\n            considered. Public consultation and consensus building\n            campaigns can help to determine the optimal level of\n            eradication of local flora and fauna that will benefit the\n            biodiversity agenda and secure community support for local\n            conservation efforts. Projects that finance research,\n            whether basic or applied, should include a mechanism to\n            adapt research findings into ongoing implementation of\n            complementary project activities. A heavy investment was\n            made in invasive alien species clearing and rehabilitation,\n            both through a subcomponent of this project and through\n            several applied research grants funded by the Table Mountain\n            Fund (TMF). This research was published and disseminated,\n            but not systematically incorporated into the ongoing overall\n            program. A mechanism was also needed to channel information\n            arising from implementation to update the Table Mountain\n            Fund's grant proposal processes to align it with\n            program needs i.e. so that the Fund could effectively serve\n            as a think tank for on-the-ground project implementation.\n            Managing a small grant mechanism for biodiversity\n            conservation requires an investment in project development\n            to assure that the fund as a whole is geared toward\n            achieving its programmatic (and landscape) goals. Project\n            development necessarily involves thinking about\n            partnerships, often at the design stage, since the right\n            combination of actors will be needed to apply and adapt\n            research beyond the small pilot applications supported by a\n            fund such as the TMF. A range of partners should be brought\n            into the project development process, including local land\n            use decision makers in the government and/or conservation\n            agencies, community based organizations and non-governmental\n            organizations (NGOs) that can provide follow-on resources,\n            universities interested in furthering the research aim,\n            donors, and the private sector. Since applied research will\n            need to be adapted and scaled-up, getting buy-in from those\n            key constituents that are charged with land-use decisions\n            up-front can help to prioritize grant approval processes and\n            can contribute to enhanced sustainability of the outcomes of\n            successful interventions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Africa -

Some lessons suggest the following. This\n            Global Environment Facility (GEF) investment in South\n            Africa, in the immediate post-conflict period took advantage\n            of the \"window of opportunity\", offered by the\n            fluid policy and institutional environment, to catalyze a\n            paradigm shift in the way in which biodiversity conservation\n            is undertaken, establishing the conditions for more\n            effective conservation in the country. In addition, the\n            project benefited significantly from a broad-brush\n            Log-frame, which clearly set the objectives, and key\n            performance indicators, but avoided detail (10 percent\n            design and 90 percent implementation). This created\n            sufficient flexibility and robustness to allow adjustments\n            where necessary, and facilitated innovative approaches, and\n            solutions. A free hand was given to the architects of the\n            project to be innovative and to take risks. Learned from\n            this project, in a complex regional program, the roles of\n            various stakeholders should be differentiated (in\n            consultation with stakeholders) to determine a range of\n            levels, and forms of involvement appropriate to the needs of\n            the project and those of stakeholders. Key stakeholders\n            should be deeply involved in project governance from\n            inception. Highlighted is the alignment of objectives, work\n            programs and budgets of partner agencies, with the goals of\n            the CAPE Strategy, which leveraged huge benefits for\n            implementation. Nevertheless, the executing agencies\n            indicated that their work could have been better facilitated\n            if they had a deeper knowledge of GEF financial, and\n            procurement procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Africa - Cape Peninsula Biodiversity\n            Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"South Africa - Cape Peninsula\n            Biodiversity Conservation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/02/6584695/south-africa-cape-peninsula-biodiversity-conservation-project","projn":"ZA-Gef Cape Penninsula Sil (Fy98) -- P035923","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Tourism and Ecotourism,Wildlife Resources,Environmental Economics & Policies,Ecosystems and Natural Habitats","teratopic":"Environment","count":"South Africa","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20060208100427"},"subsc":"Forestry,Other social services,Other industry,General public administration sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plan, Active participation, coastal\n            waters, alien invasive species, alien species, animal,\n            animal populations, audits, baseline data, benefit analysis,\n            bio-control, BIODIVERSITY, Biodiversity Assessment,\n            BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION\n            PROJECT, biodiversity priorities, biodiversity project,\n            biological diversity, biological resources, bioregional\n            planning, breeding, brush, burning, Coastal Management,\n            coastal waters, coastal zone, coastal zone management,\n            conservation activities, conservation agency, conservation\n            community, conservation initiatives, Conservation\n            International, conservation management, conservation\n            measures, conservation of biodiversity, Conservation\n            Planning, conservation policy, conservation priorities,\n            conservation priority, conservation status, conservation\n            strategies, conservation work, Critical Ecosystem,\n            ecological landscape, ecological processes, ecological\n            sustainability, ecosystem approach, effective conservation,\n            endangered plant species, Environmental, environmental\n            awareness, Environmental education, Environmental\n            Information, Environmental Management, environmental\n            resources, erosion control, evolution, Exchange Rate,\n            extinction, Fauna, Fauna International, fence, financial\n            resources, fire management, Fire Risk, fish fauna, fishing,\n            Flora International, Floristic Region, Forest, Forest Fire,\n            Forestry, forestry sector, freshwater habitats, geographic\n            extent, global warming, Grasslands, habitat, habitat\n            diversity, habitats, hotel, income, injection, invasive\n            alien species, invasive plants, issues, Key indicators, land\n            degradation, land use, land use planning, legislation,\n            Living Resources, management systems, marine animals, marine\n            biodiversity, marine ecosystems, marine environment, marine\n            fish, Marine Living Resources, marine park, marine research,\n            marine systems, monitoring programs, National Biodiversity,\n            National Biodiversity Institute, National Biodiversity\n            Strategy, National Park, National Parks, natural areas,\n            Nature, Nature Conservation, net present value, park\n            boundaries, Park boundary, park management, plant, plant\n            species, policy environment, poverty alleviation, private\n            land, private property, protected areas, protection,\n            provincial conservation, roads, seed funding, severe\n            erosion, severe threat, species, species of fish, species\n            richness, sustainable development, sustainable management,\n            synergy, terrestrial biodiversity, tourism infrastructure,\n            tree species, unique biodiversity, variety, vegetation,\n            Wetlands, Wildlife"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF024525-USAID-NATIONAL ENVIRON.
