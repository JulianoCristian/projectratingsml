An important benefit of the project was\n            increased and more open policy dialogue with government on a\n            range of economic management issues, including public debt\n            and new borrowing, expenditure allocations and priorities,\n            and economic reform priorities. Adequate investment in\n            policy dialogue is vital but resource intensive. Success of\n            the program relied on development of close working\n            relationships with both government and other donors\n            providing budget support. Project-level engagement can\n            assist in identifying key priorities to be supported through\n            policy-based operations. Close coordination and engagement\n            with other development partners in the identification of\n            policy priorities is useful in sectors where the Bank has\n            limited knowledge and engagement. Coordinated management of\n            international aid flows, in the context of prudent fiscal\n            policy, can provide vital support in mitigating the impacts\n            of external shocks in the Pacific Islands."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tonga - First and Second Economic Recovery\n            Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga - First and Second Economic\n

the Government of Tonga (GoT) to implement key\n            aspects of its medium-term reform agenda, while providing a\n            predictable flow of resources in a challenging fiscal\n            environment. Tonga's economy is beginning to recover\n            from the series of crises that have buffeted it in recent\n            years, but the incipient recovery is dependent on external\n            support. Tonga is a small, remote economy that is highly\n            vulnerable to external shocks and dependent on a limited\n            number of sources of foreign exchange. In recent years,\n            Tonga has undertaken a number of important public sector and\n            economic reforms, but robust economic growth has remained\n            elusive. Over the last four years, the series of crises that\n            have buffeted the Tongan economy have caused economic\n            contraction, a significant fiscal gap, and rising poverty.\n            The multi-year programmatic series of operations will assist\n            the GoT to appropriately sequence key public sector and\n            economic reforms over a medium-term time horizon, while\n            supporting the GoT's capacity to deliver services in a\n            challenging fiscal environment. The operation carries a high\n            risk on account of the limited institutional capacity of the\n            GoT, the recent nature of Tonga's political reforms,\n            and Tonga's
