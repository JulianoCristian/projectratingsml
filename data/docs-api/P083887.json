Ratings for the Second Development Support\n            Credit Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Fourth Development Support Credit Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Bank must\n            maintain a close dialogue with political parties out of\n            power and with other key opinion makers to have a better\n            assessment of the support for reforms. This approach is\n            strategic and must be done even while working closely with\n            and supporting like minded governments. Such an approach\n            helps to mitigate risks of possible reversals if and when\n            the ruling parties change, and to avoid the appearance of\n            playing favorites. The Bank needs to do much more targeted\n            and tailored engagement and communication with stakeholders,\n            quite apart from the Government. This is needed for\n            deepening ownership and support for reforms under\n            programmatic loans, such as the DSC. Such an approach\n            becomes all the more critical during the tenure of an\n            elected government which tends to be disproportionately\n            sensitive to public opinion and is, oftentimes, reluctant to\n            make unpopular policy choices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Development Support Credit\n            Series (I-IV)

This Simplified Implementation\n            Completion Report (SICR) provides the following findings and\n            implications for subsequent operation(s). The project sought\n            to continue supporting Government's efforts to\n            stabilize the macroeconomic environment, improve the\n            investment climate, and strengthen economic institutions.\n            While progress continued in each of these areas, on the\n            institutional front, notable achievements included the\n            establishment of the Energy Regulatory Commission, and the\n            Anti-Corruption Commission, with some progress in\n            strengthening tax administration and banking sector\n            regulation by the Bangladesh Bank. However, these can only\n            be viewed as incremental steps in what is necessarily a\n            long-term and complex process of institutional building.\n            Future operations need to be realistic in setting goals in\n            this area; since local capacity is very weak, therefore, the\n            Bank and the donor community will need to stay engaged,\n            providing support over a long period. Project experience\n            confirms that strong country ownership is essential for the\n            success of reforms, best when the designs of these are\n            homegrown. The reform process in the banking sector, for\n            example, progressed slower than initially anticipated, due\n            to inadequate attention given to the political economy,\n            considerations which led to setting some over-ambitious\n            goals. The political difficulty of implementing energy price\n            increases was seemingly, also underestimated in designing\n            the reforms. Also important, are future adjustment\n            operations, which should be more closely aligned to the\n            budget.

The macroeconomic framework is on track,\n            banking and state own enterprise (SOE) reforms have\n            proceeded with some minor variations and broad governance\n            reforms have moved ahead. In the energy sector several\n            structural reforms have moved ahead, although progress on\n            the privatization front has been inadequate. The other area\n            where there has been significant shortfall is regarding\n            implementation of energy price agreements under DSC I. This\n            is largely due to unanticipated surge in world oil prices\n            and the Government considers a full pass through of these\n            increases to consumers as politically impossible. It has\n            nevertheless made some minimum adjustments in gas, kerosene\n            and petrol prices and has also reduced the taxes on\n            petroleum products. While all energy product prices\n            excluding domestic taxes exceed international prices,\n            including tax (weighted average rate of about 30%) the\n            domestic prices fall short for kerosene and diesel. Since\n            these products account for some 75% of total oil\n            consumption, the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation is\n            incurring losses. The resultant adverse impact o f higher\n            petroleum costs on BPC's finances has been offset by\n            the lower central Government deficit. Importantly, the\n            Government has taken new measures relating to tax revenues\n            and trade tariff reductions in the FY05 budget that\n            strengthen the overall reform program and demonstrate the\n            Government's resolve to stay the course on reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Development Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Development\n            Support Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4839373/bangladesh-second-development-support-credit-project","projn":"BD-Development Support Credit II -- P083887","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,National Governance","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040707104920"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other domestic and international trade,General finance sector,General energy sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade,Finance,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability,Administrative\n            Reforms,Anti-Corruption,anti-corruption\n            strategy,audits,authorization,banking sector,budget\n            deficit,budgetary funds,budgetary resources,business\n            sector,Central Government,civil society,commercial\n            banks,complex task,corporate sector,Currency\n            Unit,development partners,Development Policy,domestic\n            demand,donor community,Economic activity,economic\n            growth,employment,Environmental Issues,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditure,expenditure management,external\n            debt,Financial management,financial sector,fiscal,fiscal\n            policy,foreign exchange,good governance,governance\n            challenge,governance challenges,governance\n            problems,government effectiveness,government\n            institutions,Health Services,human\n            development,imports,increased\n            transparency,inequality,inflation,inflationary\n            pressures,institutional reforms,interest rates,INTERNATIONAL\n            DEVELOPMENT,investment climate,iron,judiciary,lending\n            rates,Local Government,macroeconomic framework,macroeconomic\n            management,macroeconomic performance,macroeconomic\n            stability,national level,National Poverty,oil,Parliament,per\n            capita income,performance indicators,performance\n            standards,police force,political interference,poverty\n            line,Poverty Reduction,Poverty Reduction Strategy,priority\n            areas,private sector,private sector development,private\n            sector investment,public administration,public\n            contracts,public procurement,Public Sector,Public Sector\n            Management,public service,public service delivery,public\n            spending,quotas,retirement,Revenue collection,senior civil\n            service,Social Development,social indicators,social\n            outcomes,social programs,social protection,social\n            sector,social sectors,social services,State\n            Enterprises,state-owned enterprises,structural\n            reform,structural reforms,Task Team Leader,tax\n            administration,tax evasion,tax Revenues,Trade\n            Liberalization,transparency,vested interests,workers"}},"owner":"Econ.
