To achieve\n            these objectives, the credit will finance high priority\n            sub-projects. These sub-projects will concentrate on\n            improving the capacity of certain government ministries to\n            manage the Ugandan economy; strengthening the planning and\n            project preparation capacities of sector ministries; and\n            enhancing the Institute of Public Administration's\n            ability to provide training in Uganda.
