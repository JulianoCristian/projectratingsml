The Pilot Private Irrigation Project (PPIP)\n            had a highly satisfactory outcome; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; and both Bank and Borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. The Natural Resources\n            Management Project (NRMP) had a satisfactory outcome, risk\n            to the development outcome was moderate; and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.

Export development needs to follow a well defined\n            strategy, and a commodity chain approach needs to emphasize\n            producer-exporter linkages.

The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            adjudged as satisfactory. A number of factors relating to\n            community empowerment in rural areas influenced the\n            probability of the project's success: intensive\n            sensitization/awareness-raising and flexibility in forming\n            organizations; the overall approach to project\n            implementation, which augmented social capital accumulation\n            and reinforced community ownership as well as the\n            introduction of community-based procurement procedures,\n            which significantly improved motivation and allowed for new\n            capacities and competencies to be developed within the\n            communities; community co-financing and \"sweat\n            labor\" the quick and transparent process of approving\n            or rejecting community submissions for project development\n            funds. The initial introduction of CBPP after the Mid-Term\n            Review met with some resistance and procrastination on the\n            part of some government officials and community leaders.\n            Although these obstacles were overcome through vigorous\n            intervention by the Ministerial authorities, they should not\n            be underestimated. Entrenched constituencies may jeopardize\n            such initiatives and full Government support is an absolute\n            requisite for such a project to succeed. Other lessons\n            learned regarded the flexible approach to project\n            eligibility criteria that was well matched to the diversity\n            of community demands. Lastly, the project demonstrated that:\n            1) community ownership of NRM development plans and projects\n            depends on building a sound knowledge among community\n            members of land and resources through simple diagnostic\n            analyses; 2) a combination of capacity building and the\n            implementation of a wide range of development activities is\n            important to ensure the sustainability of NRM activities; 3)\n            the distribution of donkey carts as positive incentives to\n            youth workers demonstrated the need to directly and\n            specificly target women and youth in micro-development\n            activities in order to enhance probability of success and\n            sustainability; and 4) decentralized NRM activities need to\n            be complemented by policy reforms (in particular on land\n            tenure) and institutional development components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Natural Resources Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Natural Resources\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/03/2280433/niger-natural-resources-management-project","projn":"NE-Natural Res.
