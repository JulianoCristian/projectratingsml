Thus, the\n            Evaluation Summary rating of satisfactory for outcome of\n            both projects is confirmed, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and the Borrower is rated satisfactory rather than\n            highly satisfactory. The rating of sustainability as likely\n            for both projects is also confirmed, and that for\n            institutional development impact is raised from substantial\n            to high. The experience of coal sector restructuring in\n            Russia points to a few important lessons of general\n            applicability in the case of complex and politically\n            contentious reform programs with a high social impact:\n            government commitment and political will are indispensable.\n            External financing in support of coal restructuring in\n            Russia provided a powerful incentive to stay the course, but\n            the decisive factor in securing success was the fundamental\n            commitment of the Government. Effective stakeholder\n            participation can greatly enhance robustness of the\n            achievements and lessen the implementation and information\n            burdens of the Government and the Bank. A strengthened\n            safety net helps greatly in gaining acceptance of enterprise\n            closures among workers and their communities, even in\n            difficult and polarized situations. Adequate attention and\n            funding should be devoted up front to the environmental\n            aspects of enterprise closures (especially in the case of\n            mines) to minimize the problem of large residual liabilities\n            that may hold up the liquidation of enterprises that have\n            already ceased operations. Finally, implementation schedules\n            should be realistic and flexible, while disbursements should\n            be tailored to concrete progress in agreed reforms. The Coal\n            SECAL II was under implementation for four years instead of\n            the originally planned two years, with most of the progress\n            recorded in the last two years. Moreover, the 1999\n            restructuring of the loan's original floating tranches\n            into smaller, more manageable tranches was instrumental in\n            facilitating implementation of the agreed restructuring actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Coal Sector Adjustment\n            Loan, and Second Coal Sector Adjustment Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Coal Sector\n            Adjustment Loan, and Second Coal Sector Adjustment Loan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2385619/russian-federation-coal-sector-adjustment-loan-second-coal-sector-adjustment-loan","projn":"RU-Coal Sector Adjustment Loan -- P038550,RU-Coal Secal 2 -- P050486","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Fuels,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20030618144756"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Mining and other extractive,General energy sector,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"audits,closure,Closures,Coal,coal\n            industry,coal mine,Coal miners,Coal Sector,Coal Sector\n            Restructuring,coal\n            subsidies,conditionality,electricity,Employment,entitlements,expenditures,Forestry,Fuel,labor\n            force,mine closure,mines,Mining,mining areas,mining\n            communities,mining companies,mining company,mining\n            history,natural resources,oil,Operational\n            Policies,Privatization,Productivity,sand,self-evaluation,Sustainability,sustainable\n            use,Transparency and Accountability,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"audits,closure,Closures,Coal,coal\n            industry,coal mine,Coal miners,Coal Sector,Coal Sector\n            Restructuring,coal\n            subsidies,conditionality,electricity,Employment,entitlements,expenditures,Forestry,Fuel,labor\n            force,mine closure,mines,Mining,mining areas,mining\n            communities,mining companies,mining company,mining\n            history,natural resources,oil,Operational\n            Policies,Privatization,Productivity,sand,self-evaluation,Sustainability,sustainable\n            use,Transparency and Accountability,wages"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF023875-USAID-ENERGY/ENVIRONMENT STUDY\n            IN NIS,TF029326-PHRD -COAL SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN,TF034532-RUSSIA - SECTOR RESTRUCTURING\n            IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE PROJ.","repnb":"26067"},"11305662":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/01/11305662/russian-federation-coal-sector-adjustment-loans","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/01/11305662/russian-federation-coal-sector-adjustment-loans","new_url":"2003/01/11305662/russian-federation-coal-sector-adjustment-loans","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/11/04/000334955_20091104045954/Rendered/INDEX/514370WP0RU0Co10Box342028B01PUBLIC1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/11/04/000334955_20091104045954/Rendered/PDF/514370WP0RU0Co10Box342028B01PUBLIC1.pdf","loan_no":"4058;4262","docdt":"2003-01-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2009-11-04T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Coal sector adjustment loans"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Russian coal sector was in need of\n            reforms after beginning its transition from a planned\n            economy in 1991. In 1996 and 2000, the World Bank provided\n            two sector adjustment loans, or SECALs, for socially\n            sustainable restructuring of the Russian coal sector. During\n            this restructuring, some major reforms took place, including\n            a change in institutional roles that ensured an improvement\n            in accountability mechanisms in the coal sector, which\n            ensured better social protection for all workers. The\n            workers, including disabled miners, became aware of their\n            entitlements and could voice their opinions through their\n            local groups, which did not exist earlier. Wage payments\n            were made on time, and the workers started to receive the\n            entirety of their monthly salaries in cash. Safety\n            conditions for workers also improved. Inefficient mines\n            ceased to operate, and restructuring was aimed at ensuring\n            employment for the laid-off workers in other sectors.\n            However, this approach could not fully address the aftermath\n            of layoffs and terminations in the coal industry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation -

The project consists of five components.  1)\n            Commercialization and demonopolization of the coal sector\n            will bring about competition among coal companies.  2)\n

of\n            loans, provided on a competitive basis.  3) Mine closures\n            and workforce reductions will be conducted at minimal cost\n            and social protection benefits will be provided to all\n            eligible persons.  4) Subsidies will be paid to finance\n            physical mine closures, scientific research activities,\n            severance payments and wage arrears, disability payments,\n            and a contingency Social Protection Reserve Fund.  5) Public\n            participation and social impact monitoring will inform the\n            public
