Some\n            lessons learned included: the NRM-DPL operation is one of\n            the few DPLs where Sectoral Investment Lending (SIL) related\n            elements were maintained. While in the context of this\n            operation, it turned out to be a relevant solution, as\n            indicated by the Borrower-, it has generated important\n            delays and confusions. It is thus not recommended to\n            replicate such 'hybrid' instrument in other\n            operations. Governmental reform programs are broad by\n            definition. The design phase of a development policy\n            operation aims at targeting a set of reforms within the\n            overall reform program of the Government in a given sector.\n            It is very important that both parties share the same\n            understanding of the reforms to be implemented under the\n            policy lending as well as the associated prior actions and\n            triggers: indicators need to be well-specified, agreed\n            up-front with the Borrower, and closely monitored by both\n            the Borrower and the Bank during implementation (the policy\n            matrix proved to be a useful tool). Any change during\n            implementation needs to be jointly discussed and agreed\n            upon. When other critical issues emerge during the course of\n            the operation, those should not be included as new prior\n            actions or triggers (as was the case for the Forest Fund in\n            the NRM-DPL operation) but should rather be part of the\n            broader policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gabonese -

While the report does not yet\n            determine whether the project must restore villages, along\n            with providing land as compensation. To minimize impacts and\n            reduce costs, it may be possible to reform the laws to allow\n            human activities in the national parks unless villages\n            prefer establishing new sites outside the park. PAPs whose\n            livelihoods are entirely based on the park will also be\n            provided new income opportunities that are non-land-based\n            and guarantee the incomes they had in the pre-park\n            situation.

This report discusses strategies for achieving\n            this aim. The indigenous people of Gabon are identified as\n            the Babongo, Bakoya, Baka, Barimba, Bagama, Bakouyi, and\n            Akoa - the pygmies. The risks resulting from this project\n            which threaten to impact thee people include: loss of\n            control over traditional land, becoming even more\n            marginalized in society; disintegration of the decentralized\n            system of administration, less assistance received from\n            government services, fewer capacities to defend their legal\n            rights, dependency on other ethnic groups, loss of cultural\n            and social identity. To offset these potential risks, the\n            plan will establish equal legal opportunities, technical\n            opportunities, financial opportunities, organizational\n            opportunities, and cultural opportunities. Among the\n            activities planned are putting in place capacity and\n            structure, providing ID cards, recognizing the settlements\n            as villages equal to other settlements, establishing\n            community forests, recognizing and protecting the land use\n            areas of indigenous people, announcing a national policy on\n            illegal immigrants, enabling the indigenous to actively\n            participate in natural resource management, improving\n            intercultural communication, improving research to provide\n            baseline information, ensuring indigenous people receive a\n            fair share of the redistribution of forest revenue,\n            facilitating forest-related decision-making,   and\n            establishing a participatory monitoring and evaluation system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Programme Sectoriel Forets et Environnement\n            (PSFE) -
