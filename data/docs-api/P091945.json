Some lessons learned included: the\n            project design had emphasized the need for further reforms\n            in the power sector, but proposed that the reforms and the\n            pace of reform were government owned. In addition, the\n            placement of conditions or rigid covenants was considered\n            inappropriate. With the benefit of hind sight, such\n            strategic project design indeed had helped restore\n            confidence between the government and the Bank, and\n            facilitated other policy dialogue. The experience of this\n            Project has shown that it would not be practical to halt\n            power project implementation when difficult power sector\n            reforms were placed on hold. There were clear benefits of\n            having parallel tracks for project implementation and close\n            dialogue on resuming sector reforms. This approach has led\n            to successful project implementation and meaningful\n            consultation with the authorities on sector reforms.<BR><BR>"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt, Arab

Construction and\n            commissioning of El-Tebbin power plant has been completed.\n            The plant, which consists of two identical units of 350 MW,\n            has been put into commercial operation and has passed the\n            reliability test. Performance tests for both units were\n            successfully concluded in December 2010. Of the total\n            US$259.60 million amount of loan, US$220.22 million has been\n            disbursed to date. A delay by the contractor responsible for\n            the mechanical equipment and pipe installation and the delay\n            in preparing the final list of required spare parts caused a\n            delay in the delivery of spare parts under a related\n            contract for supply and installation of the steam turbine\n            generator, financed by the World Bank loan. In addition\n            further delays in supply and installation of steam generator\n            and auxiliaries including start up and commissioning\n            resulted in disbursement during January, February 2011 as a\n            result of Egypt's political crisis. Because of the\n            delay, an amount of Euro14.8 million (equivalent to about\n            US$ 20.1 million or 7.8 percent of the loan) is expected to\n            be withdrawn after the original closing date of April 30,\n            2011 to cover spare parts that are to be delivered also\n            after the original closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - El-Tebbin Power
