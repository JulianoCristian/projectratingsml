While the performance of the\n            Borrower is satisfactory, largely due to substantial\n            achievement of project objectives, the performance of the\n            Bank is unsatisfactory, based on poor quality of project\n            supervision. Among the lessons learned, the experience of\n            this operation conveys that long-term solvency of financial\n            institutions, in a deregulated environment, requires\n            prudential regulations, effective supervision, and\n            transparency in accounting and information systems, for\n            better management accountability. Thus, difficult decisions\n            should be taken by the governments, particularly, during a\n            financial crisis, to prevent further exacerbation. The Bank\n            should then, not only, pursue a commitment to deregulate\n            financial systems, but agree on a detailed action plan, and\n            its prerequisites for rapid deregulation, to improve, and\n            facilitate effective monitoring of project implementation.\n            Since weak financial institutions are often driven by strong\n            government directions, which influence banks' lending\n            decisions, it is implied that the financial position, and\n            performance of institutions may not be as reported. This led\n            to a build-up of institutional development programs, but\n            mixed results show that these are at best, limited to impact\n            the corporate, and banking practices. Emphasis is placed on\n            the adequacy of staff, and budget allocation for essential supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Financial Intermediation
