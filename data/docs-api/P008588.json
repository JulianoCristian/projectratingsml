The ETP represents a\n            program combining stabilization and structural change,\n            including a radical liberalization of the trade regime as\n            well as pricing. The ETP also includes a medium-term\n            macroeconomic framework and external financing strategy. The\n            microeconomic core program comprises three main components:\n            (a) enterprise restructuring, privatization, private sector\n            development, with appropriate legislation to impose\n            financial discipline and establish an adequate institutional\n            framework for enterprise restructuring, including stricter\n            environmental standards; (b) financial sector reform, with\n            emphasis on improved banking regulation and supervision,\n            introduction of adequate accounting and auditing standards,\n            and strengthening and phase re-structuring of the banking\n            system; and (c) social safety net, with emphasis on adequate\n            unemployment benefits, employment services, training, a\n            program of minimum social assistance, and improvement of\n            health policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Structural Adjustment\n            Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/07/737209/poland-structural-adjustment-loan-project","projn":"PL-Sal I-114858 -- P008588","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Poland","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960929093147"},"subsc":"(Historic)Economic management","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,amounts\n            owed,assets,auditing,Bank lending,bankruptcy,budget\n            deficits,budget surplus,capital flows,central bank,coal,coal\n            prices,commercial banks,competitiveness,corporate income\n            tax,CPI,creditworthiness,current expenditures,debt,debt\n            relief,devaluation,dividends,Economic activity,Economic\n            Assistance,Economic Performance,economic\n            situation,electricity,employment,energy\n            consumption,Equalization,excess demand,exchange\n            rate,exchange rates,expenditures,export\n            growth,exports,financial Institutions,financial\n            intermediaries,financial restructuring,Financial\n            Sector,fiscal management,Fiscal Policy,foreign\n            competition,foreign exchange,free\n            elections,fuels,GDP,government subsidies,housing,housing\n            subsidies,imports,income,inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,labor\n            force,labor productIvIty,legislation,liquidation,living\n            conditions,London Club,low interest rates,"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,amounts\n            owed,assets,auditing,Bank lending,bankruptcy,budget\n            deficits,budget surplus,capital flows,central bank,coal,coal\n            prices,commercial banks,competitiveness,corporate income\n            tax,CPI,creditworthiness,current expenditures,debt,debt\n            relief,devaluation,dividends,Economic activity,Economic\n            Assistance,Economic Performance,economic\n            situation,electricity,employment,energy\n            consumption,Equalization,excess demand,exchange\n            rate,exchange rates,expenditures,export\n            growth,exports,financial Institutions,financial\n            intermediaries,financial restructuring,Financial\n            Sector,fiscal management,Fiscal Policy,foreign\n            competition,foreign exchange,free\n            elections,fuels,GDP,government subsidies,housing,housing\n            subsidies,imports,income,inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,labor\n            force,labor productIvIty,legislation,liquidation,living\n            conditions,London Club,low interest rates,"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"P5294"},"facets":{}}}
