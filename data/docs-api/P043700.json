The performances of the Borrower and the Bank are\n            rated satisfactory. Among the lessons learned were these: 1)\n            The implementation pace of reforms and related risks should\n            be properly assessed on the basis of past experience. 2) Too\n            many dated covenants are not effective. 3) A strong business\n            base for services and market trends is important in reaching\n            financial sustainability objectives for revenue generating\n            entities 4) Achieving privatization objectives depends upon\n            the convergence of a supportive environment and strong and\n            continuing Government commitment. 5) As regards staff\n            reduction, unconditional volunteering may deplete the most\n            skilled resources. Instead, setting criteria for the\n            eligibility to redundancy package should be considered. 6)\n            It is possible to achieve substantial reforms and\n            institutional development under investment lending operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -
