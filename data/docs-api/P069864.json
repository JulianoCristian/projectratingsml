Ratings for the Second Public Sector\n            Management Adjustment Loan Project for Macedonia are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Public Finance Management\n            Project for Slovak Republic are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned include:\n            although differences dominated similarities in the three\n            projects, the one common factor that had a determining\n            influence on outcomes was the extent of government\n            commitment to the projects. Sound analytical work was\n            necessary but not sufficient for project success. All three\n            projects were based on sound analytical work and they\n            matched government strategy. In the case of the Public\n            Finance Management Project (PFMP) there was a hand-in-glove\n            match between analytical work and government strategy, as\n            the government adopted the full recommendations of the\n            Development Policy Review. Concentrating on core elements\n            was a factor contributing to success. Compared with the\n            PFMP, the other two projects over-reached in their ambitions\n            to achieve rather wide development policy goals. In the\n            main, introducing elements that were outside the purview of\n            the budget, such as health and pension reform, affected the\n            efficacy of these two operations and prevented them from\n            fully realizing their goals. Finally, when the different\n            elements of a project fit together well, the project has a\n            greater probability of success. The different elements of\n            the PFMP fit each other better with one another than those\n            of either the Public Sector Management Credit (PSMAC) or the\n            PSMAL and were not as widely dispersed as the two Former\n            Yugoslav Republic (FYR) Macedonia operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Public Sector Management\n            Adjustment Loan Project,

to strengthen Slovakia's institutional capacity\n            in the use of public resources effectively, and\n            transparently. The first component will improve the budget\n            process, by helping the Government with the allocation, and\n            operation of public expenditures, by linking policy\n            decisions to budgeting, making strategic policy choices\n            through program prioritization within available resources;\n            increasing funding, in order to plan ahead sustainable\n            programs; supporting an increased autonomy, and incentives\n            for effective use of funds; generating a budget process in\n            which the regular evaluation of outcomes feeds into future\n            budgetary choices; fostering capacity building within the\n            Ministry of Finance (MOF) for expenditure reviews; and,\n            developing policy analysis for alternative financing, to\n            support a decentralized system of public service delivery.\n            The second component, strengthening macroeconomic capacity\n            in the MOF, would help establish a core of macro-analyses in\n            the MOF, and the Government, through technical and\n            organizational improvements, including developing\n            institutional links within the MOF, and the State Treasury;\n            assigning a central role to macroeconomic forecasts as the\n            basis for establishing resources for the budget process;\n            and, improving the quality of medium term macroeconomic, and\n            fiscal forecasts, by improving the technical quality of the\n            models used. The third component, support for debt\n            management and treasury, would assist the Government in the\n            development of an institutional structure in which\n            accountability is clearly defined, distinguishing between\n            debt formulation and management strategy; ensure a\n            transparent management of public debt, and financial assets,\n            appropriately balancing risks and costs. Moreover, the\n            development of a domestic debt market and legal framework\n            will be pursued, identifying implicit and explicit\n            contingent liabilities, establishing a monitoring system\n            that provide a quality assessment of public accounting,\n            facilitating a new treasury system. Finally, the fourth\n            component will support program coordination, and project\n            management, finance technical assistance, and design\n            appropriate institutional
