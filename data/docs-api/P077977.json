Some lessons learned\n            included: there was wide variation in the capacity of states\n            to implement the program effectively. The design for similar\n            projects should build in some flexibility in the level of\n            support required by different states in order to tailor the\n            technical assistance program to the needs of each state. To\n            support the development of capacity at state level, there is\n            a need to institutionalize training activities within\n            existing national and state institutions like state\n            technical agencies and other academic institutions engaged\n            in PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana).  Another\n            important lesson relates to ensuring that maintenance of the\n            road network is done in a regular and sustainable way, which\n            in turn requires that reform in maintenance be carried out\n            in an incremental and steady manner. The project though well\n            designed for community participation for the 'project\n            planning' cycle through tools such as information\n            dissemination; transect walk; collaboration for\n            participatory mapping of the impacts; etc. had limited\n            design for 'community participation and\n            supervision' during the stage of construction. To\n            achieve comprehensive community participation, social\n            accountability systems through models such as Community\n            Score Cards, Social Audit, etc. may be implemented.\n            Extension of Rural Development Program to the adversely\n            affected. There are currently no provisions in other rural\n            development programs for preferential treatment of people\n            affected by PMGSY. It is therefore important to identify\n            certain rural development income generation/beneficiary\n            development schemes for the benefit of vulnerable PAPs\n            affected by building rural roads under the PMGSY, and amend\n            those identified schemes to build in the criteria and\n            provisions for inclusion of adversely affected project\n            affected persons (PAPs) of PMGSY belonging to vulnerable sections."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Rural Roads Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Rural Roads

The project is being implemented in\n            four states i.e. Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and\n            Uttar Pradesh. Jharkhand has not performed well under the\n            project although planned works on 150 km of roads in that\n            state are nearly completed. Under a previous restructuring,\n            funds that were originally allocated for use in Jharkhand\n            were reallocated to Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The\n            extension will help the National Rural Roads Development\n            Agency (NRRDA) and the participating states to: (a) further\n            consolidate the institutional development initiatives,\n            including innovative methods to plan and execute maintenance\n            works; (b) complete the ongoing and additional rural roads\n            works to be taken up from the recently reallocated funds to\n            Uttar Pradesh ($ 27 m) and Rajasthan ($ 9 m). These works\n            are scheduled for completion by December 2011. In addition,\n            some ongoing works in Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh\n            will not be complete until December 31, 2010; and, (c)\n            undertake further capacity building activities planned for\n            rural roads agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Rural Roads Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Rural Roads Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/03/12068833/india-rural-roads-project-restructuring","projn":"IN-Rural Roads Project -- P077977","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Regional Rural Development,Roads & Highways,E-Business,Rural Roads & Transport","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Transport,Rural Development","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100409005131"},"theme":"Rural services and infrastructure","subsc":"Roads and highways,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Transport,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to markets, action plan, budget\n            allocations, capacity building, connectivity, control\n            system, development activities, equipment, Financial\n            management, financing plan, Framework, ID, implementation of\n            road works, implementing agencies, Implementing Agency,\n            management system, management systems, networks, periodic\n            maintenance, poverty impact, Procurement, Public Works,\n            RECONSTRUCTION, result, Results, road works, routine\n            maintenance, Rural, Rural Development, rural population,\n            Rural Road, Rural Roads, social services, supervision,\n            Targets, technical assistance, traffic, training workshops, user"}},"owner":"Transport (SASDT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"53920"},"8019130":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2007/08/8019130/india-rural-roads-project-procurement-plan-2007-2008-phase-vii-upgrade-jaipur","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2007/08/8019130/india-rural-roads-project-procurement-plan-2007-2008-phase-vii-upgrade-jaipur","new_url":"2007/08/8019130/india-rural-roads-project-procurement-plan-2007-2008-phase-vii-upgrade-jaipur","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/08/02/000310607_20070802110939/Rendered/INDEX/Procurement0Plan010Jaipur010Works40494.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2007/08/02/000310607_20070802110939/Rendered/PDF/Procurement0Plan010Jaipur010Works40494.pdf","loan_no":"4753","credit_no":"3987","datestored":"2007-08-02T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2007-08-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - Rural Roads Project : procurement\n            plan 2007-2008 phase VII upgrade (Jaipur)"},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Rural Roads Project : procurement\n            plan 2007-2008 phase VII upgrade (Jaipur)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Rural Roads Project :\n            procurement plan 2007-2008 phase VII upgrade (Jaipur)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/08/8019130/india-rural-roads-project-procurement-plan-2007-2008-phase-vii-upgrade-jaipur","projn":"IN-Rural Roads Project -- P077977","docty":"Procurement Plan","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000310607_20070802110939"},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Roads and highways,Sub-national government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":",,"}},"owner":"Office of the Regional Vice Pres (SARVP),Transport (SASDT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"40494"},"facets":{}}}
