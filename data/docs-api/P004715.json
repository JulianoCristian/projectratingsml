The project will directly benefit some 6,800 farm\n            families, about 40 percent of whom at present have incomes\n            below the absolute poverty level. A further 2,000 landless\n            agricultural households living in the project area will also\n            benefit because of the additional labor demand generated by\n            the project. The project entails no unusual risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Twelfth Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Twelfth Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/06/726110/thailand-twelfth-irrigation-project","projn":"TH-Irr Xii(Mae Klong) -- P004715","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Water Resources Law,Water Law,Agricultural Research,Crops and Crop Management Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912524921"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,agricultural labor,AGRICULTURAL\n            PRODUCTION,agricultural research,agricultural\n            technology,alluvial soils,alluvium,annual runoff,Asian\n            Development Bank,average annual\n            rainfall,Basin,canals,cassava,clay,clay soils,coastal\n            areas,coastal plains,coconut,construction,consumptive\n            use,Cooperatives,cotton,Crop,crop\n            production,Cropping,Cropping Patterns,crops,cultivated\n            land,cultivation,dam,dam\n            construction,Dikes,discharge,Ditches,diversion,drain,Drainage,drainage\n            system,drains,drought,dry season,export,Farm,farm\n            employment,Farm Incomes,farm\n            irrigation,farmers,farming,farms,flood control,flood\n            plain,flood plains,flooding,floods,growth in\n            agriculture,heavy rainfall,heavy soils,hydroelectric\n            power,HYV,Irrigated Agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,labor force,land\n            use,lands,maize,navigation,paddy,permits,planting,pollution,produce,pumping,rainfall,rainfed\n            areas,regulated flow,rice,rice crop,rice prices,rice\n            production,rice varieties,river basins,rivers,salinity,salt\n            water,sea,service area,small\n            dams,Soils,spacing,streams,sugarcane,tobacco,water\n            resources,water resources development,Water Supply,water use,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,agricultural labor,AGRICULTURAL\n            PRODUCTION,agricultural research,agricultural\n            technology,alluvial soils,alluvium,annual runoff,Asian\n            Development Bank,average annual\n            rainfall,Basin,canals,cassava,clay,clay soils,coastal\n            areas,coastal plains,coconut,construction,consumptive\n            use,Cooperatives,cotton,Crop,crop\n            production,Cropping,Cropping Patterns,crops,cultivated\n            land,cultivation,dam,dam\n            construction,Dikes,discharge,Ditches,diversion,drain,Drainage,drainage\n            system,drains,drought,dry season,export,Farm,farm\n            employment,Farm Incomes,farm\n            irrigation,farmers,farming,farms,flood control,flood\n            plain,flood plains,flooding,floods,growth in\n            agriculture,heavy rainfall,heavy soils,hydroelectric\n            power,HYV,Irrigated Agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,labor force,land\n            use,lands,maize,navigation,paddy,permits,planting,pollution,produce,pumping,rainfall,rainfed\n            areas,regulated flow,rice,rice crop,rice prices,rice\n            production,rice varieties,river basins,rivers,salinity,salt\n            water,sea,service area,small\n            dams,Soils,spacing,streams,sugarcane,tobacco,water\n            resources,water resources development,Water Supply,water use,Yields"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"3277"},"facets":{}}}
