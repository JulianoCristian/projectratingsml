Both the Bank, and\n            Borrower performances were unsatisfactory, though mixed,\n            given that although the project was responsive to high\n            priorities for reform, with a supervision capable of\n            redirecting the project as needed, the Bank's delayed\n            objections during implementation, lead to an extremely slow\n            public procurement process by the Government. Lessons\n            reinforce the need for Government commitment during project\n            design, and implementation, particularly in assigning\n            project managerial responsibilities with political backing,\n            and the authority and stature to implement mandates.\n            Moreover, appropriate institutional arrangements are crucial\n            for managing the reform process, thus reform activities\n            should be mainstreamed as of the early stages of the\n            project, involving all players, from the highest political\n            level, through senior public services management, to the\n            professional, and technical levels, with sustained support\n            from counterpart Ministries, and Departments. The importance\n            of a coherent policy design - and politically supported -\n            should be highlighted, for a consistent personnel, and pay\n            policy covering all public sector employees, would have\n            avoided the conflict - as it so happened - that the gains\n            from reducing the size of the civil service, were offset by\n            increases in the wage bill for the teachers. Finally, to\n            achieve a scheduled procurement, particularly when several\n            Ministries or Departments are engaged in project\n            implementation, institutional arrangements should be ensured\n            for the management of the project, within effective\n            structures, and processes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Institutional Development and Civil\n            Service Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Institutional Development\n            and Civil Service Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/03/1121287/kenya-institutional-development-civil-service-reform-project","projn":"KE-Inst.
