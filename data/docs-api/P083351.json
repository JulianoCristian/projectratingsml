Some\n            lessons learned included: in the absence of stability,\n            leadership and ownership at the central government level,\n            project implementation can still be effective if engagement\n            at local government levels is high and there is strong\n            project management. Sufficient institutional support and\n            governance capacity building should be integrated into\n            growth poles projects to promote their durability and\n            replicability.

The report comprises a social assessment and\n            cultural policy framework, identifies environmental impacts,\n            and proposes mitigation measures aimed at integrating\n            environmental and social dimensions into regional\n            development, specifically, into the medium- and long-term\n            development endeavors of each of the poles. It ensures that\n            tourism development is sustainable in environmental and\n            social terms. It also seeks to rationalize future\n            subprojects. Anticipated impacts include soil erosion and\n            sedimentation, loss of biodiversity, coral destruction due\n            to starfish proliferation, water contamination from human\n            pollutants, economic loss, disappearance of animal species,\n            and, restricted access to land for the population and\n            traffic congestion, further diminution of cultivable land,\n            destruction of ancient buildings and homes, degradation of\n            the marine environment and beaches from tourism activities,\n            air pollution, disrespect of cultural taboos and moral\n            values, and loss of cultural identity and increased sexual\n            tourism. Some recommended mitigations include: signage and\n            traffic management, installing drainage systems, building\n            repair, land use management, public education and publicity\n            campaigns about the risks of sexually transmitted diseases,\n            promotion of public health, protection of water resources,\n            installing latrines, privatizing garbage collection,\n            feasibility studies on incineration, composting and biogas\n            production, installing mechanisms to control air pollution\n            including dust dispersion, scheduling work during normal\n            business hours, repairing and maintaining transport\n            vehicles, using other means to minimize noise such as\n            planting a greenbelt along transport corridors, restoring\n            land and woods, carefully handling hazardous substances,\n            avoiding traveling through water courses, conserving\n            vegetation, planning for emergencies, locating work camps at\n            a reasonable distance from villages, and involving local\n            authorities in operational activities and ensuring\n            women's representation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Etude d'impact environnemental : Projet\n            de site de decharge pour dechets solides dans la commune de\n            Nosy Be"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Integrated Growth\n            Poles Project : social  and environmental impact assessment\n            (Vol. 21) : Etude d'impact environnemental : Projet de\n            site de decharge pour dechets solides dans la commune de\n            Nosy Be"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/03/18180938/madagascar-integrated-growth-poles-project-social-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-21-etude-dimpact-environnemental-projet-de-site-de-decharge-pour-dechets-solides-dans-la-commune-de-nosy","count":"Madagascar","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"APA, biodiversity, diffusion, PPP,\n            vegetation, who, cyclones, diffusion, effluents, inflation,\n            adults, air, apathy, civil society, climate, communities,\n            districts, economic development, families, habitat, health\n            care, health care workers, households, housing, human\n            rights, hygiene, income, inhabitants, intervention, land\n            use, laws, legal framework, local populations, migration,\n            natural heritage, natural resources, non-governmental\n            organizations, partnership, population growth, private\n            sector, public participation, public safety, quality of\n            life, regional development, regional planning, regulatory\n            framework, rehabilitation, resettlement, rural communities,\n            social conditions, social studies, sustainable development,\n            towns, traffic, transportation, unemployment, Urban\n            Planning, urbanization, waste, waste disposal, water supply,\n            workers, environmental management, environment, social\n            impact assessment, vulnerable groups"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Urban development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"R\u00e9publique de Madagascar - Projet P\u00f4les\n            Int\u00e9gr\u00e9s de Croissance"}},"projn":"MG-Integrated Growth Poles -- P083351","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Urban Housing,Business Environment,Land Use and Policies,Business in Development,Economic Growth","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Urban Development","authors":{"authr":"Tecsult International Limitee"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20130902115445"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East and North Africa!$!119229"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East and North Africa!$!119229"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East and North Africa!$!119229"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"General energy sector,General public administration sector,General industry and trade sector,Other industry,General transportation sector","theme":"Other urban development,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Trade & Compet - GP - IBRD (GTCDR)","trustfund":"TF053316-PHRD-MADAGASCAR: INTEGRAED\n            GROWTH POLES PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East and North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East and North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East and North Africa"}},"repnb":"E1118"},"facets":{}}}
