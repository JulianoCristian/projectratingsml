Some lessons\n            learned included: in the case of early project closure, the\n            Bank should give due attention to the sustainability of\n            activities. An exit strategy prepared jointly with all\n            stakeholders, discussing options for maintenance and\n            securing future funding sources, should be a priority\n            activity before project closing. A multiagency capacity\n            building initiative, especially with respect to safeguards,\n            may be more effective if embedded in an investment project\n            rather than as a stand-alone project. To overcome the\n            complexity of multiagency projects, strong leadership and\n            simple project design can play critical roles. A balance\n            needs to be established to strengthen, on the one hand,\n            multi-agency coordination inherent for the management of\n            social and environmental safeguard issues and promote\n            country ownership, while ensuring, on the other hand, a\n            limited complex institutional arrangement to allow adequate\n            support and monitoring by the Project Implementation Unit,\n            or PIU and the WB task team. To start initially with fewer\n            implementing agencies can be more effective in particular in\n            countries with limited capacity and a weak implementation\n            record. Multi-sectoral projects also suggest to be better\n            placed under the Prime Minister's Office to manage\n            various stakeholders instead of one sectoral Ministry, such\n            as the Ministry of Environment and Nature Protection, or\n            MinEP. Additionally, the success of a multi-stakeholder\n            approach depends on the strong leadership needed to ensure\n            guidance, oversight, and capitalizing on experiences."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Environmental and Social Capacity\n            Building for the Energy Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Environmental and\n

development objective of the\n            Environmental and Social Capacity Building for the Energy\n            Sector Project for Cameroon is to improve the management of\n            and the accountability for environmental and social issues\n            related to large infrastructure investments, with an initial\n            focus on the energy sector. The project will initially focus\n            capacity building efforts towards the energy sector, in\n            support of the Energy Sector Development Project. The\n            mobilization of supplemental resources to more explicitly\n            address issues in the mining and transport sectors will be\n            explored during the project's midterm review. The\n            expected long-term benefits of the project are to: (i)\n            reduce the negative externalities of large infrastructure\n            projects; (ii) develop a transparent, stable and fair\n            framework for managing environmental and social risks that\n            can improve the enabling environment for large\n            infrastructure investments; and (iii) institutionalizes\n            information flows between the populations affected by large\n            infrastructure projects and other stakeholders, and\n            political decision-makers. The project will include the\n            following three components: (i) strengthening the ministry\n            in charge of the environment to fulfill its mandate to\n            define, monitor and control environmental and social\n            obligations of large infrastructure project, in compliance\n            with the environmental law of 1996 and its implementation\n            decrees; (ii) establishing frameworks to manage social\n            externalities associated with large infrastructure projects,\n            in compliance with international best practices; and (iii)\n            supporting the environment unit in the ministry of energy\n            and water to ensure that the environmental and social issues\n            arising from large energy sector infrastructure projects are\n            addressed in compliance with international best practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
