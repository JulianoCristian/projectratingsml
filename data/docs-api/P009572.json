Some of the lessons\n            learned are: 1) lengthy initial implementation delays\n            largely attributed to civil works point to the importance of\n            careful start-up planning and implementation; 2) the Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU's) steady integration within\n            division of education (DOE) enhanced implementation and\n            increased efficiency and has helped to foster borrower\n            ownership; 3) high quality external training courses and\n            well matched fellowship placements pay dividends over\n            lower-cost options; 4) like other projects of the time,\n            there were no monitor able indicators per se, although the\n            end objectives were largely used to assess progress by Royal\n            Government of Bhutan (RGOB) and missions, particularly at\n            the mid-term review (MTR) stage; 5) to achieve sustainable\n            skills transfer from technical assistance experts, it is\n            critical that national counterparts are carefully identified\n            and selected. International experts should also be carefully\n            chosen to ensure they are capable and willing to adapt to\n            local conditions and relate effectively with their\n            counterparts; and 6) the DOE' s reluctance to\n            compromise on teacher quality for the sake of expediency is\n            noteworthy and has sent a strong message to the system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Primary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - Primary Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/731635/bhutan-primary-education-project","projn":"BT-Education -- P009572","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Bhutan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980901092643"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Primary education,Tertiary education,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,adaptation,addition,administrative\n            authority,basic education,basic needs,boarding,boarding\n            facilities,boarding schools,classrooms,community\n            schools,counseling,curricula,Curriculum,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,decentralization of\n            education,Development Program,distance to\n            school,drawing,economic development,education\n            administration,education quality,Education Sector,education\n            services,education system,Educational\n            Administration,Educational\n            opportunities,employment,engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            growth,enrollment rates,enrollment targets,female\n            students,geography,girls,gross enrollment,gross enrollment\n            ratio,head teachers,Institutional\n            development,isolation,mid-term review,national\n            commitment,overall enrollment,parity,Partnership,personnel\n            management,Pre-service teacher training,Primary\n            Education,primary enrollment,Primary School,primary school\n            enrollment,primary school facilities,primary school\n            teachers,primary schooling,primary schools,primary\n            teachers,Private sector,professional development,Public\n            sector,quality education,quality of education,rural\n            population,school construction,School\n            Management,schooling,Secondary Education,secondary\n            level,secondary students,student achievement,Teacher,Teacher\n            Deployment,teacher education,teacher educators,teacher\n            quality,teacher shortage,teacher supply,Teacher\n            Training,Teacher Training Colleges,teaching,training\n            courses,training programs,Universal Primary\n            Education,UPE,urban areas,vocational training,walking,women teachers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,adaptation,addition,administrative\n            authority,basic education,basic needs,boarding,boarding\n            facilities,boarding schools,classrooms,community\n            schools,counseling,curricula,Curriculum,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,decentralization of\n            education,Development Program,distance to\n            school,drawing,economic development,education\n            administration,education quality,Education Sector,education\n            services,education system,Educational\n            Administration,Educational\n            opportunities,employment,engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            growth,enrollment rates,enrollment targets,female\n            students,geography,girls,gross enrollment,gross enrollment\n            ratio,head teachers,Institutional\n            development,isolation,mid-term review,national\n            commitment,overall enrollment,parity,Partnership,personnel\n            management,Pre-service teacher training,Primary\n            Education,primary enrollment,Primary School,primary school\n            enrollment,primary school facilities,primary school\n            teachers,primary schooling,primary schools,primary\n            teachers,Private sector,professional development,Public\n            sector,quality education,quality of education,rural\n            population,school construction,School\n            Management,schooling,Secondary Education,secondary\n            level,secondary students,student achievement,Teacher,Teacher\n            Deployment,teacher education,teacher educators,teacher\n            quality,teacher shortage,teacher supply,Teacher\n            Training,Teacher Training Colleges,teaching,training\n            courses,training programs,Universal Primary\n            Education,UPE,urban areas,vocational training,walking,women teachers"}},"owner":"S.A.
