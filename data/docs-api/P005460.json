However, the social assessment demonstrated\n            that the project should be seen in a better light, if only\n            because the colleges are likely to improve over time, as\n            they reach their \"cruising speed\" and the\n            communities they serve adapt to the new context. Key lessons\n            included: Support from senior government officials\n            throughout the project is critical; the absence of a clear\n            strategic orientation and the very uneven support given the\n            project by senior government officials clearly had the\n            effect of diverting the attention of staff involved in the\n            project toward other priorities. The choice of a site--an\n            issue neglected during project preparation--is essential to\n            the success of a college in a rural setting: the siting of a\n            college must follow, not precede, investment in other\n            infrastructure. Community contributions must not be ignored,\n            even in countries where traditions of local participation\n            are not strong. Local authorities must be given the\n            resources to enter into agreements with parent associations\n            or nongovernmental organizations in ways that involve the\n            latter in managing the college. Putting additional resources\n            into the building program cannot compensate for the lack of\n            activities designed to improve the quality of instruction.\n            In this project, the failure to develop a teacher training\n            program specific to rural areas, and the poor performance of\n            the two technical assistance activities undoubtedly weakened\n            the project's impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Rural Basic Education Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Rural Basic Education\n            Development
