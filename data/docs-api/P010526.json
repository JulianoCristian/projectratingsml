Sustainability of the\n            project is likely. Overall, the World Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower performance is rated\n            satisfactory because with strong Borrower efforts during the\n            second implementation phase, the project achieved most of\n            its objectives. Several lessons were learned from this\n            project: For successful implementation, new directions such\n            as in the NCD component, and program reorientation as in the\n            nutrition component, require extensive consultations and a\n            broad consensus among the key stakeholders. Consultation\n            with the key implementation staff is necessary. Procurement\n            is often critical to the success of HNP projects.\n            Complementarities and synergies among vertical programs\n            should be identified and exploited. A responsive field\n            presence is necessary. Attention to administrative issues is\n            needed at the start. PMUs that lack strong support from the\n            ministry leadership, have limited management effectiveness.\n            Previous lessons should be internalized into project design.\n            Financial management capacity is a prerequisite. Contracting\n            for services requires special skills and shifts in the\n            institutional culture. Traditional public sector culture is\n            not conducive to working with nongovernmental organizations.\n            Proper monitoring indicators are essential.
