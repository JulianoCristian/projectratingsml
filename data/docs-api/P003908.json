At the same time, it aims to lay the groundwork\n            for a major reorientation of commercial, operational and\n            maintenance practices that should enable PJKA to become\n            financially viable over a seven- to eight-year period.  To\n            that end, the project entails four components.  First, the\n            project involves (a) technical assistance to PJKA in the\n            following areas:  a comprehensive management information\n            system, costing, procurement and inventory control, train\n            scheduling, and rationalization of mechanical and track\n            maintenance.  Further to this, it provides (b) training of\n            railway staff and (c) acquisition of equipment for handling\n            containers and intermodal traffic, a few pieces of\n            maintenance and miscellaneous equipment, and computer\n            hardware and software for a management information system.\n            Finally, the project includes (d) minor physical\n            improvements, such as paving of yards, to facilitate\n            container and intermodal traffic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Railway Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Railway Technical\n            Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/10/739780/indonesia-railway-technical-assistance-project","projn":"ID-Railways Ta -- P003908","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,ICT Policy and Strategies,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Railways Transport","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970702134728"},"subsc":"Railways","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,acquisition,auditors,billing,bridge,bridges,budget\n            control,capital expenditures,carrying\n            capacity,Cement,Cities,Civil works,commuter rail,competitive\n            bidding,computer equipment,computer hardware,cost\n            analysis,cost savings,diesel\n            locomotives,dolomite,fares,financial data,financial\n            statements,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,freight,freight\n            rates,freight service,freight traffic,freight\n            wagons,fuel,grade,Highway\n            Maintenance,Highways,Housing,inventory,Land\n            Transport,Leasing,locomotives,maintenance\n            costs,marketing,operating costs,passenger,passenger\n            coaches,passenger fares,paving,Ports,procurement,public\n            enterprises,purchasing,radio,rail,rail operations,rail\n            services,rail system,Railway,railway equipment,railway\n            operations,Railway Project,railway staff,railway\n            system,railways,Rate of Return,road traffic,road\n            transport,rolling stock,Rural\n            Roads,safety,sales,savings,sleepers,speed,stations,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunications,track,traffic,traffic\n            growth,transportation,Urban Development,Urban\n            Transport,Water Supply,welding"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,acquisition,auditors,billing,bridge,bridges,budget\n            control,capital expenditures,carrying\n            capacity,Cement,Cities,Civil works,commuter rail,competitive\n            bidding,computer equipment,computer hardware,cost\n            analysis,cost savings,diesel\n            locomotives,dolomite,fares,financial data,financial\n            statements,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,freight,freight\n            rates,freight service,freight traffic,freight\n            wagons,fuel,grade,Highway\n            Maintenance,Highways,Housing,inventory,Land\n            Transport,Leasing,locomotives,maintenance\n            costs,marketing,operating costs,passenger,passenger\n            coaches,passenger fares,paving,Ports,procurement,public\n            enterprises,purchasing,radio,rail,rail operations,rail\n            services,rail system,Railway,railway equipment,railway\n            operations,Railway Project,railway staff,railway\n            system,railways,Rate of Return,road traffic,road\n            transport,rolling stock,Rural\n            Roads,safety,sales,savings,sleepers,speed,stations,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunications,track,traffic,traffic\n            growth,transportation,Urban Development,Urban\n            Transport,Water Supply,welding"}},"owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"P4396"},"facets":{}}}
