Following are several\n            lessons from the project experience. Enhancing institutional\n            capacity of the recipient agency in several competencies -\n            road maintenance, implementation of highway projects,\n            traffic management, and road transport sector training\n            systems - were project objectives, and an integral part of\n            the project and the Credit Agreement. However, the Ministry\n            of Transport (MOT) was reticent in approving technical\n            assistance, only few activities were approved and\n            implemented, and training only started at the later part of\n            the project, therefore not achieving the institutional\n            capacity building as planned. Rather, support to capacity\n            building should only take place after careful consideration,\n            and discussion with the agencies involved, its design should\n            be well advanced during project preparation, including\n            defined performance indicators, and intermediate results\n            linked to project outcomes, with emphasis on government\n            ownership. MOT needs to improve its ability to plan, budget\n            and monitor maintenance activities, to facilitate\n            preservation, and improve access for road users, taking into\n            account its Ten-year Strategic Maintenance Plan, when\n            preparing annual work programs. Other lessons address the\n            need to strengthen the role of the Supervision Engineer;\n            and, for design and construction standards consistent with\n            project objectives, through planning and programming\n            processes for road maintenance, further enhanced with\n            capacity building and standards for maintenance works,\n            adopted as a prerequisite for any future road maintenance\n            program. It is highlighted that environmental and\n            resettlement monitoring should be independent from the\n            project, with a framework consistent with internationally\n            recognized practices for design, implementation, and\n            operation of road projects. Finally, and although for nearly\n            a decade, restructuring and privatization of state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs) has been occurring, there is however the\n            need for equity programs to improve the operational and\n            financial performance of SOEs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Viet Nam - Second Highway Rehabilitation

The specific project objectives are: to\n            reduce transport costs through improved national road\n            infrastructure, particularly, Highway No. 1;  to enhance the\n            efficiency by road sector institutions in periodic\n            maintenance of the national road network; to reduce vehicle\n            overloading and improve traffic safety; and to enhance the\n            Ministry of Transport and Communications' institutional\n            capacity in environmental impact assessment and monitoring.\n            The project will comprise the following components:  (1)\n            Road maintenance and rehabilitation -this includes\n            reconstructing the Vinh-Dong Ha section of National Highway\n            No. 1, reconstructing two major bridges at Chanh Hoa and\n            Quan Hau; acquiring land, resettling and rehabilitating\n            project-affected people, and providing supervision\n            consultant services;  (2) Periodic maintenance of selected\n            priority national roads -this aims at systematic, periodic\n            maintenance of national highways by contract, and\n            implementation of the new road maintenance management system\n            being developed under the on-going first highway\n            rehabilitation project;  (3)   Improvement of hazardous road\n            sections -selected critical sections of national highways\n            will be improved based on the Vietnam Road Safety\n            Improvement Study made under the first highway\n            rehabilitation project, and will include measures to improve\n            traffic safety like providing adequate road furniture,\n            signs, and traffic management facilities;  (4) Support to\n            the Project Management Unit for Highway No. 1 (PMU1) -this\n            will further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of\n            PMU1 to manage highway projects by purchasing vehicles and\n            office equipment, construct an operating center, and give\n            technical support for project implementation, monitoring and\n            evaluation functions, operation cost, staff training, and\n            support for environmental impact assessment;  (5) Support to\n            the Vietnam Road Administration (VRA) and the Regional Road\n            Management Unions (RRMU) -this will enhance institutional\n            capacity by providing additional maintenance equipment for\n            RRMUs and axle load weighing stations and equipment for VRA;\n            (6) Training -this will train the trainers for the transport\n            sector training system, strengthen local institutions, and\n            enhance the skills of highway sector manpower;   (7)\n            Detailed design and engineering studies -this includes the\n            design and engineering study of two road sections and\n            detailed design and preparation of bid documents
