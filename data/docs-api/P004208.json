The overall\n            goal of the project was to strengthen the basis for the\n            long-term sustainable economic and social development of the\n            Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).  In broad\n            terms, the project has contributed significantly to the\n            achievement of the objectives defined in the Staff Appraisal\n            Report (SAR) and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA).\n            Lessons learned include:  the use of a preparation grant and\n            a pilot project with bridging finance helped to develop\n            continuity and the early accumulation of practical\n            experience in new techniques and practices where the legal,\n            policy and practical frameworks were at best ill-defined and\n            at worst nonexistent; wherever possible, the objectives of a\n            project should be made as specific as possible and should be\n            defined in discrete and quantifiable terms; it is essential\n            to prepare a base-line study either as part of project\n            preparation or as soon thereafter as possible; the provision\n            of counterpart funds in an adequate amount and a timely\n            fashion is essential to effective project implementation;\n            where significant change and growth is required in public\n            sector institutions as a necessary condition for project or\n            program success, a careful and pragmatic strategy of\n            institutional development is required including the\n            requirements for development and training of human\n            resources; the use of modern technology in projects of this\n            kind is clearly superior to, and more efficient than, older\n            techniques; the indications of malpractices in the\n            implementation of the project lead to the conclusion that\n            other projects under implementation should be subjected to\n            an in-depth review; if studies are considered at appraisal\n            to be important, their preparation should be pursued\n            energetically during project implementation; the experience\n            of the project demonstrates the importance of out-reach\n            activities where significant changes in culture or\n            traditional practices are concerned; the creation of a\n            complete land administration system is an enormous\n            undertaking that must be expected to take decades to\n            achieve; and in this project, a strong case could have been\n

The project will\n            support the first seven years of a longer term national land\n            titling program aimed at extending secure land ownership and\n            developing land administration and valuation systems,\n            including compiling a cadastral mapping system.

development. In confirmation with this\n            goal, the objectives of the project are to foster the\n            development of efficient land markets and to facilitate\n            domestic resource mobilization by providing a system of\n            clear and enforceable land use ownership rights, and by\n            developing a land valuation capacity. The project will\n            support the first seven years of a longer term national land\n            titling program aimed at extending secure land ownership and\n            developing land administration and valuation systems,\n            including compiling a cadastral mapping system. The main\n            components of the project are: 1) completion of the policy\n            and legal framework for land management and administration;\n            2) implementation of an accelerated land titling program; 3)\n            improvements in the infrastructure, facilities and systems\n            for land administration; 4) improvements in land valuation;\n            5) support for project management and implementation, and\n            institutional strengthening; and 6) studies on community\n            land tenure and registration, definition of forest\n            boundaries, cost recovery, land rights issues on\n            nationalized lands and socio-economic impact of land titling."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Laos - Land Titling Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Laos - Land Titling Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/02/735047/laos-land-titling-project","projn":"LA-Land Titling -- P004208","subtopic":"Urban Housing,Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Environmental Economics & Policies,Land Use and Policies,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development,Environment,Urban Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008054556"},"subsc":"Other Public Administration, Law and Justice,Sub-National Government,Central Government","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development,Environment,Urban Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Civil Engineer,civil\n            service,communal land,communities,comparative\n            advantage,Construction,debt,decision\n            making,drainage,economic activity,Economic growth,economic\n            impact,environmental management,exchange rate,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,Forest\n            Management,Forestry,Housing,Housing Management,Housing\n            Management Offices,income,key performance indicators,land\n            acquisition,land administration,land improvement,land\n            management,land markets,land ownership,land reform,land\n            registration,land rights,land taxes,land tenure,land\n            titles,Land Titling,land transactions,land use,land\n            valuation,land values,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,lending institutions,local\n            government,Ministries of Finance,natural resources,policy\n            decisions,poverty alleviation,real estate,real estate\n            taxes,Recurrent Expenditures,resource mobilization,rural\n            areas,sites,soil conservation,state enterprises,sustainable\n            use,tax administration,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,TOWNS,Transport,urban areas"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Civil Engineer,civil\n            service,communal land,communities,comparative\n            advantage,Construction,debt,decision\n            making,drainage,economic activity,Economic growth,economic\n            impact,environmental management,exchange rate,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,Forest\n            Management,Forestry,Housing,Housing Management,Housing\n            Management Offices,income,key performance indicators,land\n            acquisition,land administration,land improvement,land\n            management,land markets,land ownership,land reform,land\n            registration,land rights,land taxes,land tenure,land\n            titles,Land Titling,land transactions,land use,land\n            valuation,land values,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,lending institutions,local\n            government,Ministries of Finance,natural resources,policy\n            decisions,poverty alleviation,real estate,real estate\n            taxes,Recurrent Expenditures,resource mobilization,rural\n            areas,sites,soil conservation,state enterprises,sustainable\n            use,tax administration,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,TOWNS,Transport,urban areas"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020287-PILOT LAND TITLING PROJECT,TF022734-PHRD-LAND TITLING PROJECT","repnb":"P6681"},"facets":{}}}
