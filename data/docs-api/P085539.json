The multi-sectoral and multi-facted\n            design of the project was overly complex for the Costa Rican\n            context. Given the poor performance of the project, options\n            for full or partial cancellation were considered during the\n            last three years of implementation. The monitoring and\n            evaluation design was considered dismal and inadequate.\n            While the project complied with the Bank's policy and\n            procedural requirements, the overall procurement\n            arrangements were moderately unsatisfactory. The next phase\n            of the project will involve authorities undertaking efforts\n            to consolidate arrangements for operational maintenance of\n            the assets created under the project. The overall outcome\n            rating given was 'Highly Unsatisfactory.' The\n            assessment of risk to development outcome was rated\n            'High'; the overall bank performance an\n            'Unsatisfactory'; and overall borrower performance\n            an 'Unsatisfactory.' The lessons learned from this\n            project confirm that the success of failure of a project\n            reaching its development objectives is determined by the\n            quality of the project's conceptual design, its\n            organizational arrangements, and the institutional\n            coordination adopted. Multi-sector projects require a strong\n            and effective interagency coordination backed by top level\n            Government endorsement and accountability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica -

The City-Port of Limon project was approved in\n            January 2008 and declared effective in October 2009. Given\n            the time lag between project approval and the initiation of\n            project implementation, specific provisions within the Loan\n            Agreement (LA) need to be corrected, updated or reviewed in\n            order to ensure an adequate project implementation. Project\n            implementation has seen initial shortfalls, with no major\n            disbursements to date. The delays in project execution can\n            be partially attributed to: (i) the overall institutional\n            complexity of the project, which involves different\n            institutional set-ups for each of the eleven project\n            activities, reflected in inter-institutional agreements, and\n            each of which constitutes a specific disbursement condition;\n            (ii) delays in the full establishment of the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU), due to changes in leadership,\n            bottlenecks in the staffing process, shortfalls in\n            counterpart funding and weaknesses regarding operational\n            procedures and monitoring and evaluation tools in place; and\n            (iii) the political transition, with new authorities\n            entering office in May 2010, and the resulting repercussions\n            on many of the institutions directly and indirectly involved\n            in project execution, among others. However, since October\n            2010, considerable progress has been made in the signing of\n            inter-institutional agreements, complying with disbursement\n            conditions under priority project activities. The\n            restructuring has no implications in terms of environmental\n            and social safeguards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica -
