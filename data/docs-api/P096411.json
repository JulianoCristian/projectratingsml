Some lessons\n            learned included: design of the budget supports needs to be\n            adapted to the institutional environment. In a weak\n            institutional environment such as Niger, it is better to\n            avoid a long list of prior actions, and focus instead on a\n            short list of key actions and their cross-sectoral linkages\n            and synergies. It is important to provide a medium-term\n            perspective, particularly when addressing policy constraints\n            in sectors, where results are not achieved in the\n            short-term. In that respect, the decision to discontinue the\n            series of three rural and social policy reform operations\n            and move to other sectors before gains in the initial\n            sectors are fully consolidated is perplexing. This decision\n            may give the Government the wrong signal that pursuing the\n            reforms in the human development area is no longer needed.\n            The Development Policy Lending (DPL) series demonstrated\n            that satisfactory outcomes can be achieved with strong\n            commitment on the part of government and with Bank support\n            designed to develop the needed capacity for implementation.\n            This is particularly evident in the education, health, and\n            to a lesser extent in agriculture sectors, where authorities\n            are committed to improve capacities and increase efficiency\n            of service delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - First and Second Rural and Social\n            Policy Credit/Grant

The memorandum\n            argues that the Government of Niger has made satisfactory\n            progress overall in implementing the program supported by\n            the credit as set forth in its Letter of Development Policy\n            and has fully met eight of the nine prior actions for\n            release of the second tranche.

Given the shortage of qualified available health\n            staff; this gap could not be filled, but the provision is\n            waived based on Niger's efforts in still trying to meet\n

and Social Policy Reform\n            Credit Development Policy Lending (DPL) Project, as part of\n            a series of two to three operations, aims to help the\n            Government of Niger improve service delivery to the poor,\n            while continuing reforms in public sector management to\n            secure adequate financing in critical sectors of the\n            economy. Within this medium-term framework, and building on\n            the previous three budget support operations, as well as\n            ongoing investment projects in agriculture, education, and\n            health, the project will focus on selected policy and\n            institutional aspects towards a) improving public sector\n            management, through expansion of reforms in public\n            expenditure management - increasing links between budget\n            allocations and Government priorities, strengthening\n            sectoral ministries' involvement in budget regulation\n            and cash management, modernizing the Treasury, and,\n            strengthening budget controls; and b) enhancing the national\n            statistical information system, ensuring the preparation of\n            national surveys on a regular basis. The project will also\n            promote rural development and agricultural growth through\n            programs implementation within the rural development\n            strategy, promote local governance of natural resources\n            (agricultural land, irrigation water), adopt a single\n            medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), and, release the\n            funds allocated in the 2006 budget to ensure adequate food\n            availability during the pre-harvest period. Furthermore,\n            improvements in service delivery in social sectors will be\n            enhanced through an adequate human resource management.\n            Budget preparation and execution will be improved, as will\n            accountability and governance at the school level, and the\n            provision of publicly financed basic health services to the\n            poor and vulnerable groups."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Rural and Social Policy Reform\n            Credit Development Policy Lending (DPL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Rural and
