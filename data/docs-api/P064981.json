Some lessons learned\n            included: projects should not underestimate the difficulty\n            in implementing activities in the water sector in Yemen\n            given the number, organizational structure, and weakness in\n            capacity of Government of Yemen (GOY) institutions involved\n            in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).\n            Demonstration of new irrigation technologies to improve\n            irrigation efficiency in pilot farms was very effective in\n            expanding modern irrigation in rural Yemen. Projects should\n            avoid establishing legal conditions or requirements that are\n            clearly beyond the scope of the project to deliver. Timely\n            action will have been better in recognizing the need for\n            amending the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) when it was\n            decided (2007) to consider farmer installation of localized\n            irrigation equipment using equipment supply contracts, with\n            outcome-based incentive structure for farmers. This new\n            mechanism for transferring the responsibility of installing\n            conveyance and distribution system to farmers worked very\n            well with improvement in the pace of installation. It is\n            crucial for the Management to be involved in resolving the\n            institutional issues of the Government in the early stage of\n            the project implementation. GOY officials should be fully\n            involved from project identification to appraisal phases.\n            Involvement of national consultants during these stages as\n            counterparts to the foreign consultants would lighten the\n            burden of GOY officials but the chance of on-the-job\n            training of GOY officials would be lost, which would result\n            in delay in project start-up due to lack of capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen - Sana'a Basin Water\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Yemen -

in\n            containing the depletion of groundwater in the Sana'a\n            Basin aquifer, a timing which will allow for the conversion\n            of the Basin's economy into less water-intensive\n            activities, while favorable socioeconomic conditions will be\n            encouraged through community participation. The first\n            component seeks to achieve water savings, and conservation\n            in agriculture, by increasing irrigation uses through\n            physical interventions in upgrading piped delivery systems,\n            converting open channels to piped delivery systems, and\n            introducing pressurized irrigation, promoting community\n            participation. The second component will accelerate\n            groundwater recharge, through small conventional dams,\n            sub-surface dams, and other structures. Given the flaws of\n            the Water Law, the third component will help develop a\n            regulatory framework, to subsequently apply regulatory\n            procedures for water rights management, and, the National\n            Water Resources Authority will assume the responsibility for\n            basin-wide water resources investigation, regulation, and\n            monitoring. Moreover, a basin hydro-geological and water\n            resources investigation, and monitoring will aim at\n            analyzing project impacts on dam, and wadi structures\n            regarding aquifer recharge, and groundwater levels,\n            including as well, surveys, laboratory testing, and\n            satellite imagery/aerial photography to quantify impacts on\n            crops and irrigated areas. The fourth, fifth and sixth\n            components, will promote public awareness campaigns,\n            environmental management, and mitigation plans, and, support\n            project management

It applies to private and communal\n            lands or properties affected throughout the Sana'a\n            Basin Water Management Project. In particular, it addresses\n            how the government will identify, mitigate, and compensate\n            any adverse impacts on the assets and liveihoods of the\n            people directly affected by possible expropriations. It is\n            intended to safeguard the interests of the population\n            impacted by the project, especially the poor and vulnerable.\n            This Framework also decribes the required organizational\n            arrangements and design criteria to be applied to\n            subprojects during project implementation and the procedures\n            and content of any abbreviated or full resettlement action\n            plans if and as required. The report also analyzes\n            Yemen's legislation governing property and\n            participation; because of the weakness of the judicial\n            system and the presence and prevalence of tribal law, it is\n            necessary that the framework take the social context into\n            account and adapt it to local conditions. if the proposed\n            sub-project design entails any impacts on land or assets,\n            the design shall be reviewed and revised based on the\n            appropriate and documented consultations with affected\n            persons, and with the aim of avoiding or minimizing\n            expropriation and adverse socio-economic impacts. the\n            submission of a Land Acquisition plan and its approval by\n            the world Bank is a condition that must be met prior to\n            subproject approval and the initiation of any works.\n            Abbreviated resettlement plan procedures shall be made\n            publicly available in Arabic and other media as appropriate,\n            and in locations accessible to the affected people. In cases\n            where a sub-project will incur involuntary resettlement or\n            other significant or large-scale impacts, a full\n            resettlement action plan has to be prepared, which will\n            entail more in-depth studies than in the abbreviated plan.\n            Regardless of the issues of land acquisition or loss of\n            assets, in the Sana'a Basin project consultation with\n            the beneficiaries befire the design of any sub-projects is\n            of critical importance . Because water is a common asset\n            subject to tribal regulations the arrangements and\n            agreements for the use of water from any dams must be\n            settled before any subprojects are developed and approved.\n            There are instances where water from full dams cannot be\n            used because of local disputes over water, thus the social\n            analysis of the customary water tenancy laws must be clear\n            and agreements established before any subproject is\n            approved.

The objective of rehabilitating\n            existing dams is itself a mitigation measure to address\n            safety hazards. A dam safety expert has visited all sites\n            and preliminarily concluded that the sites and foreseen work\n            would not pose any safety risk. However, an international\n            expert will also be retained to review feasibility studies,\n            final designs, and bidding documents, and to participate in\n            the Mid-Term Review. Recommended non-structural safety\n            measures include installing instrumentation and monitoring\n            devices, operation and maintenance plans, including\n            emergency preparedness plans, and establishing a panel of\n            three national experts, who would supervise final designs\n            and safety measures. During construction, work areas\n            susceptible to erosion will not remain exposed for long\n            periods and sites will be restored to their original\n            contours and revegetated where directed; shoring will be\n            provided if needed in deeper trenches to ensure worker\n            safety; reduce noise by scheduling work during the daytime;\n            water worksites, quarries, and access roads to suppress\n            dust; provide controls to concrete and batching plants to\n            reduce air pollution and pollution of surface and\n            groundwater; distance fueling from watercourses or recharge\n            areas; put controls in place to prevent spillage; and have\n            contractors clean up any accidental spills; employ strict\n            measures for transport, storage, and use of explosives.\n            Where there are archeological finds, cease construction\n            until appropriate procedures for removal or preservation are\n            issued; transplant any rare or endangered species to safe\n            locations; to ensure worker health and safety, provide them\n            safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, suitable\n            clothing, first aid posts, and training in safe work\n            practices. While the consumption of qat, the predominant\n            crop in the Sana'a Basin, raises serious political,\n            social, and public health issues, and its reduction is\n            beyond the scope of this project, its consumption could be\n            made less risky with measures to minimize pesticide\n            residues. This report recommends demonstrating a model\n            integrated pest management plan, regular testing for\n            pesticide residues and farmer education, and monitoring of\n            groundwater quality. There is some danger that the project\n            works will increase the prevalence of schistosomiasis (or\n            bilharzias). In that case, water bodies close to human\n            habitations will be regularly inspected and monitored\n            monthly to detect and identify the breeding of vectors and\n            contain any colonies found through controlled spraying of\n            insecticides and molluscicides. A specialist will oversee\n            heath education and control measures. As for wastewater\n            treatment plant issues, the accumulated dried sludge will be\n            removed to a landfill site; a \"red flag\" system\n            will warn farmers when raw sewage is being bypassed; a\n            farmers will be educated on the hazards of treated and\n            untreated wastewater; and a ban placed on the use of\n            effluent to irrigate vegetables eaten raw."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Executive summary and main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Yemen - Sana'a\n            Basin Water Management Program Project :

of Yemen - Sana'a Basin Water\n            Management Program Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The environmental and social issues\n            raised by the Sana'a Basin water management Program\n            Project for the republic of Yemen are grouped as follows:\n            design issues, including siting; construction issues,\n            especially for dams; operational issues; dam safety issues;\n            sustainability issues, especially water quality; pesticide\n            issues; health issues; wastewater treatment plant issues;\n            and resettlement issues. The objective of rehabilitating\n            existing dams is itself a mitigation measure to address\n            safety hazards. A dam safety expert has visited all sites\n            and preliminarily concluded that the sites and foreseen work\n            would not pose any safety risk. However, an international\n            expert will also be retained to review feasibility studies,\n            final designs, and bidding documents, and to participate in\n            the Mid-Term Review. Recommended non-structural safety\n            measures include installing instrumentation and monitoring\n            devices, operation and maintenance plans, including\n            emergency preparedness plans, and establishing a panel of\n            three national experts, who would supervise final designs\n            and safety measures. During construction, work areas\n            susceptible to erosion will not remain exposed for long\n            periods and sites will be restored to their original\n            contours and revegetated where directed; shoring will be\n            provided if needed in deeper trenches to ensure worker\n            safety; reduce noise by scheduling work during the daytime;\n            water worksites, quarries, and access roads to suppress\n            dust; provide controls to concrete and batching plants to\n            reduce air pollution and pollution of surface and\n            groundwater; distance fueling from watercourses or recharge\n            areas; put controls in place to prevent spillage; and have\n            contractors clean up any accidental spills; employ strict\n            measures for transport, storage, and use of explosives.\n            Where there are archeological finds, cease construction\n            until appropriate procedures for removal or preservation are\n            issued; transplant any rare or endangered species to safe\n            locations; to ensure worker health and safety, provide them\n            safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, suitable\n            clothing, first aid posts, and training in safe work\n            practices. While the consumption of qat, the predominant\n            crop in the Sana'a Basin, raises serious political,\n            social, and public health issues, and its reduction is\n            beyond the scope of this project, its consumption could be\n            made less risky with measures to minimize pesticide\n            residues. This report recommends demonstrating a model\n            integrated pest management plan, regular testing for\n            pesticide residues and farmer education, and monitoring of\n            groundwater quality. There is some danger that the project\n            works will increase the prevalence of schistosomiasis (or\n            bilharzias). In that case, water bodies close to human\n            habitations will be regularly inspected and monitored\n            monthly to detect and identify the breeding of vectors and\n            contain any colonies found through controlled spraying of\n            insecticides and molluscicides. A specialist will oversee\n            heath education and control measures. As for wastewater\n            treatment plant issues, the accumulated dried sludge will be\n            removed to a landfill site; a \"red flag\" system\n            will warn farmers when raw sewage is being bypassed; a\n            farmers will be educated on the hazards of treated and\n            untreated wastewater; and a ban placed on the use of\n            effluent to irrigate vegetables eaten raw."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Annexes"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Yemen -
