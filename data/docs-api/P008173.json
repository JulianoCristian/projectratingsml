The\n            overall performances of both the World Bank and the borrower\n            are rated satisfactory..1) The key lesson learned from this\n            project is the demonstrated importance of adequately\n            targeted Government incentives to promote irrigation\n            development and production diversification into high-value\n            export crops, particularly in an environment that has been\n            traditionally dominated by extensive agriculture and\n            livestock production like Uruguay. 2) In order to maximize\n            the impact and sustainability of financial incentives to\n            promote the expansion of privately-owned irrigation\n            infrastructure, procurement procedures should encourage\n            beneficiary ownership and reduce, or eliminate, reliance on\n            public institutions for O&M.. 3) The project was\n            successful in promoting sustainable agricultural practices\n            among small farmers, through a micro-catchment approach in\n            areas of intensive agriculture and demonstrated the\n            importance of the participatory approach and farmers\n            organizations to a successful natural resources management\n            program. 4) Technical assistance to small farmers can\n            potentially generate numerous problems derived from the\n            relatively short life of the Bank projects and the\n            consequent lack of \"team building\" and common\n            purpose among those involved. Continuity of TA services\n            beyond the duration of the project is therefore\n            essential..5) In addition to agronomists, the establishment\n            of professional teams for the delivery of extension services\n            in programs related to Natural Resources Management\n            (specifically sociologists, engineers and economists),\n            enables a project to be better prepared to respond to\n            multiple demands of producers. 6) The incorporation of\n            private organizations in the implementation of applied\n            research programs increases the possibilities of\n            collaboration between researchers, producers, extensionists,\n            and local institutions, and consequently provides an\n            effective synergism and potentially higher adoption rates.\n            Adequate beneficiary ownership and participation is also\n            instrumental. .7) A holistic approach is key to develop\n            sustainable agricultural production systems among small\n            farmers in order to include other elements relevant to the\n            increase in competitiveness of production, beyond mere\n            productivity, such as awareness of commercial opportunities,\n            product quality, certification, integration with commerce\n            and with agro-industry in promoting joint action by\n            producers. 8) In a country where extensive agricultural and\n            livestock production are predominant, natural resources\n            management programs should address issues related to soil,\n            water, and pasture management in an integrated manner."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Natural Resources Management and\n            Irrigation Development

 adverse effects on natural ecosystems.

In the development\n            and operation and maintenance of the irrigation sub-sector,\n            a number of standard environmental issues have been\n            identified, such as: physical degradation of soil, water\n            contamination from agrochemicals under intensified\n            agriculure; wasteful use of water; deteriorating quality of\n            irrigation water; sedimentation of reservoirs; and damage to\n            biodiversity.
