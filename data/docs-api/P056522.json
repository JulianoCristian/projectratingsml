Lessons of experience drawn\n            from the project implementation follow. The program\n            structure of the project was appropriate, though the\n            leverage from financing was limited, explained through the\n            loan allocation to budget support - for institutional\n            reforms as mandated by the Constitution, and counterpart\n            assistance in policy reform - which emphasized flexibility,\n            and sustained momentum for the reform process. Indeed,\n            despite the Government's diminished financing needs as\n            economic recovery strengthened, budget support, not only\n            reinforced the management of the reform process, but allowed\n            progressive agencies to in turn, promote competition, and\n            reform. It is worth mentioning that, the intensive technical\n            assistance in designing the reform program, succeeded (in\n            part) because of the comprehensive, preparatory work of\n            diagnostic studies, financed by the Economic Management\n            Assistance Loan. However, the overly ambitious integration\n            of sectoral reform plans - in health, education, and\n            commerce - as originally designed, was hindered by the\n            magnitude for imminent institutional, procedural, and\n            cultural changes, which with proper incentives for\n            performance management, may effectively integrate into the\n            overall public sector reform, provided an enhanced\n            monitoring from the Government, and civil society."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Public Sector Reform Loan
