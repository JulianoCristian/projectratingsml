Some lessons learned\n            included: the World Bank should not remain indifferent to\n            the possibility of institutional frictions within the\n            government during the design and implementation of reforms.\n            A lot more effort needs to be put in for identifying the\n            potential pockets of resistance to these reforms, and\n            dialogue initiated with all parties to best manage that\n            resistance upfront. In future projects, significant\n            attention should be given to communication and change\n            management components. When multiple donors are interested\n            in project success, joint implementation arrangements should\n            exist from the beginning to increase momentum toward\n            effective implementation. Reliance on counterpart funds for\n            critical activities such as change management can affect the\n            implementation. Recognizing the importance of technical\n            support for the sustainability and success of a project as\n            such as second project to improve financial reporting and\n            auditing (PIFRA II), the government should create a career\n            path for technical staff and recognize them as an integral\n            part of civil service."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
