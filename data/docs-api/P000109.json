Key lessons from the implementation\n            of the project include: 1) All projects aiming at improving\n            processes must be based on an explicit consensus among\n            stakeholders and on a detailed assessment of their\n            respective capacities. 2) The supervision of a\n            multi-sectoral project is quite time-consuming on the\n            Bank's side, even if project management performance is\n            satisfactory. It requires a well-functioning country team,\n            budgetary cross-support, and effective coordination\n            arrangements for following-up studies execution and\n            conclusions dissemination. 3) The preparation of sectoral\n            strategies in sectors where the Government's role and\n            responsibilities are rapidly evolving requires first\n            building consensus and awareness among public stakeholders.\n            4) Genuinely-committed Borrowers may fully finance\n            incremental operating costs related to project management,\n            if the Bank does not assume a priori that this is the\n            Bank's responsibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -
