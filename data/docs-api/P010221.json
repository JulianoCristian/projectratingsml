Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, the tranche approach\n            used in this project was unworkable because it was\n            inconsistent with the Government's own project planning\n            and approval system. Also, a number of the prerequisites for\n            effective tranche programming simply were not present.\n            Second, the project introduced innovations and techniques\n            that were outside the norms and values of the organizations\n            administering the project.

Quality improvement would be achieved by more\n            effective in-service training and supervision of teachers,\n            improved learning materials, the expanded use of assistant\n            teachers, improved physical facilities, and greater\n            community support.  The success of the proposed project will\n            depend mainly on whether teachers can be influenced\n            sufficiently to improve the quality of teaching. The project\n            would adopt a new approach to teacher training through the\n            development of integrated learning modules for teacher\n            training and classroom use."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Primary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Primary\n            Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/03/741932/pakistan-second-primary-education-project","projn":"PK-Primary Education II -- P010221","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970625094629"},"subsc":"Primary education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement,achievements,addition,additional\n            funds,additional resources,adult literacy,age\n            group,agricultural education,basic education,basic\n            literacy,basic needs,classroom\n            teaching,composition,curriculum,developing\n            countries,Development Program,discoveries,economic\n            growth,education facilities,education programs,EDUCATION\n            SECTOR,education system,education targets,educational\n            administration,educational\n            opportunities,employment,engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            ratio,equal access,external support,families,girls,informal\n            education,innovation,instruction,instructional\n            materials,intermediaries,intervention,Learning,learning\n            materials,learning modules,literacy,literacy\n            program,literacy rate,low\n            achievement,Marketing,mathematics,migration,non-formal\n            education,numeracy,Open University,parity,policy\n            reform,population growth,potential benefits,Primary\n            Education,primary school,primary school enrollments,primary\n            schools,primary teachers,private sector,Psychology,public\n            sector,quality of education,reading,religious beliefs,rural\n            areas,rural children,school attendance,School\n            buildings,school facilities,school hours,schools,science\n            education,science kits,science teacher training,secondary\n            education,secondary level,skills training,social\n            services,social studies,syllabus,teacher,teacher\n            training,teacher training\n            programs,teachers,teaching,teaching skills,technical\n            education,training programs,university education,urban areas"},"1":{"cdata!":"achievement,achievements,addition,additional\n            funds,additional resources,adult literacy,age\n            group,agricultural education,basic education,basic\n            literacy,basic needs,classroom\n            teaching,composition,curriculum,developing\n            countries,Development Program,discoveries,economic\n            growth,education facilities,education programs,EDUCATION\n            SECTOR,education system,education targets,educational\n            administration,educational\n            opportunities,employment,engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            ratio,equal access,external support,families,girls,informal\n            education,innovation,instruction,instructional\n            materials,intermediaries,intervention,Learning,learning\n            materials,learning modules,literacy,literacy\n            program,literacy rate,low\n            achievement,Marketing,mathematics,migration,non-formal\n            education,numeracy,Open University,parity,policy\n            reform,population growth,potential benefits,Primary\n            Education,primary school,primary school enrollments,primary\n            schools,primary teachers,private sector,Psychology,public\n            sector,quality of education,reading,religious beliefs,rural\n            areas,rural children,school attendance,School\n            buildings,school facilities,school hours,schools,science\n            education,science kits,science teacher training,secondary\n            education,secondary level,skills training,social\n            services,social studies,syllabus,teacher,teacher\n            training,teacher training\n            programs,teachers,teaching,teaching skills,technical\n            education,training programs,university education,urban areas"}},"owner":"S.A.
