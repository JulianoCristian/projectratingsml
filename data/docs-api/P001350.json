The\n            projects did not achieve their main objectives,\n            institutional development was partially achieved,\n            sustainability is unlikely for the Financial Sector Project\n            and uncertain for the Financial Parastatals Project, and the\n            performance of the Bank was marginally satisfactory for the\n            Sector Project and satisfactory for the Parastatals Project\n            while the Borrower's was unsatisfactory for both\n            projects. Several lessons can be learned from these two\n            projects. First, it is important to have Government\n            commitment to the project. Also, there is a need to design\n            specific components, such that the interest in the project\n            is maintained. Second, there is a need to design projects\n            with a clear understanding of the political environment.\n            Third, when the implementation of a project is significantly\n            delayed, there should be some mechanism which forces a\n            special review process to check that the original design of\n            the project remains appropriate and has not been overtaken\n            by other events or projects. Finally, if a change in Task\n            Manager during implementation cannot be avoided, there\n            should be a mechanism to enforce an orderly transition."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Financial Technical Assistance Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya -
