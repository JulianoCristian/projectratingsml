Under the IBL, project\n            funded-equipment, training and advisory services resulted in\n            sustained improvements in performance in some of the\n            agencies. Bank performance during both preparation and\n            supervision was satisfactory, and illustrated that the\n            projects were designed as quick response, initial\n            relation-building projects. Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the Ministry of\n            Finance suggested that disbursements for future adjustment\n            loans be phased over time and linked to gradual progress in\n            meeting targets set up and agreed on. This will provide more\n            of a focus on economic reform as a process rather than an\n            event, and provide more discipline in the implementation.\n            Care should be taken to build consensus around the selection\n            and implementation of policy conditionality between the Bank\n            and the Government. The Government found that the long-term\n            consultancy assignments were often more useful than the\n            short-term ones. Short term assignments often did not allow\n            the consultant(s) to develop the appropriate understanding\n            of the Belarusian economy and often focused on too general\n            advice and concepts. The originally envisaged energy and\n            agriculture components of the Rehabilitation Loan did not\n            materialize, and the funds were transferred to the Foreign\n            Exchange component. Procurement of medicines was, therefore,\n            the only remaining component for which the Bank's\n            procurement rules applied. The Government feels that\n            earmarking of funds for particular imports in Rehab-type\n            projects should be carefully analyzed before the project\n            starts, although the educational benefits of doing\n            international procurement were significant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Belarus - Rehabilitation and Institution\n            Building Loan
