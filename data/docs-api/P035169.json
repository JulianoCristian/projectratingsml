The lessons learned indicate that programs\n            involving complex institutional change need assured long\n            term support or simpler design. The Project Appraisal\n            Document (PAD) rightly recognized that complex process\n            change was required to address state and national\n            development priorities in the sector, which needed time. A\n            well designed communication strategy in the project could\n            have vastly improved the impact of the participatory\n            management activities, avoided controversy over\n            modifications of rules for Van Panchayats and Joint Forest\n            Management (JFM). In view of the significance and importance\n            of Van Panchayats in the hills, the PAD rightly acknowledged\n            the need to strengthen these institutions as distinct from\n            JFM. However, the importance of this was not followed\n            through by including specific activities and clearly\n            adopting a separate approach from that of JFM in the\n            project. Monitoring, evaluation and management information\n            systems need to be consistent with technical capacity. The\n            Forest Management Information (FMIS) was overambitious given\n            the existing (low) level of technical expertise in the FD\n            and awareness amongst senior decision makers of its\n            benefits. A more appropriate approach could have included,\n            building computer and data management skills through\n            training initially, which would have underpinned more\n            meaningful interaction between users and developers of systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal\n            Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -
