initiated by the Government in 1985. This\n            first phase consists of a comprehensive set of policies and\n            reforms aimed at (i) elimination of exchange rate and\n            pricing distortions and (ii) retrenchment of the public\n            sector in order to bring it into balance with the productive\n            capacity of the economy. Specifically, the ERP program\n            includes several measures. They are (i) exchange rate and\n            pricing policy; (ii) agricultural pricing policy and\n            institutional reforms; (iii) incentives for other productive\n            sectors; (iv) far-reaching reforms of public administration;\n            and (v) public enterprise reform. They also involve (vi)\n            reorientation of the public investment program; (vii)\n            financial sector reforms; and (viii) sustained pursuit of\n            prudent fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies. An\n            economic adviser to the Presidency, currently being\n            recruited under the special technical assistance program for\n            IDA-only countries, would work closely with
