Lessons are suggested as follows. It\n            is important that the Government, the Implementing Agency\n            and the Bank share a common vision about the strategic\n            direction of the power sector. This vision was not\n            completely agreed upon at the outset, resulting in problems\n            down the road. On a related issue, it is clear that Ethiopia\n            is blessed with a low-cost, competitive hydro potential\n            which can be harnessed to benefit the country, and the\n            region as a whole. However, the scale of those projects\n            represents a substantial financial commitment, and entails\n            several types of risks (e.g. geological, market) for the\n            incumbent utility, which may end up weakening the overall\n            sustainability of the power sector. Therefore, the current\n            business model of having solely the local utility as the\n            implementing agency may not provide the necessary hydro\n            capacity to meet Ethiopia and regional needs. A second\n            lesson indicates that continuity in task supervision is a\n            very important factor in assuring a good project\n            performance. In line with this, timely completion of a\n            Mid-Term-Review could have helped facilitate the transition,\n            highlighting problematic areas and issues that needed urgent\n            management attention, both to the task team and to the\n            implementing agencies. In addition, Project Appraisal\n            Documents (PADs) should be designed to allow a more complete\n            discussion of the risk of the impact of unforeseen events,\n            which can delay project implementation, and result in cost\n            overruns that adversely affect anticipated economic and\n            financial results. Finally, the potential for introducing\n            agricultural residue-based charcoal to supplement or\n            displace the wood charcoal, presently supplied and consumed\n            in urban areas is significant, but such investment would be\n            financially viable only at large-scale operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -

These are\n            identified on the basis of their intensity, area covered\n            and/or size of human population affected as: 1) Dislocation\n            of people -those who reside within the reservoir area and\n            those who live outside of the area to be flooded and who\n            rely on lands within and outside of the reservoir area- is\n            mitigated by a comprehensive resettlement plan. 2)\n            Intensification of diseases linked to water -malaria,\n            onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis- and of sexually\n            transmitted diseases, is mitigated by building a buffer\n            around and deepening the margins of the reservoir; and\n            providing health education; preventing shanty town\n            development near construction camps; providing separate\n            dwellings within the camp for men and women; and\n            distributing free condoms. 3) Loss of food production due to\n            the permanent loss of agricultural lands may be alleviated\n            by more intensive agriculture and improved livestock\n            management, and bringing fallow land into production. 4)\n            Loss of biodiversity, specifically, the loss of riverine\n            forest and water flows, which fauna and flora rely on as\n            their habitat, generally cannot be mitigated. However,\n            forest can be established elsewhere to replace total biomass\n            loss, and the reservoir will develop its own ecological\n            system over time. Recommended is formal protection of the\n            forested valley between the dam and the tailrace to ensure\n            that this area's riverine forest is protected. 5) The\n            loss of downstream aquatic habitat can be partially\n            mitigated by providing a compensation flow, a consideration\n            to be weighed against lost hydropower. Other potential and\n            less disruptive impacts are envisioned as humidity rise,\n            change in water quality in the reservoir and downstream,\n            shoreline dumping, reservoir sedimentation and flushing, and\n            eutrophication. Recommendations for alleviation include:\n            water management through a release program, containing\n            pollutants, stabilizing the shoreline with suitable\n            vegetative species, reducing soil erosion with watershed\n            management, and removing large plants before the reservoir\n            is filled to prevent nutrient overload."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia

five negative environmental\n            impacts likely to result from preparing, constructing, and\n            operating the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Project. These are\n            identified on the basis of their intensity, area covered\n            and/or size of human population affected as: 1) Dislocation\n            of people -those who reside within the reservoir area and\n            those who live outside of the area to be flooded and who\n            rely on lands within and outside of the reservoir area- is\n            mitigated by a comprehensive resettlement plan. 2)\n            Intensification of diseases linked to water -malaria,\n            onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis- and of sexually\n            transmitted diseases, is mitigated by building a buffer\n            around and deepening the margins of the reservoir; and\n            providing health education; preventing shanty town\n            development near construction camps; providing separate\n            dwellings within the camp for men and women; and\n            distributing free condoms. 3) Loss of food production due to\n            the permanent loss of agricultural lands may be alleviated\n            by more intensive agriculture and improved livestock\n            management, and bringing fallow land into production. 4)\n            Loss of biodiversity, specifically, the loss of riverine\n            forest and water flows, which fauna and flora rely on as\n            their habitat, generally cannot be mitigated. However,\n            forest can be established elsewhere to replace total biomass\n            loss, and the reservoir will develop its own ecological\n            system over time. Recommended is formal protection of the\n            forested valley between the dam and the tailrace to ensure\n            that this area's riverine forest is protected. 5) The\n            loss of downstream aquatic habitat can be partially\n            mitigated by providing a compensation flow, a consideration\n            to be weighed against lost hydropower. Other potential and\n            less disruptive impacts are envisioned as humidity rise,\n            change in water quality in the reservoir and downstream,\n            shoreline dumping, reservoir sedimentation and flushing, and\n            eutrophication. Recommendations for alleviation include:\n            water management through a release program, containing\n            pollutants, stabilizing the shoreline with suitable\n            vegetative species, reducing soil erosion with watershed\n            management, and removing large plants before the reservoir\n            is filled to prevent nutrient overload."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia
