Some lessons learned included:\n            hands on capacity building for systems and process\n            improvements, with continuous post implementation follow-up\n            and support, can bring about sustainable institutional\n            development. Development of service delivery indicators by\n            tehsil municipal administration (TMA) officials led to\n            regular data acquisition and transmission from TMAs to\n            Punjab Municipal Development Fund Company (PMDFC) to local\n            government (LG) department. Good procurement and contract\n            management practices in TMAs and implementing agency (IAs)\n            over time facilitated robust competition and efficient\n            contract completion. Community support increases manifold\n            when resettlement was accompanied by wider social\n            mobilization and benefit-sharing efforts. Creating a culture\n            of performance management is time and effort intensive.\n            Institutions take strong ownership of institutional\n            development activities if interventions are aligned to their\n            mandates and assist in responding to them.
