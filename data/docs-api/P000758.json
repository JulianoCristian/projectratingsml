The key lessons learned from\n            this project include: 1) This project has three major\n            components, which were carried out by different\n            institutions. Each organization was responsible for a\n            specific component of the project. The overall coordination\n            of this project was found difficult and showed a delay in\n            some of the activities. Hence, following a decentralized\n            approach along institutional specialization in implementing\n            such a project can minimize the risk of complexity and\n            improve implementation. 2) Bank should have been flexible\n            and ready to review the impact of the privatization issue.\n            3) The studies conducted came up with important conclusions\n            and recommendations which are of importance in solving\n            problems connected with the respective fields of study. 4)\n            The involvement of local experts in the implementation of\n            some studies carried out by international consultants helped\n            them gain experience in their respective fields. 5) The\n            training and procurement of goods and machinery enhanced the\n            capacity of organizations involved in the project to\n            implement their respective activities in an enhanced manner."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Calub Energy Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Calub Energy\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1551954/ethiopia-calub-energy-development-project","projn":"ET-Calub Energy Dev.

Ethiopia by\n            increasing the availability of modern fuels; (ii) support\n            economic growth by expanding petroleum supply from\n            indigenous resources; (iii) contribute to the mitigation of\n            peri-urban deforestation by inducing the replacement of\n            woodfuels with Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and kerosene in\n            urban households; (iv) develop the country's technical\n            capacity to commercialize its fossil fuel resources; and (v)\n            contribute to poverty alleviation through direct measures,\n            induced economic activity and through the development of\n            Ethiopia's remote south-eastern region. The project\n            will also stimulate and facilitate private sector\n            participation in the energy sector and enhance Ministry of\n            Mines and Energy's (MME's) ability to promote\n            petroleum exploration and development. The project has a\n            significant \"pilot\" dimension and may be viewed as\n            the starting point for a comprehensive, long-term\n            development of the country's fossil-fuel resources. In\n            order for the project to operate in an enabling regulatory\n            environment, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia will\n            implement and maintain a revised LPG pricing policy based on\n            import parity, study ways to optimize current pricing policy\n            for all petroleum products, and establish national LPG standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Calub Gas Development Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Calub Gas Development\n            Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/03/442321/ethiopia-calub-gas-development-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"ET-Calub Energy Dev.
