The first component - support to the\n            public sector response - will help ministries and related\n            public institutions initiate and/or expand the response to\n            HIVIAIDS, by supporting ministries' preparedness, and\n            implementation of sectoral plans that address the challenge\n            of HIV/AIDS with an emphasis on prevention and care. The\n            component will finance, and assist in the preparation of the\n            ministries' action plans for HIVIAIDS control; and\n            capacity building within the Government to manage the fight\n            against HIV/AIDS in a sustainable manner. The second\n            component will leverage the capacity of the private sector,\n            and accelerate the effectiveness of the Government's\n            efforts fighting HIV/AIDS, mobilizing the private sector\n            through the creation of a business coalition against\n            HIV/AIDS, targeting small and medium enterprises (SMEs),\n            emphasizing participation by the informal sector through\n            pilot, and demonstrative initiatives. The objective of the\n            third component is to develop initiatives to combat HIVIAIDS\n            by civil society organizations (CSOs), including community\n            based organizations (CBOs), faith based organizations\n            (FBOs), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), women and\n            youth groups, associations of people living with AIDS, and\n            other grass roots associations. Capacity building will be\n            reinforced to identify, prepare and implement action plans,\n            and sub-projects. The last component will provide technical\n            support services, equipment and materials, to develop a\n            comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system, including\n            financial and technical aspects, to support epidemiological\n            surveillance, operational research and surveys. A\n            demographic and health survey, and a bio-annual behavioral\n            surveillance survey will be implemented to monitor changes\n            supported by training, and supervision. Certification of\n            laboratories, voluntary counseling and testing, of treatment\n            centers, and pharmacies providing antiretroviral drugs\n            (ARVs) will be

national\n            plan for managing biomedical waste anticipates negative\n            environmental impacts resulting from the plan's\n            implementation and proposes measures to mitigate them. Some\n            risks posed by the planned waste collection, treatment, and\n            disposal include the following: Prevent water contamination,\n            accidental pricking from sharps, and the infestation of\n            disease-carrying insects by ensuring groundwater and surface\n            water resources are kept separate from polluting sources,\n            ensuring that the disposal site will not be used neither be\n            used for either agricultural or residential purposes, and\n            lining the site with a closed, impermeable layer. To avoid\n            infection from recovering patients; the risk of the reuse\n            and sale of contaminated syringes; the increase in the\n            incidence of diseases like tetanus, typhoid, diarrhea,\n            hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS; and the outbreak of respiratory\n            ailments and other infections among the general population\n            because of transporting untreated solid waste matter to dump\n            sites by cart or uncovered trucks, sort and segregate sharp\n            waste at the source, use different containers from those\n            used for household garbage, treat waste as appropriate,\n            transport waste in covered vehicles identified by signage\n            and traveling at restricted speeds. If disposal is by\n            incineration there is a risk to nearby residential areas of\n            air pollution from dioxins, heavy metals, and other\n            combustible materials, and to personnel involved in waste\n            disposal by incineration. To mitigate these risks, manage\n            waste storage, set up a system to filter the smoke emitted;\n            increase the height of the ventilation shaft/flume to permit\n            the release of residual pollutants; monitor plastic\n            material, glass and metal and other such materials, and\n            contents under pressure to prevent the incinerator from\n            dysfunction and toxic emissions or explosions; and direct\n            personnel to wear protective clothing and gear. To minimize\n            risks from burning waste in the open air such as the\n            dispersion of highly resistant microorganisms as well as the\n            increased incidence of respiratory infections and other\n            infections connected with hospitals, the proliferation of\n            disease carrying insects and rodents, and the diffusion of\n            smoke containing noncombustible pollutants, obtain and\n            manage adaptable elimination systems and treat the waste\n            before burning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Projet multisectoriel de lutte contre le\n            VIH/SIDA : Plan national de gestion des dechets biomedicaux"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali \u2013 Projet multisectoriel de\n            lutte contre le VIH/SIDA : \u00e9valuation environnementale :\n            Projet multisectoriel de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA\u00a0: Plan\n            national de gestion des d\u00e9chets biom\u00e9dicaux"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/04/4421821/mali-multi-sectoral-hivaids-project-environmental-assessment-projet-multisectoriel-de-lutte-contre-le-vihsida-plan-national-de-gestion-des-dechets-biomedicaux","projn":"ML-Mali - Multi-Sectoral Hiv/Aids Project -- P082957","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Mali","authors":{"authr":"Doucoure, Djibril"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040622173909"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Waste management;
