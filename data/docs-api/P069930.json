The project objective\n            remained unchanged during implementation. However, following\n            the decision of the European Union to finance the long-term\n            rehabilitation of the South Corridor (rather than the\n            initially planned North Corridor), a supplemental credit was\n            approved by IDA in May 2003 to enable more extensive and\n            sustainable rehabilitation and maintenance works on the road\n            between Djibouti and Galafi. Principal performance rating\n            are as follows ; outcome was satisfactory; sustainability\n            was likely; institutional development impact was modest;\n            Bank and borrower performance was satisfactory. The report\n            cites the following as lessons learned: 1) need of simple\n            design in emergency operation. 2) In emergency operations,\n            substantial training activities and intensive supervision\n            efforts are required to build capacity and support for PIUs\n            during initial stages of the project. 3) Difficulty in\n            achieving institutional reforms in emergency operations. 4)\n            The experience of this project confirms that in addition to\n            general delays in project execution, the construction and\n            supervision cost of force accounts are likely to be much\n            higher that those of the private contractors. Finally, the\n            project shows the importance of flexibility and timely\n            responsiveness to changes in circumstances and client's\n            needs. During implementation the Bank reacted well and took\n            all actions necessary to secure achievement of the project\n            objective despite the changed situation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti -

Phase I would have the following\n            components: 1) civil works between Dikhil and Galafi, 2)\n            civil works between Arta and Dikhil, and 3) rehabilitation\n            of Roads Department's equipment pool. Phase II will\n            have the following components: 4) routine maintenance of the\n            entire Arta-spur to Galafi; 5) axle load control station; 6)\n            project implementation

Further measures include adequate waste\n            disposal, and adoption of health, and safety controls; 3)\n            final designs for the road rehabilitation program will take\n            into account storm water, and sediment management\n            requirements for crossings, and culverts; 4) field\n            investigations on archaeological sites will be conducted, to\n            protect these, and burial sites from earth works; and, 5)\n            support for HIV/AIDS education, and outreach programs is\n            included in the plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti -
