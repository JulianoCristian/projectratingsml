The project did\n            not fully achieve its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was modest, sustainability is\n            likely, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, it is important during appraisal to take the\n            time necessary to ensure that institutional arrangements are\n            adequate to implement the project. Second, accurate\n            estimates of civil works costs require thorough inspections\n            and condition surveys during identification and appraisal.\n            Third, consultant engineers and economists preparing project\n            designs and costs cannot be relied upon to deliver\n            appropriate and accurate products without a thorough review\n            by the Bank and Borrower. Fourth, when the implementing\n            agency is inexperienced in dealing with international\n            contractors and large contracts, the supervisory role for\n            the Bank substantially increases. Fifth, the use of\n            standardized bidding documents should be mandated to limit\n            bidding problems and contractor claims. Finally, technology\n            transfers work best when counterpart staff are expressly\n            assigned to the project from its inception and continuity is assured."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Second Roads Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Second Roads Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/06/734169/sri-lanka-second-roads-project","projn":"LK-Second Roads Project -- P010215","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Municipal Housing and Land,Business Environment,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007000411"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accountants,accounting,accounts,actual\n            costs,Asphaltic Concrete,audit reports,Bank examination,Bank\n            performance,Bank records,Bank\n            supervision,Bidding,bitumen,bridge,bridges,compaction,construction,construction\n            contracts,construction management,Cost of Capital,cost\n            overruns,Daily\n            Traffic,drainage,emulsion,expenditure,fares,FISCAL\n            YEAR,headway,highway engineering,highway maintenance,highway\n            planning,Highways,Internal Rate of Return,land\n            acquisition,local contractors,local governments,National\n            Roads,net benefits,net present value,overlay,passenger,paved\n            roads,periodic maintenance,procurement,quality\n            control,railways,Rate of Return,Reorganization,road\n            construction,road maintenance,Road transport,Roads,routine\n            maintenance,safety,savings,speed,structures,Surface\n            Treatment,technical\n            assistance,topography,Transport,transport planning,transport\n            statistics,Transportation,travel time,Urban\n            Transport,vehicle operating costs,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accountants,accounting,accounts,actual\n            costs,Asphaltic Concrete,audit reports,Bank examination,Bank\n            performance,Bank records,Bank\n            supervision,Bidding,bitumen,bridge,bridges,compaction,construction,construction\n            contracts,construction management,Cost of Capital,cost\n            overruns,Daily\n            Traffic,drainage,emulsion,expenditure,fares,FISCAL\n            YEAR,headway,highway engineering,highway maintenance,highway\n            planning,Highways,Internal Rate of Return,land\n            acquisition,local contractors,local governments,National\n            Roads,net benefits,net present value,overlay,passenger,paved\n            roads,periodic maintenance,procurement,quality\n            control,railways,Rate of Return,Reorganization,road\n            construction,road maintenance,Road transport,Roads,routine\n            maintenance,safety,savings,speed,structures,Surface\n            Treatment,technical\n            assistance,topography,Transport,transport planning,transport\n            statistics,Transportation,travel time,Urban\n            Transport,vehicle operating costs,vehicles"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"13276"},"740083":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/03/740083/sri-lanka-second-roads-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/03/740083/sri-lanka-second-roads-project","new_url":"1985/03/740083/sri-lanka-second-roads-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/03/01/000009265_3970702140041/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/03/01/000009265_3970702140041/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2517","docdt":"1985-03-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Second Roads Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Roads Project seeks to\n            improve periodic maintenance of the trunk road network,\n            including bridges, and to strengthen the institutions\n            concerned with transport infrastructure.
