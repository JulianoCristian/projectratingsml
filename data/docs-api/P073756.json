The two loans by the Bank\n            supporting the bank restructuring and debt management\n            program (BRDP) present an interesting, though complex, set\n            of lessons: these lessons span the spectrum from the\n            positive - where client commitment, choice of appropriate\n            lending instrument, and close collaboration among the\n            international financial institutions (IFIs), led to positive\n            outcomes - to the more circumspect, that often Bank\n            operations face, with country risks that are easier to\n            identify than to mitigate within the context of sector\n            adjustment loans. 1) Importance of client commitment to\n            reform: The excellent Government's cooperation with the\n            Bank allowed the genuine commitment of the Bank team to work\n            in identifying feasible policy options for dealing with the\n            aftermath of the financial crisis. This joint effort led to\n            a satisfactory implementation experience, despite major\n            risks, in particular given that the cost of not supporting\n            the Government's reform efforts, was deemed\n            unacceptably high. 2) Importance of selecting an appropriate\n            lending instrument: experience clearly vindicated the choice\n            of two single-tranche programmatic loans, over a more\n            traditional single-loan two-tranche approach, an approach\n            that also provided the Bank with leverage to work with the\n            Government, reaching satisfactory resolutions of some\n            outstanding issues from the first loan. This choice also\n            enabled lessons from past Bank experience with Jamaica: the\n            Bank reduced the risk of delay, and failure in the\n            achievement of the program's medium term aims, by\n            avoiding locking the client early on into an overly\n            ambitious, politically sensitive, and risky agenda with\n            excessive conditionality. 3) Importance of close\n            collaboration with other IFIs and with the country staff:\n            especially in the dysfunctional phasing of the reforms\n            programs, where risks were clearly high, the Bank gained\n            from the sectoral perspectives of the Inter-American\n            Development Bank, and the macro views of the International\n            Monetary Fund, while in turn both these institutions\n            benefited from the Bank's knowledge in restructuring of\n            banking sectors, as well as its often more conservative\n            views on evolution of macroeconomic variables. Further\n            lessons address issues on designing adjustment programs,\n            and, on the major risks facing the sustainability of reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Second Bank
