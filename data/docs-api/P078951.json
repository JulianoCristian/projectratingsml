Nevertheless, the project\n            proved itself a very effective instrument for maintaining a\n            constructive dialogue, and pressure to move forward on a\n            coherent and focused policy agenda. Moreover, by bringing\n            the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) into a central\n            role in the negotiation of the social agenda, and\n            responsibility for its implementation, the Program also\n            effectively engaged the influence, and commitment of the\n            state budget to push the reforms forward, and to provide the\n            necessary resources. Social reforms are inevitably\n            experimental, and strong monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            systems are essential in drawing the lessons of pilot\n            efforts, to refining instruments, and in guiding the\n            adjustment of policies and programs over time. While M&E\n            development was supported from the beginning of the program,\n            many delays in design and implementation of monitoring\n            tools, limited the possibility to assess the evolution of\n            programs. Finally, in the face of strong political pressures\n            to transfer resources to regional government programs and to\n            raise salaries, the inclusion of the Program conditionality\n            may have succeeded in preventing some erosion of the funding\n            available for the selected programs, as well as in\n            encouraging their closer monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -
