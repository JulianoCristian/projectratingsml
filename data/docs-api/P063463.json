Field measurements and\n            conservative mathematical model to estimate the gas amount\n            will help in that regard; 4) A continuous dissemination and\n            capacity building program is essential to sustain municipal\n            buy in; 5) The involvement of the private sector has been\n            very effective and proven feasible in a mainly public sector\n            domain. In the context of changing governments, the private\n            sector involvement helped ensure that the plant management\n            would be consistent and uninterrupted; 6) High energy prices\n            benefit LFG to power projects in Mexico and future energy\n            price scenarios should be taken into account while assessing\n            the feasibility of LFG to power projects; and 7) In future\n            many uncertainties while planning and setting up a LFG\n            facility can be overcome with the perspective of a long-term\n            and reliable revenue generated from emission reductions. The\n            availability of emission reductions revenues provides an\n            investor with more certainty on his investment and also\n            bears the possibility of addressing social and environmental\n            programs with part of the revenues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

Similarly, oil spills will\n            be stored, to be transported to pre-selected sites for final\n            disposal. 3) A methane detector will be installed to prevent\n            flammable gas concentrations, and potential fire hazards. 4)\n            Wall barriers will be installed, and protective equipment\n            available to mitigate noise disturbances.
