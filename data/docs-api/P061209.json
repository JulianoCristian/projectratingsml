Some lessons learned included: provision of\n            school places is not enough to promote access. Targeted\n            interventions are sometimes needed to address specific\n            constraints of some groups. The use of ERAs (Ecole Rurale\n            Alternative - Alternative Rural Schools) and the tutoring\n            programs for girls was used effectively in this project.\n            Demand side issues also need to be addressed to complement\n            provision of school places. Community involvement in the\n            management of schools is a key factor for success as\n            demonstrated by the activities of the COGES (Comite de\n            Gestion des Etablissements Scolaires - School Management\n            Committee). Reforms aimed at reducing the period of teacher\n            training on the assumption that teachers already have basic\n            knowledge of subject contents should first be verified\n            before implementation. This will help avoid inadequate\n            training and the reversal of this policy as happened in\n            Niger. When models based on adaptations of local technology\n            that could be sensitive are proposed, such as the steel\n            framed construction of schools, these models should be fully\n            discussed and agreed with all stakeholders, including the\n            wider public, before they are implemented to avoid\n            unexpected reversals of policy. Decentralization of\n            education management especially to local/school levels\n            should be accompanied by a clearly worked out fiduciary\n            management system that will ensure proper use and\n            accountability of funds to minimize the risk of leakage and\n            suspension of the reform. During preparation and appraisal\n            every effort should be made to adopt uniform arrangements\n            for implementation. If this could not be done then the risks\n            associated with the use of different procedures should be\n            assessed and included in the appraisal/ approval process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Basic Education
