Lessons convey the following. By\n            and large, within Africa, a Road Fund, financed from user\n            fees is an important way to ensure the availability of funds\n            for maintenance. In this case, even when the government\n            lacked budgetary resources, the Road Fund continued to be\n            funded. However, mobilizing local counterpart funding in\n            rural areas for road maintenance is difficult, where the\n            overhead costs for community mobilization (fees to NGOs) are\n            high and are likely to make replicability difficult.\n            Therefore, additional means of financing rural road\n            maintenance should be considered. Moreover, when a Road Fund\n            is introduced, the responsibility of each agency should be\n            clearly outlined in order to avoid potential disagreements.\n            Whereas the Road Fund did provide funds for civil works,\n            conflicts arose concerning how the funds should be managed,\n            and which agency should contract the work.  In addition,\n            small and medium contractors (PMEs) encountered difficulties\n            in the development of the new maintenance system; instead,\n            it would have been useful to develop a system of assistance\n            for PMEs during preparation. It is recommended to accompany\n            the privatization of road maintenance activities, with\n            widespread training programs, to quickly build up the\n            necessary capacity in the construction industry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Road Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Road Transport

rehabilitating the main roads and rural\n            highway network, and setting the bases for its long-term\n            maintenance. Mild environmental impacts are expected because\n            no new roads will be opened up. Also, the project encourages\n            labor intensive road maintenance activities that are more\n            environmentally friendly. Field observations revealed that\n            the project will have minor negative environmental impacts\n            that can be mitigated. Dirt roads only require mild\n            rehabilitation by resurfacing and eliminating critical\n            points. Certain tracks of the tarred roads will require\n            heavy rehabilitation in the short term. The needs of the\n            rural population will be considered when selecting rural\n            roads to be rehabilitated. Other minimizing measures in\n            rural areas include: (1) technically restoring laterite\n            quarries by leveling the grounds and spreading back organic\n            soil on the area, and restoring vegetative cover through\n            tree planting or grass propagation, or transforming these\n            quarries into water reservoirs; (2) improving drainage\n            infrastructure to restore original water transfers naturally\n            regulating the wetlands; (3) improving the downstream\n            portion of road drainage systems to prevent accelerated\n            formation of gullies and erosion alongside and the roads;\n            (4) Controlling dust, which can cause health hazards and\n            mild damage to crops and vegetation, by frequent watering of\n            construction sites, already widely practiced. In urban\n            areas, mitigations include: (1) reconstructing and\n            maintaining the drainage system, and paving instead of\n            tarring roads to prevent urban flooding; and (2) installing\n            vehicle pollution standards and an inspection system to\n            reduce emissions. Habitat destruction and relocation of\n            either rural residents or urban dwellers will generally be\n            avoided, while recommendations for instituting a better\n            compensation system are incorporated in this study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republique Togolaise - Programme sectoriel\n            d'investissement routier : etude d'impact environnemental"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"R\u00e9publique togolaise \u2013 Programme\n            sectoriel d\u2019investissement routier : \u00e9tude d\u2019impact environnemental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/02/441309/republique-togolaise-programme-sectoriel-dinvestissement-routier-etude-dimpact-environnemental","projn":"TG-Road Transport Project -- P002875","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Togo","authors":{"authr":"Nicolas EGLI"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980429110115"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-1","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting systems;
