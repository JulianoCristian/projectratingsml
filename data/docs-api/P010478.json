For the NWFP Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project, project outcome is moderately\n            satisfactory; sustainability is likely; institutional\n            development impact is modest; overall Bank performance is\n            satisfactory; and overall Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. For the NFWP Community Infrastructure Project,\n            project outcome is moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability\n            is unlikely; institutional development impact is modest;\n            overall Bank performance is unsatisfactory; and overall\n            Borrower performance is unsatisfactory. The main lessons\n            from these projects are: 1) Operations at the sub-national\n            level are a useful complement to those at the national\n            level. In terms of contributing to improved delivery of\n            service and poverty reduction, they compare favorably with\n            the Social Action Program. 2) Unless the mechanisms\n            governing the financial relationships between the federal\n            and provincial governments are revised, there is little or\n            no prospect for the provinces to be able to fulfill their\n            social mandate as provided by the Constitution and the\n            devolution plan in a sustainable manner. 3) Capacity at the\n            lower level is generally very weak since power resides at\n            the center for historical reasons. The focus, content, and\n            design of sub-national operations should target capacity and\n            institutional building at that level in conjunction with the\n            transfer of responsibilities from the higher to the lower\n            level. 4) When designing sub-national operations, joint\n            discussions with the central government are indispensable\n            for success. 5) Ownership and commitment, at the political\n            as well as at the administrative level, are keys to success.\n            6) Given the weak local capacity, emphasis should be placed\n            not only on building institutional capacity and training,\n            but also on incentives to encourage staff to learn and\n            assume greater responsibility. 7) Sub-national operations\n            should be accompanied by well designed and well focused\n            technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

The main lessons learned\n            are: The decentralized, participation-based approach to\n            provision of infrastructures has proven to be successful and\n            is replicable. For replication to happen, considerable\n            institutional capacity in the provincial government, and\n            lower level of governments are required to implement a large\n            decentralized program of this type. Community development\n            and empowerment is an essential prerequisite for project\n            investments in local communities and became the basis for\n            the new decentralization policies of the Government. It is\n            clear that the project's model can support the\n            devolution process, but this would need considerable effort\n            to build up the capability of the weak and newly devolved\n            local governments in partnership with their\n            communities--with the help of other partners, service\n            organizations such as the nongovernmental organizations, the\n            private sector, established government, and private training\n            institutions. The report contains other lessons highlighted\n            from the experience of the project:  Development of adequate\n            human and institutional capacity is essential at all levels\n            and this was initially a problem in the project. Strong\n            commitment should be ensured from the Government and\n            implementation agencies in terms of minimizing the\n            bureaucratic delays (speedy approval), presence of project\n            staff for the project duration, and flexibility toward the\n            socially oriented development. Innovative, community-based\n            projects must respond flexibly and adapt to the varying\n            demands generated during the community mobilization process.\n            Sufficient time needs to be allowed for awareness building\n            and community development before planning investments.\n            Ensure that procurement capacity of the implementing agency\n            is properly assessed during project preparation, take steps\n            in the project design to strengthen it and that Bank\n            procurement guidelines are fully understood by the Borrower.\n            Ensure inclusion of a sound financial management system in\n            the project design. Post implementation monitoring needs to\n            be sustained which could help in resource allocation for the\n            maintenance of physical and social infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - NWFP Community Infrastructure and\n            National Housing Authority (NHA) Strengthening Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -
