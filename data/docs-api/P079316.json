Some lessons\n            learned included: the cross-sectoral nature of development\n            policy lending remains adequate for a country still facing\n            broad reform challenges. The cross-sectoral design has the\n            advantage of: (i) reflecting the broad nature of\n            Ukraine's reform challenges and the correspondingly\n            broad ranging government reform programs, (ii) allowing for\n            support to be adapted flexibly to changing political\n            priorities within this broad agenda, and (iii) providing an\n            instrument from inter-agency coordination on the side of the\n            authorities and inter-sectoral coordination on the side of\n            the Bank. Monitoring and evaluation indicators should be\n            well defined in terms of availability of data and relatively\n            easy methodology, clear for both sides. In some cases,\n            especially in the areas of trade diversification, corporate\n            governance and parts of the energy sector, the suggested\n            indicators turned out to be too complex for the borrower to\n            calculate them. In some cases the methodology, which the\n            borrower used, was not clear to the Bank. As a result, the\n            calculated indicator was meaningless, and monitoring\n            hampered. Future operations should aim to have a more\n            limited number of outcome targets, drawing on publicly\n            available information and mutually understood methodologies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - First Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine - First Development\n            Policy Loan

support priority reforms in the social and\n            economic spheres of the program of the Government of Ukraine\n            - \"Action Plan for Meeting the People\". The\n            project design focuses on the institutional and policy\n            changes necessary to implement the reforms, within the\n            context of Ukraine's European Union (EU) integration\n            efforts, and, is a valuable tool in the process of\n            implementing the Ukraine-EU Action Plan. The DPL program,\n            supported by the project, seeks to integrate government, and\n            donor activities under three broad themes to improve public\n            governance: a) investment climate, b) public administration\n            and public finance management, and, c) social inclusion. It\n            builds on a number of accomplishments supported under the\n            Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL-2), being concluded\n            in parallel with this loan. However, there are political and\n            economic risks, which the DPL's design will seek to\n            mitigate. Engagement will improve the Bank's capacity\n            to help the authorities make appropriate policy decisions.\n            Furthermore, the content of the program creates the basis\n            for sustained, and diversified growth over the medium term.\n            More broadly-based and socially inclusive growth should help\n            dampen the political costs of reform, while reducing
