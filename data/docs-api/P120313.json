Some lessons learned included:\n            the role of loans in addressing climate change became a\n            communication challenge for this operation. The role of\n            policy loans in development finance was a communication\n            challenge with the line ministries responsible for\n            delivering results. Wider and more regular communication\n            about these sorts of issues would help to clarify\n            expectations and intentions, strengthening the partnership.\n            More involvement in monitoring and tracking of indicators at\n            activity level could have sent a stronger signal to\n            technical ministries, provided greater opportunity to steer\n            the policy process, and provided feedback to senior\n            management. The project process brought together policy\n            makers, policy implementers, development partners and other\n            stakeholders in a dialogue process. This was relatively\n            unique at the time for the breadth of issues covered and the\n            number of agencies convened. However, the number of agencies\n            and actions covered also created challenges for\n            communicating clearly about the rationale for the operation,\n            the use of the funds, and the links to the specific policy\n            actions.

Policy\n            Loan (CC DPL) Program to Indonesia for US$ 200 million will\n            support the Government's policy agenda on climate\n            change, an issue of growing global concern. The CC DPL is\n            envisioned as a series of four annual single tranche loans\n            of similar size anchored to the FY09-FY12 Country\n            Partnership Strategy (CPS). CC DPL provides support in three\n            core areas: (i) addressing the need to mitigate\n            Indonesia's greenhouse gas emissions; (ii) enhancing\n            adaptation and resiliency efforts in key sectors; and (iii)\n            strengthening the institutions and cross-cutting policy\n            framework needed for a successful climate change response.\n            Indonesia is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts -\n            sea level rise, changing weather patterns, and increased\n            uncertainty. Potential impacts include: increased threats to\n            food security and agricultural productivity; impacts on\n            productive coastal zones and community livelihoods;\n            consequences for water storage; intensification of water-\n            and vector-borne diseases; and deterioration of coral\n            ecosystems. These changes will put past development gains\n            and poverty alleviation efforts at risk. An approach that\n            increases adaptive ability, builds community resilience and\n            increases preparedness for managing disasters makes economic\n            sense for Indonesia, a kind of insurance. Indonesia may also\n            be able to tap into new forms of global financing to assist\n            in this adaptation response."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Climate Change Development\n
