Lessons learned from the project: As is\n            fitting for a project supporting acquisition of knowledge,\n            many of the lessons learned are technical in nature.\n            Interlinked national projects are vulnerable to failure of\n            one of the partners, and must build in peer review and\n            assistance, and safeguards in the event that these fail.\n            Scientific research must be targeted, provide usable\n            information for management decisions and be widely\n            accessible. Regional projects necessitate greater emphasis\n            on clarity of project objectives, monitorable frameworks, at\n            multiple levels, and adequate mechanisms for governance. The\n            Basin perspective is critical to address the key\n            environmental issues of Lake Victoria. Capacity building has\n            to address both current and projected gaps. Implementation\n            in the future can be undertaken through governmental\n            structures. Environmental benefits must be strongly linked\n            to improved livelihoods for local people and communities.\n            Good education of the public and parliamentarians is\n            critical for long term sustainability and success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Lake Victoria Environmental\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Lake Victoria\n            Environmental Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6940276/tanzania-lake-victoria-environmental-management-project","projn":"TZ-Lake Victoria Environment (Ida) -- P046837","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Ecosystems and Natural Habitats,Wetlands,Water Conservation,Water and Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Water Resources,Environment","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060721110707"},"subsc":"Animal production,Tertiary education,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Education,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, allocation of resources,\n            aquaculture, aquatic weeds, areas of biodiversity,\n            atmospheric deposition, Basin, Basin Commission, Beach,\n            Biodiversity, Biodiversity Conservation, biological control,\n            biology, BOD, Brooks, Buffering Capacity, Catch per Unit\n            Effort, Constructed wetlands, construction, cost\n            effectiveness, data collection, direct pollution, economic\n            growth, economic impact, ecosystem, ecosystem management,\n            Effluent, Effluent Treatment, Effluents, ENVIRONMENTAL,\n            environmental conservation, environmental issues,\n            ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, Environmental policies,\n            environmental stress, erosion, eutrophication, Exchange\n            Rate, export, externalities, farmers, Fish, fish\n            biodiversity, fish stocks, Fisheries, Fisheries Management,\n            fisheries science, fishers, fishery products, fishing,\n            fishing time, flood protection, forest, forest areas,\n            hydrology, illegal fishing, impacts, industrial waste,\n            industrial water, intakes, International Waters,\n            inventories, LAKE, Lake Management, lakes, Land Management,\n            Land Use, land use plans, local livelihoods, Management,\n            natural resources, natural wetlands, nature, nitrogen,\n            nutrients, Oxygen Demand, pesticides, phosphorus, point\n            sources, Pollution, power generation, programs, project,\n            public awareness, public goods, public health, Quality\n            Assurance, quality of water, rainfall, research agenda,\n            riparian, riparian countries, riparian states, rivers,\n            Sciences, scientific research, Sedimentation, silt, soil\n            conservation, soil erosion, spawning grounds, species,\n            sustainable management, sustainable use, sustainable use of\n            wetlands, tertiary treatment, Waste Management, waste water,\n            Wastewater, Wastewater Treatment, Water Conservation, water\n            quality, water quality monitoring, water supply, watershed,\n            Wetland, Wetland Management, wetlands, wetlands buffering\n            capacity, Wetlands Management"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 2 (AFTS2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028663-GET-PPA LAKE VICTORIA ENVIR.

In particular, significant delays\n            have been experienced with project implementation in Uganda,\n            and Kenya over the course o f the last two years. The\n            additional finance is considered necessary because of\n            unforeseen cost overruns, because due to the unanticipated\n            delays in the Partner countries, Tanzania is now facing a\n            cost overrun, and if the Government of Tanzania (GOT) is to\n            continue implementation alongside Uganda and Kenya,\n            additional resources will be required. This supplemental\n            credit would finance LVEMP work between now and December 3\n            1,2005. Specifically, the agreed work program includes the\n            following items: a) Fisheries Research; b) Fisheries\n            Management; c) Water Hyacinth control; d) Water Quality and\n            Ecosystem Management; e) Wetlands Management; f) Integrated\n            Soil and Water Conservation; g) Catchment Afforestation; h)\n            Support to Riparian Universities; i) Micro projects; j)\n            Community Participation; and, k) National Regional\n            Secretariat. The proposed Supplemental Credit would help\n            ensure realization of the expected benefits of promoting\n            sustainable use of the natural resources of the Lake, and\n            its catchment.
