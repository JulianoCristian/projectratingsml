To address these shortcomings, the World Bank\n            together with other donors in 1991 launched a Second Health,\n            Population, and Rural Water Project. By 1998, nearly 300 new\n            community health centers had been built, one-third of which\n            were directly financed by the project. The percentage of the\n            population living within 15 kilometers of a health facility\n            more than doubled from 17 percent in 1995 to 39 percent in\n            1998. The community clinics have been largely successful in\n            improving service coverage and client satisfaction. In\n            addition, community management committees were established\n            for some government clinics, although staffs continue to be\n            employed by the government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Improving access to rural health services"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Improving access to rural\n            health services"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23800347/mali-improving-access-rural-health-services","count":"Malawi","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"clinics, communities, community health,\n            countryside, drugs, health care, health care system, health\n            centers, health sector, Health Services, local communities,\n            Water Project"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","topic":"Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Rural Health m1327297 1317,Health Education m1327026 1463","projn":"MW-Phn Sector Credit -- P001646","subtopic":"Health Law,Population Policies,Hygiene Promotion and Social Marketing,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Law and Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Supply and Sanitation","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150115143133"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","theme":"Child health,Gender,Malaria,Nutrition and food security,Population and reproductive health","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Law and Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Rural Health m1327297 1317,Health Education m1327026 1463","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C"],"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF020430-AUSTRIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF020460-NORWEGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF021070-SWEDISH (SIDA) CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF021915-POPULATION, HEALTH &\n            NUTRITION SECTOR,TF026425-ODA-PHN SECTOR CREDIT,TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.

From a project\n            implementation viewpoint, the project succeeded in\n            implementing almost all the programmed activities, notably\n            the completion of an ambitious civil works program and\n            expansion in the supply of community health workers.\n            However, inappropriate project design and lack of supportive\n            policy environment led to a situation where satisfactory\n            implementation of activities did not lead to desired\n            outcomes. Thus, access to quality and effective health care\n            remains generally difficult due to continuing shortage in\n            key inputs such as drugs, other medical supplies, and\n            trained health professionals. As a result, the\n            project's long-term development objectives remained\n            largely unmet by project's end. The Bank appraisal team\n            apparently did not recognize the inappropriateness of a\n            multi-focal, multi-component, multi-implementor project\n            design for a country with limited management capacity. The\n            flawed project design haunted the project throughout its\n            life. Very few staff in the implementing agencies were\n            trained to have a noticeable effect on the capacity of these\n            agencies over the long term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -
