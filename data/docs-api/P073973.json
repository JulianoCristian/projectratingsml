Some lessons\n            learned included: micro-project (MP) investments allow for a\n            more manageable, adjustable and relatively transparent\n            implementation process. In a context of overall limited\n            institutional capacity, these mechanisms can potentially\n            magnify a project's development impact. The VIP\n            experience has shown that communities can implement micro\n            projects much more efficiently than local administrations in\n            terms of speed and costs. Community contributions amounted\n            to almost double the expected amount, thus indicating that\n            communities can make substantial own contributions given\n            that they are involved during the whole implementation\n            process from the identification of priorities, to\n            implementation and monitoring. Annually repetitive nature of\n            the investments within four years empowers communities,\n            strengthens their capacity through learning by doing, and\n            encourages the poor and vulnerable to participate in the VIP\n            processes. Indeed, the beneficiary impact assessment found\n            increased participation by such people in the later years of\n            village participation. One key to creating high quality\n            organizations in a developing country context is successful\n            resistance to nepotism and other forms of favoritism in\n            personnel selection and management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Village Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Village\n            Investment

Over the last two years, the\n            Village Investment Project has supported 1,600\n            micro-projects in about 80 different categories - from\n            pushbutton traffic lights that save the lives of school\n            children crossing busy roads, to school heating systems,\n            bridges, health posts, computer centers, machinery\n            workshops, textile cooperatives, storefronts and even a\n            morgue.

A\n            financial return assessment conducted last year found that\n            most projects had spectacular rates of return because of the\n            thriftiness and ingenuity of the villagers who co-financed\n            them.
