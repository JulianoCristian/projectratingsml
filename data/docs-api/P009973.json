The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Quality at entry is essential to ensure the successful\n            preparation and implementation of a complex multi-state\n            project. 2) The early formation of an exclusive, empowered\n            project implementation unit with strong implementation\n            capabilities is important to ensure higher quality at entry\n            and effective project implementation. 3) The preparation and\n            implementation of a multi-state project have proven to be\n            ineffective due to a reduced sense of ownership by the\n            participating states and inadequate supervision resources\n            provided by the Bank. 4) Adequate maintenance funding\n            together with improved maintenance planning is essential to\n            ensure the sustainability of project outcomes. 5) Without\n            appropriate arrangements for the operation and maintenance\n            of equipment and machinery procured under the project, the\n            sustainability of this component will probably be\n            unsatisfactory. 6) The pre-qualification of financially and\n            technically weak contractors had a negative effect in the\n            implementation of the civil works component of the project.\n            7) The primary focus of the project was on the physical\n            improvement of the core state road network, and not enough\n            emphasis was placed on the project design, which were\n            intended to support the stated development of the\n            institutional improvement to the implementing agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
