performance, and which includes\n            measures to strengthen the railway's organization,\n            management, and staff training. To complement the action\n            program, the project also provides for some important\n            physical investments designed to improve productivity. The\n            main components are: (i) track renewal (about 60 km); (ii)\n            procurement of track maintenance equipment and materials,\n            spare parts for motive power and rolling stock and workshop\n            equipment; (iii) extension and rehabilitation works at the\n            Dakar-Bel Air marshalling yard; (iv) a three-year training\n            program for selected middle- and high-level managers and\n            about 300 skilled laborers and low-level supervisors\n            annually; and (v) consulting services for studies. The\n            project will yield direct benefits mainly from\n            rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and rolling stock."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Third Railway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Third Railway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/01/727106/senegal-third-railway-project","projn":"SN-Railways Iii-267258 -- P002301","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Common Carriers Industry,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Transport and Trade Logistics","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Senegal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912191829"},"subsc":"Railways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting procedures,air\n            routes,airports,Auditing,audits,autonomy,Aviation,Balance\n            Sheet,Bank supervision,CABLES,cargo,cargo\n            traffic,cation,cement,CFS,Civil\n            works,commodities,customs,customs procedures,Domestic\n            passenger,domestic traffic,export,financial\n            management,financial performance,financial\n            planning,financial risk,Fiscal Year,Freight,Freight\n            Traffic,Highway,highway\n            maintenance,Income,inflation,international\n            port,international traffic,inventory,loading,Motive\n            Power,national airport,operating costs,operating\n            efficiency,Passenger,Passenger Traffic,paved\n            roads,pavement,pavement\n            strengthening,productivity,Railways,rate of\n            return,Reference,reorganization,road deterioration,road\n            network,road tariffs,road\n            transport,roads,route,seaports,shipping,shipping\n            companies,signs,square,technical\n            assistance,terminal,tonnage,trade unions,Traffic,traffic\n            development,traffic levels,traffic\n            volumes,Transport,transport modes,Transport\n            Planning,transport tariffs,trucking,trucks,Wages,working\n            capital,working costs"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting procedures,air\n            routes,airports,Auditing,audits,autonomy,Aviation,Balance\n            Sheet,Bank supervision,CABLES,cargo,cargo\n            traffic,cation,cement,CFS,Civil\n            works,commodities,customs,customs procedures,Domestic\n            passenger,domestic traffic,export,financial\n            management,financial performance,financial\n            planning,financial risk,Fiscal Year,Freight,Freight\n            Traffic,Highway,highway\n            maintenance,Income,inflation,international\n            port,international traffic,inventory,loading,Motive\n            Power,national airport,operating costs,operating\n            efficiency,Passenger,Passenger Traffic,paved\n            roads,pavement,pavement\n            strengthening,productivity,Railways,rate of\n            return,Reference,reorganization,road deterioration,road\n            network,road tariffs,road\n            transport,roads,route,seaports,shipping,shipping\n            companies,signs,square,technical\n            assistance,terminal,tonnage,trade unions,Traffic,traffic\n            development,traffic levels,traffic\n            volumes,Transport,transport modes,Transport\n            Planning,transport tariffs,trucking,trucks,Wages,working\n            capital,working costs"}},"owner":"WB:Dakar-FmcAFR1:SN/CV/CM/GW/MR (AFCF1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"1691"},"facets":{}}}
