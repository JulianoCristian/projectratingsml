The proposed studies would\n            include preparation of master plans for water supply and\n            sanitation, and for urban development; review of existing\n            tariff and accounting systems with recommendations for\n            improvement; training program for staff of the principal\n            project implementing agency; and detailed design and bidding\n            documents for a first stage construction program to be\n            carried out under a possible future project. The priority\n            works provided for would include development of four\n            additional wells to increase Cotonou's water production\n            capacity, and the extension of the
