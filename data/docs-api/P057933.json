Some lessons\n            learned included: the requirement for all Wastewater\n            Treatment Plants (WWTPs) in the Tai Lake Protection Area to\n            introduce tertiary treatment demonstrates the\n            government's commitment to pollution reduction.\n            However, through its application irrespective of the size of\n            the facility of jurisdiction, it ignores the costs and\n            benefits, and practical realities of the incremental cost,\n            feasibility of levying adequate tariffs, and the technical\n            capacity necessary to operate such plants, especially by\n            small towns that operate plants with capacities of 5,000 m/d\n            to 15,000 m/d. The requirement also runs the risk that small\n            towns may construct such plants to comply with the\n            requirement, but may not operate them for practical reasons.\n            It is therefore necessary to develop an incremental approach\n            to treatment standards taking account of ground realities\n            depending on the size of facilities and the capacity of\n            small towns. The institutional model defined by the Bank for\n            the wastewater services in the project was clearly not\n            appropriate in the context of institutional development\n            trends and choices in China. The project design and\n            covenants called for corporatization of services, wastewater\n            tariffs set at full cost-recovery levels without any\n            subsidies, and independent utility companies free of direct\n            government intervention and responsible for creating funds\n            for asset replacement. The ultimate objective of this model\n            was to provide effective wastewater collection and treatment\n            services in the project areas. The project reduced\n            point-source pollution discharges through wastewater\n            collection and treatment in the project cities. However,\n            control of point-source pollution alone will not be adequate\n            to improve water quality in the Lake Tai Basin. Technical\n            reports of the Lake Tai basin indicate that non-point source\n            pollution now constitutes about 50 percent of the total\n            pollution loads that enter the water systems, primarily from\n            agricultural sources and untreated urban runoff. It would\n            therefore be appropriate for future projects to include both\n            point- and non-point source pollution interventions in the\n            same operation, or address non-point source pollution separately."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

During the\n            design phase, water discharge structures for the wastewater\n            treatment plants will be designed to control the discharge\n            of safe water flows, and, the collection and treatment of\n            odorous gases shall be considered. During construction,\n            water should be sprayed on working sites, transport routes,\n            and on material stockpiles. To reduce noise disturbances, a\n            work activity timetable will be worked out. Water and land\n            traffic plans will be coordinated with central urban traffic\n            authorities. Temporary treatment facilities such as water\n            collecting tanks, sedimentation tanks, oil separating tanks,\n            and water drainage ditches will be built to treat wastewater\n            produced during works. To prevent contamination from septic\n            tanks, and in groundwater, wastewater treatment facilities\n            will be built. Construction debris and contaminated soil\n            will be disposed of appropriately, at selected landfills,\n            strictly forbidding waste disposal on rivers, lakes, or sea.\n            During the operational period, temporary emergency measures\n            will be in use to avoid direct discharge of wastewater in\n            the event of power supply failures, overflows, equipment\n            failures, or other adverse conditions. Other measures\n            include: treatment of domestic wastewater prior to\n            discharges, with simple sedimentation tanks; and, location\n            of work sites should be at an agreed distance, away from\n            residential sites.

It describes\n            mitigation measures to reduce expected negative\n            environmental impacts, discussed as follows. During the\n            design phase, water discharge structures for the wastewater\n            treatment plants will be designed to control the discharge\n            of safe water flows, and, the collection and treatment of\n            odorous gases shall be considered. During construction,\n            water should be sprayed on working sites, transport routes,\n            and on material stockpiles. To reduce noise disturbances, a\n            work activity timetable will be worked out. Water and land\n            traffic plans will be coordinated with central urban traffic\n            authorities. Temporary treatment facilities such as water\n            collecting tanks, sedimentation tanks, oil separating tanks,\n            and water drainage ditches will be built to treat wastewater\n            produced during works. To prevent contamination from septic\n            tanks, and in groundwater, wastewater treatment facilities\n            will be built. Construction debris and contaminated soil\n            will be disposed of appropriately, at selected landfills,\n            strictly forbidding waste disposal on rivers, lakes, or sea.\n            During the operational period, temporary emergency measures\n            will be in use to avoid direct discharge of wastewater in\n            the event of power supply failures, overflows, equipment\n            failures, or other adverse conditions. Other measures\n            include: treatment of domestic wastewater prior to\n            discharges, with simple sedimentation tanks; and, location\n            of work sites should be at an agreed distance, away from\n            residential sites. Sites and roads should be sprayed\n            frequently, while replanting of trees and vegetative\n            propagation should follow construction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Supplementary information
