Key lessons show high\n            responsiveness to the export program by the small and medium\n            enterprises (SMEs), particularly regarding competitiveness\n            improvement mechanisms. Nonetheless, and although the\n            project tried to reduce the financial burden on the SMEs by\n            allowing partial grant payments, as required by exporting\n            practices, matching program grants can be hindered by lack\n            of access to credit by the SMEs to finance export consulting\n            contracts, or to implement the recommended changes. It is\n            thus suggested that export plans may be divided into stages,\n            or modules so as to provide frequent reimbursement to\n            enterprises, reduce their financial burden, and allow in\n            turn, the introduction of experienced export changes,\n            provided greater export credit accessibility is explored\n            through financial institutions in the country. Apparent\n            difficulties resulted from the use of a private management\n            service contract managing a Government program, since in the\n            context of Argentina, delegation of administrative authority\n            to a private operator, limits its role to that of ex-post\n            performance evaluator, exacerbated by the many approval\n            conditions required for replenishment of revolving funds.\n            Hence, delimitation of respective roles, specific\n            information requirements, and the use of performance\n            incentives should be ensured, under review by an external panel."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

The\n            project will help firms to become more internationally\n            competitive through three avenues: 1) the project will help\n            increase awareness among entrepreneurs about export\n            opportunities through the provision of basic information\n            about foreign markets and profitable export strategies; 2)\n            the project will prompt a limited number of enterprises to\n            invest their own resources in productivity improvements and\n            export development expenditures through the incentive of a\n            one-time grant to share these costs; and 3) the project will\n            help to improve the performance of agencies providing\n            quality control and certification services. The project will\n            also facilitate export growth by supporting the\n            simplification and reduction of export procedures. It will\n            have two main components: 1) an enterprise assistance\n            program to develop export competencies in the private sector\n            in manufacturing and service

- Enterprise Export Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The primary objectives of the Export\n            Support Project are to help increase the international\n            competitiveness of small and medium scale enterprises in\n            Argentina and to improve the performance of export-related\n            public agencies, thus facilitating export growth. The\n            project will help firms to become more internationally\n            competitive through three avenues: 1) the project will help\n            increase awareness among entrepreneurs about export\n            opportunities through the provision of basic information\n            about foreign markets and profitable export strategies; 2)\n            the project will prompt a limited number of enterprises to\n            invest their own resources in productivity improvements and\n            export development expenditures through the incentive of a\n            one-time grant to share these costs; and 3) the project will\n            help to improve the performance of agencies providing\n            quality control and certification services. The project will\n            also facilitate export growth by supporting the\n            simplification and reduction of export procedures. It will\n            have two main components: 1) an enterprise assistance\n            program to develop export competencies in the private sector\n            in manufacturing and service industries; and 2) an\n            institutional strengthening to help improve the performance\n            of export-related public agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Enterprise Export Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Enterprise Export\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/11/732615/argentina-enterprise-export-development-project","projn":"AR-Ent.Export Dv. -- P038883","subtopic":"Health Economics & Finance,Free Trade,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008055632"},"subsc":"Micro- and SME finance,Central Government","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,International Economics and Trade","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            products,agriculture,auditing,BANK LOANS,Bank\n            Privatization,capital flight,capital goods,Capital\n            Markets,checking,commodities,competitive\n            position,competitiveness,consumers,CURRENCY,Customs\n            Administration,Debt,deficits,demonstration\n            effects,Deregulation,Development\n            Projects,devolution,dumping,Economic\n            Cooperation,employment,environmental issues,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,export bias,export growth,export\n            market,export markets,export opportunities,export\n            performance,export value,exporters,exports,Financial\n            Sector,Financial Services,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,foreign market,foreign markets,Health Sector,import\n            restrictions,Imports,incremental benefits,industrial\n            sector,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            competitiveness,international interest rates,international\n            trade,macroeconomic conditions,macroeconomic\n            stability,market prices,Municipal Development,Oil,open trade\n            regime,policy environment,Price Contingencies,Private\n            Sector,privatization,producers,production\n            technology,productivity,public agencies,quality\n            standards,real exchange rate,risk premium,Tax\n            Administration,tax incentives,Technical\n            Assistance,Timber,Total Costs,trade deficit,trade\n            flows,Trade liberalization,trade policies,trade policy,trade\n            regime,trade regimes,Value Added,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            products,agriculture,auditing,BANK LOANS,Bank\n            Privatization,capital flight,capital goods,Capital\n            Markets,checking,commodities,competitive\n            position,competitiveness,consumers,CURRENCY,Customs\n            Administration,Debt,deficits,demonstration\n            effects,Deregulation,Development\n            Projects,devolution,dumping,Economic\n            Cooperation,employment,environmental issues,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,export bias,export growth,export\n            market,export markets,export opportunities,export\n            performance,export value,exporters,exports,Financial\n            Sector,Financial Services,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,foreign market,foreign markets,Health Sector,import\n            restrictions,Imports,incremental benefits,industrial\n            sector,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            competitiveness,international interest rates,international\n            trade,macroeconomic conditions,macroeconomic\n            stability,market prices,Municipal Development,Oil,open trade\n            regime,policy environment,Price Contingencies,Private\n            Sector,privatization,producers,production\n            technology,productivity,public agencies,quality\n            standards,real exchange rate,risk premium,Tax\n            Administration,tax incentives,Technical\n            Assistance,Timber,Total Costs,trade deficit,trade\n            flows,Trade liberalization,trade policies,trade policy,trade\n            regime,trade regimes,Value Added,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Private Sector Cluster (LCSFR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF022176-PHRD 2-PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM I/PSDPS","repnb":"P6692"},"facets":{}}}
