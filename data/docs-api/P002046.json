The Agricultural Development Projects (ADPs) were\n            initiated in the mid-1970s as Nigeria's oil production\n            and revenues were rapidly expanding and stimulating rapid\n            urban growth. At the same time, Government adopted policies\n            which maintained the value of the Naira at a high level. The\n            potential detrimental impact of these changes on\n            agricultural production became a cause for concern. The ADPs\n            were designed to increase crop production through a\n            coordinated approach to rural development. The main elements\n            were improved technology (and the means to get it to\n            farmers), increased supplies of farming inputs (especially\n            fertilizer), and extensive infrastructure improvements\n            (especially rural roads and water supplies). The major focus\n            of this study is, therefore, on the economic, agricultural,\n            social and environmental impacts of the technologies\n            promoted by the ADPs to improve the land and water\n            management of the fadama areas. Special consideration is\n            given to the lessons of this experience for the on-going ADP\n            related program in Nigeria (including the follow-on National\n            Fadama Development Project (NFDP), currently under\n            implementation) and for the development of fadama type areas\n            elsewhere in West Africa."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
