Lessons\n            learned include: fiscal sustainability of rapid expansion of\n            secondary education needs to be reassessed carefully within\n            the realistic context of limited fiscal resources and\n            competing needs of other education subsectors. The\n            unprecedented rate of expansion of community secondary\n            schools is putting extreme pressure on the education budget.\n            In recent years the government responded by reducing per\n            unit resources which in turn compromises the quality of\n            secondary education. Finding the financial resources to\n            complete the job of building quality into the expanded\n            system is an enormous challenge to be resolved by the\n            government and development partners. Rapid expansion of\n            secondary education is more complex and difficult than\n            rapidly expanding primary education. Secondary education\n            systems have subject specialties requiring efficient\n            matching of student class streams and teachers; teacher\n            shortages and lack of capacity limit the ability to increase\n            the number of teachers of appropriate qualifications\n            rapidly; curriculum, textbooks, and examinations need to be\n            reformed simultaneously; and the management challenge\n            inherent in rapid expansion and reform simultaneously would\n            tax even the most capable systems of education. The labor\n            market situation warrants closer and careful monitoring as\n            the supply of secondary school leavers is increasing. There\n            is a risk of creating an increasing pool of unemployed\n            secondary graduates as a consequence of the overly rapid\n            expansion of relatively low quality community secondary schools."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Human Resource Development Pilot\n            Project, Primary Education Development Program Project, and\n            Secondary Education

sustainability likely, and institutional development impacts\n            are substantial. Lessons reinforce the notions that adapting\n            flexibility in the process of project implementation is\n            usually necessary; that continuous community sensitization,\n            training and support during the project implementation are\n            needed to enhance active participation of different\n            stakeholders for improved school management; and, that\n            Project design should always pay attention to monitoring and\n            evaluation aspects, while regarding capacity building,\n            Project design should consider using local systems as much\n            as possible. However, it is suggested funds allocated for\n            quality improvement were small. The reason was that schools\n            were free to choose the items to include in their plans, so\n            interventions varied greatly. The lessons learned showed\n            that earmarking specific financial allocations for quality\n            improvements, such as teaching and learning materials is\n            important. It is highlighted that girls' selection, a\n            process that relies on head teachers and the village council\n            in a transparent setting, while far from perfect, is likely\n            to be better than having the selection made by an external\n            agency with no personal knowledge of the people being\n            considered. A combination of selection methods for\n            scholarships that would include the village level processes\n            with oversight by a committee of peers would be appropriate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -
