The objectives of their programs are to\n            meet the needs of the market efficiently and to remedy\n            unsatisfactory conditions arising from inadequate planning\n            and lack of sufficient investment during preceeding years.\n            Their programs provide for the purchase and installation of\n            equipment, consultant services and the formulation of plans\n            that give emphasis to the connection of rural and low-income\n            consumers. The project will substantially strengthen the\n            operations of ELETROBRAS, especially its project selection,\n            appraisal and supervision capability. In addition it will\n            provide institutional support and strengthening to the beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - ELETROBRAS Power Distribution Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - ELETROBRAS Power\n            Distribution Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/04/726078/brazil-eletrobras-power-distribution-project","projn":"BR-Eletrobras Distribut -- P006323","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Engineering,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912532274"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,alternative energy,amount of\n            oil,assets,audits,Bank loans,blast furnaces,bonds,cement\n            industry,centralization,charcoal,coal,coal\n            reserves,cogeneration,commercial banks,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            demand,conservation,consumers,consumption of\n            energy,cooking,covers,debt,development projects,domestic\n            energy,Economic analysis,elasticity,electric power,electric\n            power sector,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            generation,electricity production,electricity sales,energy\n            consumption,Energy demand,energy policies,energy\n            policy,energy resources,energy sources,Energy supply,energy\n            utilization,engines,Exchange rate,exploitation,fossil\n            fuels,fuel,fuel substitution,fuels,furnaces,gasoline\n            consumption,gasoline demand,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,growth rate,imports,income,industrial\n            boilers,inflation,interest rates,intermediate\n            goods,legislation,marginal cost,marginal costs,Mines,natural\n            gas,nuclear plants,oil,oil equivalent,oil\n            prices,optimization,peak demand,Petroleum,petroleum\n            gas,petroleum products,population growth,Power\n            Distribution,power generation,pressure,price of\n            electricity,primary energy,production of\n            electricity,productivity,property taxes,proven oil\n            reserves,rational use of energy,resource allocation,Rural\n            Electrification,structures,tidal energy,total electricity\n            generation,transport,utilities,waste,world oil"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,alternative energy,amount of\n            oil,assets,audits,Bank loans,blast furnaces,bonds,cement\n            industry,centralization,charcoal,coal,coal\n            reserves,cogeneration,commercial banks,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            demand,conservation,consumers,consumption of\n            energy,cooking,covers,debt,development projects,domestic\n            energy,Economic analysis,elasticity,electric power,electric\n            power sector,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            generation,electricity production,electricity sales,energy\n            consumption,Energy demand,energy policies,energy\n            policy,energy resources,energy sources,Energy supply,energy\n            utilization,engines,Exchange rate,exploitation,fossil\n            fuels,fuel,fuel substitution,fuels,furnaces,gasoline\n            consumption,gasoline demand,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,growth rate,imports,income,industrial\n            boilers,inflation,interest rates,intermediate\n            goods,legislation,marginal cost,marginal costs,Mines,natural\n            gas,nuclear plants,oil,oil equivalent,oil\n            prices,optimization,peak demand,Petroleum,petroleum\n            gas,petroleum products,population growth,Power\n            Distribution,power generation,pressure,price of\n            electricity,primary energy,production of\n            electricity,productivity,property taxes,proven oil\n            reserves,rational use of energy,resource allocation,Rural\n            Electrification,structures,tidal energy,total electricity\n            generation,transport,utilities,waste,world oil"}},"owner":"WB Office: Brasilia, Brazil CMU (LCC5C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"3338"},"facets":{}}}
