Lessons stress the importance of\n            careful analyses of poverty data, for it lays the foundation\n            for cost-sharing proposals, and contributions, which no\n            matter how relatively small these may seem, it may however\n            translate into a major burden for family budgets. The\n            efficacy of project implementation units (PIUs) should\n            uniquely lie, on an ad hoc basis, to streamline, and\n            accelerate project specific procedures; however, some PIUs\n            evolve into seemingly, powerful entities. Therefore, the\n            development of institutional capacity within existing\n            services, is suggested, including the dissolution of this\n            PIU, but reintegrating its staff into line directorates.\n            Conversely, the volunteer teacher program is a good example\n            of a naturally assimilated reform, whose acceptance -\n            through African educators - is growing in other countries in\n            the sub-region. In addition, school construction could be\n            more competitive, by providing opportunities to small and\n            medium enterprises who possess technical competence, and,\n            school book distribution schemes could profit from adequate\n            private sector incentives. Moreover, the school development\n            fund proved that disbursement flexibility to poorly educated\n            groups, empowers them in identifying their needs, and in\n            turn, provides timely information assistance for project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Second Human Resources Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Second Human

for the\n            period 1993-98 which aims mainly to improve access to, and\n            the quality and efficiency, of primary education, with the\n            specific targets of raising the primary enrollment ratio\n            from 58% in 1992 to 65% by 1988.  Secondary objectives\n            include improving the quality and efficiency of secondary\n            and higher education and strengthening education sector\n            planning and management.  To achieve these objectives, the\n            project supports policy measures:  (a) in primary education\n            to contain costs, diversify sources of financing, and reduce\n            inequities between urban and rural areas, and between boys\n            and girls; (b) in secondary education to improve internal\n            efficiency; and (c) in sector planning and management, to\n            decentralize education planning, administration and\n            supervision to the regional and departmental levels.  In\n            addition, the project will finance investments designed to:\n            (a) expand access to primary education and improve its\n            quality and efficiency; (b) improve the quality and\n            efficiency of secondary and higher education; and (c)\n            strengthen sector planning and management capacities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Second Human Resources
