Lessons for\n            disaster recovery suggested by the experience of these\n            projects included: 1) The support the Bank promptly provided\n            enabled people to survive, put funds into the economy, and\n            was reported as highly preferable to in-kind support by\n            beneficiaries. 2)  Greater accuracy of damage assessments is\n            still needed to avoid unnecessary construction. 3)\n            Addressing the social and economic recovery aspects of\n            emergency projects, although difficult, is critical for the\n            sustainability of the reconstruction investments. 4)\n            Creating New Disaster Management Institutions takes more\n            time than is available under one project. 5) Cash Transfer\n            projects can make an extremely important contribution to\n            recovery. Getting cash support to victims quickly positively\n            affected the economy and perhaps even affected people's\n            sense of safety and security.
