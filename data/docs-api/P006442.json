The Management announces it\n            is well aware of the problems described in the Request and\n            provides data concerning the completion of the irrigation\n            projects.  The Response addresses the complaints that the\n            Bank's guidelines were not followed and that the\n            resettled communities are unable to resume production\n            because of the irrigation problems. The Management Response\n            elaborates on the fact that other agencies were primarily\n            responsible for several aspects of the project and that the\n            Management's involvement was therefore limited.  The\n            Management concludes that it complied with all their\n            guidelines, but there were still delays and insufficiencies\n            throughout the implementation of  the project.  Through\n            cooperation with the Government of Brazil and other agencies\n            involved with the project, the Management feels that they\n            will complete the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Itaparica Resettlement and\n            Irrigation Project : Management Response to the Request for Inspection"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Itaparica Resettlement\n            and Irrigation Project : Management Response to the Request\n            for Inspection"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/03/3144355/brazil-itaparica-resettlement-irrigation-project-management-response-request-inspection","projn":"BR-Itaparica Project -- P006442","docty":"Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Housing,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000265513_20040412161019"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Renewable energy,Other social services,General transportation sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Energy and mining,Health and other social services,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Borrower,building\n            materials,commitment,communities,construction,contractors,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,disbursement,disbursements,education,electric\n            power,employment,engineers,equipment,Extension,families,farmers,Fisheries,guarantor,health,homes,houses,land\n            titling,LOAN,Loan Agreement,loan amount,maintenance\n            payments,quality of life,Resettlement,rural housing,rural\n            population,rural settlements,schools,social services,social\n            support,soils,subsidiary,towns,urban areas,urban settlements,villages,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Borrower,building\n            materials,commitment,communities,construction,contractors,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,disbursement,disbursements,education,electric\n            power,employment,engineers,equipment,Extension,families,farmers,Fisheries,guarantor,health,homes,houses,land\n            titling,LOAN,Loan Agreement,loan amount,maintenance\n            payments,quality of life,Resettlement,rural housing,rural\n            population,rural settlements,schools,social services,social\n            support,soils,subsidiary,towns,urban areas,urban settlements,villages,waste"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"28463"},"3144869":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/03/3144869/brazil-itaparica-resettlement-irrigation-project-eligibility-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/03/3144869/brazil-itaparica-resettlement-irrigation-project-eligibility-report","new_url":"1997/03/3144869/brazil-itaparica-resettlement-irrigation-project-eligibility-report","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/04/12/000265513_20040412170728/Rendered/INDEX/28464.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/04/12/000265513_20040412170728/Rendered/PDF/28464.pdf","loan_no":"2883","datestored":"2004-04-12T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1997-03-12T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Itaparica Resettlement and\n            Irrigation Project : Eligibility Report"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Eligibility Report for the Itaparica\n            Resettlement and Irrigation Project in Brazil retraces the\n            Request for Inspection and the Management Response,\n            including detailed reports of each complaint to be\n            investigated.
