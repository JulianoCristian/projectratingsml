The project\n            expands access to and improves the quality of services that\n            address young children's basic needs. Ratings for the\n            Education Improvement Project for Republic of Serbia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project were that national ownership and\n            buy-in is important in achieving development outcomes; PMTs\n            can be functional if focused and adequately supported; it is\n            very common to underestimate the risk of insufficient\n            M&E capacity, especially in multi-sectoral,\n            decentralized operations as these require both horizontal\n            and vertical links; considering the intent of delivering an\n            integrated package of services, it would be advisable to\n            design project components around the level of\n            implementation; and formal, well coordinated partnership\n            among all the involved development partners, local and\n            international, is

   and holistic development of Eritrean children. The project\n            expands access to and improves the quality of services that\n            address young children's basic needs. There are five\n            project components. The first improves child health by\n            providing on-the-job and pre-service training to health\n            workers and caregivers; financing drugs, medical equipment,\n            and supplies and strengthening procurement, storage, and\n            distribution mechanisms; promoting adoption of healthy\n            practices such as breastfeeding and the correct treatment of\n            infections; using environmental health interventions to\n            control childhood illnesses; and improving communications\n            for behavioral change; The second component builds\n            capacities for families and communities for improving the\n            nutritional and health status of children, by reducing\n            micro- and macro-nutrient deficiency and improving food\n            security; and builds capacity within ministries to implement\n            the nutrition component. The third component improves\n            quality and access to early childhood education, and\n            institutional capacity at all administrative levels. The\n            fourth component strengthens the traditional safety nets for\n            child care and protection through community-based\n            reintegration and pycho-social support for orphans. Beside\n            supporting the over-all management of the multi-sectoral\n            program, the fifth component funds advocacy and\n            sensitization campaigns and establishes an
