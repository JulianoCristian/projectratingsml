           reinforcement and reorganization of research efforts, the\n            expansion of farming systems and on-farm research, better\n            linkages between research and extension activities, and the\n            improvement of research management; (d) development,\n            rehabilitation and equipping of research station facilities\n            and other essential agricultural and laboratory equipment;\n            (e) provision of a soils map of Rwanda; and (f) support to\n            the Agriculture Faculty and to the Department of Geography\n            of the University of Rwanda to increase the research\n            capabilities of students and faculty."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Agricultural Research
