Lessons drawn from the\n            project are suggested as follows. The project success is\n            indeed attributable to the use of the 'Project\n            Management Unit' (PMU), which had an autonomous status\n            under the Albanian Law. The PMU was able to attract\n            competent and committed professionals. In addition, the PMU\n            was able to minimize political interference, and facilitate\n            the development of water user associations (WUAs), which in\n            principle devolved the irrigation responsibilities from the\n            Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MoAF) to farmers (WUAs).\n            However, the implementation of the project through the PMU\n            left the line MoAF without any capacity. This is becoming a\n            major risk to the sustainability of project impacts. At\n            project completion, a discussion started as to how best\n            utilize the PMU's expertise to improve MoAF's\n            capacity and governance. The project also highlighted the\n            importance of providing infrastructure investment in\n            parallel to institutional reform. The investment not only\n            facilitated the WUAs' irrigation operation, and\n            improved service delivery; but also positively influenced\n            farmers' views on WUA development, encouraging their\n            own managerial responsibilities. Moreover, the success of\n            the project is due partly to its strong community\n            participation approach, where sub-projects were selected\n            based on farmers' up-front commitment to irrigation.\n            Finally, the project also suggested that an incremental\n            approach to monitoring and evaluation (M&E), starting\n            with a simple M&E system that would gradually develop\n            into a more complex one, can be effective in the long-run."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

This component will also address the soil\n            salinity issue, which, even though salinity may not be\n            present in most subproject areas, adjacent slope watershed\n            areas may contain infertile acid soils, conducive to poor\n            quality vegetation and high erosion degrees. To mitigate\n            these impacts, the study suggests the need for irrigation\n            and water quality to be monitored annually. Drainage water\n            samples should be analyzed for pesticide residues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Second Irrigation and Drainage\n            Rehabilitation Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Second Irrigation and\n            Drainage Rehabilitation Project : environmental assessment\n            (Vol. 4)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/01/441534/albania-second-irrigation-drainage-rehabilitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-4","projn":"AL-Irrigation & Drainage 2 Project -- P043178","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Wetlands,Drylands & Desertification,Water Conservation,Water Law","teratopic":"Environment,Law and Development,Water Resources","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99032505573261"},"subsc":"Flood protection,Irrigation and drainage,Central government administration,Other industry,Agricultural extension and research","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Law and Development,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animals,canals,chloride,clay,clays,climate,confluence,crops,dams,Drainage,drainage\n            facilities,drains,drip\n            irrigation,effluent,erosion,farmers,farming,fish,Flooding,fuelwood,grazing,grazing\n            animals,income,Irrigation,irrigation water,land\n            management,land tenure,land use,land use management,land\n            uses,limestone,maize,mitigation,monitoring\n            activities,nutrients,organic\n            matter,pesticides,pH,plantations,plots,project\n            watershed,Public Health,pumping,pumps,rainfall,rainfall\n            events,reservoir,reservoirs,Rivers,salinity,sediment,soil,soil\n            conservation,soil erosion,soil fertility,soil samples,soil\n            structure,soil types,Soils,upland areas,upland\n            land,uplands,vegetation,water conservation,water flows,Water\n            Monitoring,water quality,water samples,water\n            table,waters,watershed,watershed drains,watershed management,watersheds,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animals,canals,chloride,clay,clays,climate,confluence,crops,dams,Drainage,drainage\n            facilities,drains,drip\n            irrigation,effluent,erosion,farmers,farming,fish,Flooding,fuelwood,grazing,grazing\n            animals,income,Irrigation,irrigation water,land\n            management,land tenure,land use,land use management,land\n            uses,limestone,maize,mitigation,monitoring\n            activities,nutrients,organic\n            matter,pesticides,pH,plantations,plots,project\n            watershed,Public Health,pumping,pumps,rainfall,rainfall\n            events,reservoir,reservoirs,Rivers,salinity,sediment,soil,soil\n            conservation,soil erosion,soil fertility,soil samples,soil\n            structure,soil types,Soils,upland areas,upland\n            land,uplands,vegetation,water conservation,water flows,Water\n            Monitoring,water quality,water samples,water\n            table,waters,watershed,watershed drains,watershed management,watersheds,wheat"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF029407-PHRD-TOURISM II/URBAN UPGRADING/,TF021259-PHRD 2 - IN DEPTH REVIEW OF THE\n            PERFORMANCE & IMPACT OF THE,TF040058-ALBANIA - 2ND IRRIGATION AND\n            DRAINAGE REHABILITATION - WATER MANAGEMENT,TF037576-ALBANIA - IRRIGATION AND\n            DRAINAGE II,TF035586-MOROCCO - FISHERIES PROJECT AND\n            GENERAL SECTOR WORKS,TF033526-ALBANIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF025532-PHRD-SECOND IRRIGATION &\n            DRAINAGE REHABILITATIOB","repnb":"E247"},"facets":{}}}
