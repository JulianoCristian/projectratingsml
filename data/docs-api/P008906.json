This required a major change in procedures in\n            forest harvesting and marketing of the logs which was not\n            fully accomplished. Another lesson learned was that the Bank\n            was too optimistic on implementation and disbursements\n            schedule. Most of the delay was due to a general\n            deterioration of Turkey's economy during the period,\n            lack of local and foreign funds, and slowdown by suppliers\n            and contractors due to nonpayment. Another concern was the\n            major item of equipment, the chemical recovery boiler, which\n            was chiefly responsible for about two years' delay in\n            project completion. This stemmed from the fact that the\n            equipment was produced locally for the first time. While\n            Bank projects should certainly encourage local manufacturing\n            of equipment where appropriate, in a case such as this,\n            involving fairly sophisticated technology, it is important\n            to ensure adequate technical assistance is also provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Antalya Forest Utilization
