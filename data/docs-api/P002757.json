The audit confirms the following lessons. The\n            freedom to operate according to market principles\n            potentially makes the operational efficiency of privately\n            run concessions, superior to that of parastatal\n            organizations for ports and railways. Thus, the\n            concentration of investment with high volumes of traffic,\n            lower operational costs, and relative autonomy from\n            government, generally makes port concessions a relatively\n            low risk for investors. Yet, if railways are likely to incur\n            losses, and/or are inadequately compensated for uneconomic\n            services, investors will be hard to come, and therefore\n            bidding conditions, and the terms of the concession\n            agreement will need to take this fact into account. The\n            design of projects preparing parastatal companies for\n            privatization should also consider the capacity, and\n            commitment of government, and management to carry through\n            the reform process. Targets and timetables should be\n            realistic, and, special care should be placed in the\n            selection of qualified consultants preparing bidding documentation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Secod Port Modernization and\n            Railway Restructuring Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Secod Port\n            Modernization and Railway Restructuring Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6074299/tanzania-secod-port-modernization-railway-restructuring-projects","projn":"TZ-Railways Restructuri -- P002757,TZ-Ports Modernization -- P002784","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050719110307"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Railways,Roads and highways,Ports, waterways and shipping","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, accounting procedures, actions,\n            autonomy, Bank management, Bank Performance, beneficiaries,\n            berth, cargo, cargo handling, cargo handling equipment,\n            Cargo Traffic, civil works, commercial services, concession\n            agreement, congestion, construction, container berths,\n            container operations, Container Services, container storage\n            area, container storage areas, container terminal, container\n            terminals, container traffic, containers, Corridor, cost of\n            capital, Customs, customs clearance, customs clearance\n            agents, customs procedures, depots, development objectives,\n            domestic traffic, dry cargo, economic conditions, financial\n            management, financial performance, Fiscal Year, flexibility,\n            foreign exchange, freight, freight traffic, handling\n            equipment, Holding Company, improvements, Institutional\n            Development, landlocked countries, lighterage, manifests,\n            natural resources, net loss, passenger, peer review, Port\n            equipment, ports, present value, private concessionaire,\n            private sector, privatization, productivity, project\n            completion, Public Sector, quality at entry, range,\n            refugees, rural development, savings, sector work, shippers,\n            shipping, stakeholders, Sub-Saharan Africa, supervision,\n            surcharges, sustainability, technical assistance, terminal\n            operations, trade logistics, traffic, traffic Components,\n            traffic volume, transit, Transport, trucks"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"32659"},"2416058":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/06/2416058/tanzania-railways-restructuring-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/06/2416058/tanzania-railways-restructuring-project","new_url":"2003/06/2416058/tanzania-railways-restructuring-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/07/08/000012009_20030708125027/Rendered/INDEX/262320TZ0railways0ICR.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/07/08/000012009_20030708125027/Rendered/PDF/262320TZ0railways0ICR.pdf","credit_no":"2267","datestored":"2003-07-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-06-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Railways Restructuring Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Mixed results are conveyed by this\n            project assessment, given its outcome is rated\n            unsatisfactory, with an unlikely sustainability, yet\n            institutional development impacts are substantial, and both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. Lessons confirm in fact, that the project\n            succeeded much better than many similar railway projects,\n            with a rising freight traffic over the network of over\n            seventy five percent, having the Tanzania Railways\n            Corporation (TRC) achieved a much more commercial approach.\n            However, unless the basic incentive/sanction structures are\n            changed, technical assistance (TA) and training will have\n            little sustainable impact, unless the institutional culture\n            is substantially modified. Despite substantial emphasis\n            given to capacity building, institutional strength will not\n            necessarily be reflected in corporate performance, unless a\n            strong management orchestrates the entity. Likewise, the\n            corporate culture will change from within its continual\n            institutional framework, provided a new framework allows\n            full private management practices, as demonstrated by the\n            success of the Dar es Salaam Container Terminal stemming\n            from the time of its leasing to the private sector.\n            Moreover, while work unit targets were reached, with\n            incentive payments reaching an almost forty percent of the\n            basic salary cost, no improvement in corporate performance\n            was observed. The TRC incentive scheme needs to be carefully\n            designed, so as to be linked with corporate performance.\n            Further lessons demonstrate the importance of adequate\n            operation line management, which showed a rapid improvement\n            during the interim capacity enhancement program (ICEP)\n            following the concessioning decision aimed at increasing\n            locomotive availability, a proof of how the impact of\n            experienced, and motivated management can orchestrate the\n            potential capacity of an organization, and deploy it into\n            the corporate operational performance; and, the limited\n            private sector interest may be an understandable risk\n            aversion, but more interest may be generated through a\n            flexible criteria, that allows other interests to bid for\n            the concession."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Railways Restructuring
