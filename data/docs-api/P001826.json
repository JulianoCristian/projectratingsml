The project works would comprise\n            construction of a concrete dam (Foum el Gleita), a\n            conveyance canal, irrigation and drainage networks, service\n            roads, and buildings. The project would also include\n            technical assistance, extension services, farm inputs and\n            equipment, and the creation of 15 villages. It would be\n            implemented by SONADER, a Government rural development\n            agency established in 1975 with IDA assistance. The project\n            would form a nucleus of development in the southeastern part\n            of the country, with an estimated three-fold increase in the\n            present US$50 per capita income derived from agriculture.
