The project\n            achieved its physical objectives, and in the case of small\n            hydro power and wind farms components, exceeded its targets.\n            The project's institutional development impact is rated\n            modest. Renewable Resources Development Project (RRDP)\n            strengthened Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency\n            (IREDA) and enabled it to mobilize greater private\n            participation and attract additional multilateral and\n            bilateral support for commercializing renewables. The\n            sustainability of RRDP is rated likely, but only marginally\n            so. There are high risks, as commercialization of renewables\n            continues to be threatened by regulatory instability, and\n            have many constraints, notably its continued dependence on\n            incentives, grants, and subsidies. IREDA itself continues to\n            face important financial issues that threaten the\n            sustainability of the project's achievement. Overall,\n            the Bank's performance is rated satisfactory, at least\n            at the project level. As explained in the remainder of this\n            PPAR, the main risks to the project stem from the lack of an\n            integrated renewables and power sector strategy. Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory. However, during project\n            implementation, project supervision records show that the\n            government was weak in supporting the rationalization of\n            lending rates, and in coordinating various agencies involved\n            with renewable energy development. The main lessons from\n            this evaluation are as follows: Power sector reforms and\n            renewable energy commercialization should be part of an\n            integrated strategy. The Bank and its client countries\n            should incorporate provisions to level the playing field\n            between conventional and renewable energy technologies while\n            legal/regulatory and other sector-level reforms are being\n            designed and implemented. Monitoring and evaluation systems\n            should be developed for both project and sector-level\n            outcomes, which should distinguish between efficiency and\n            equity indicators. GEF and other grant support operate in a\n            power sector reform setting, and thus should also be keyed\n            to sector outcome indicators. Much\n            \"learning-by-doing\" is involved in\n            non-conventional projects such as renewable energy\n            development and commercialization, which underlines once\n            more the importance o f monitoring and evaluation systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Renewable Resources Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Renewable Resources\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/10/2696348/india-renewable-resources-development-project","projn":"IN-Renewable Resources -- P010410","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Rural Energy,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy Conservation & Efficiency,Montreal Protocol","teratopic":"Energy","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20031112143800"},"subsc":"Renewable energy","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acceptable limits,alternative\n            energy,carbon,carbon dioxide,coal,coal\n            reserves,cogeneration,conventional energy,Electric\n            Power,Electric Power Sector,electricity,Electricity\n            Boards,electricity demand,electricity needs,electricity\n            supply,emissions,energy capacity,energy components,energy\n            crisis,energy policies,energy policy,energy problems,energy\n            resource,energy sector,energy systems,energy\n            technology,forest resources,fossil fuels,fuels,GEF,Global\n            Environment,Global Environment Facility,grid,hydro\n            power,hydro resources,natural resources,nonconventional\n            energy,photovoltaics,power,power generation,power generation\n            capacity,power plant,power sector reform,renewable\n            energy,renewable energy development,Renewable Energy\n            Development Agency,renewable energy projects,renewable\n            energy sources,renewable energy technologies,Renewable\n            Resources,renewable technology,renewables,Rural\n            Electrification,Rural Electrification Corporation,rural\n            energy,rural markets,solar home systems,solar\n            thermal,stoves,sustainable use,wind energy,wind turbines"},"1":{"cdata!":"acceptable limits,alternative\n            energy,carbon,carbon dioxide,coal,coal\n            reserves,cogeneration,conventional energy,Electric\n            Power,Electric Power Sector,electricity,Electricity\n            Boards,electricity demand,electricity needs,electricity\n            supply,emissions,energy capacity,energy components,energy\n            crisis,energy policies,energy policy,energy problems,energy\n            resource,energy sector,energy systems,energy\n            technology,forest resources,fossil fuels,fuels,GEF,Global\n            Environment,Global Environment Facility,grid,hydro\n            power,hydro resources,natural resources,nonconventional\n            energy,photovoltaics,power,power generation,power generation\n            capacity,power plant,power sector reform,renewable\n            energy,renewable energy development,Renewable Energy\n            Development Agency,renewable energy projects,renewable\n            energy sources,renewable energy technologies,Renewable\n            Resources,renewable technology,renewables,Rural\n            Electrification,Rural Electrification Corporation,rural\n            energy,rural markets,solar home systems,solar\n            thermal,stoves,sustainable use,wind energy,wind turbines"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020339-IREDA-INDIAN RENEWABLE\n            RESOURCES DEV.

The project goal was to\n            support private sector implementation of 85 MW of wind\n            farms, 100 MW of small hydro and 2.5 MW equivalents of\n            Photovoltaic (PV) systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Renewable Resources Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Renewable Resources\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2000/04/11293078/india-renewable-resources-development-project","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"approach, balance, capacity factor,\n            conventional Energy, crop, diesel, domestic lighting,\n            electricity, energy generation, energy intensive, energy\n            production, Energy Sector, energy service, energy service\n            companies, Energy Sources, environmental benefits,\n            generation, Global Environment, Global Environment Facility,\n            grid, grid power, hydro power, hydro projects, hydropower,\n            Income, independent power producers, kerosene, pipeline,\n            power plant, power plants, power producers, Power Program,\n            quality energy, Renewable Energy, Renewable Energy\n            Development, renewable energy equipment, renewable energy\n            industry, renewable energy program, renewable energy sector,\n            renewable energy technologies, Renewable Resources, rural\n            areas, small hydro, small hydro development, small\n            hydropower, solar lanterns, solar power, tax exemptions,\n            turbines, utilities, Village Cooperatives, water pumping,\n            water pumping systems, wind, wind energy, wind energy\n            sector, wind farm, wind farms, Wind Power, wind resources"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development","projn":"IN-Renewable Resources -- P010410","subtopic":"Power & Energy Conversion,Renewable Energy,Energy Production and Transportation,Carbon Policy and Trading,Energy and Environment","docty":"Viewpoint","teratopic":"Environment,Energy","entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20091102032839"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Renewable energy","theme":"Climate change,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Pollution management and environmental health","colti":"Viewpoint","historic_topic":"Environment,Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Energy & Extractives - GP (GEEDR)","trustfund":"TF020339-IREDA-INDIAN RENEWABLE\n            RESOURCES DEV.

The project achieved all of its major\n            objectives, institutional development has been partially\n            achieved, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            the Bank was satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            highly satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from\n            this project. First, a well-prepared project by an\n            experienced client will succeed if it contains all the basic\n            ingredients for a successful industrial project. Second, the\n            use of innovative and pioneering technology in developing\n            countries is a suitable basis for Bank financed projects\n            provided that the technology has been thoroughly researched.\n            Third, early agreement on model tender documents, in this\n            case by pre-appraisal stage, significantly facilitated\n            procurement processing, timely equipment delivery, and\n            disbursements. Fourth, the effort, commitment, and goodwill\n            invested by TNPL in preparing a resettlement and\n            rehabilitation action plan for the PAFs resulted in its\n            smooth and speedy implementation. Finally, to ensure their\n            long-term sustainability, technology innovations and\n            investments in state-of-the-art industrial machinery and\n            equipment should be accompanied by state-of-the-art\n            environmental and safety management systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Renewable Resources Development\n            Project : Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers Limited Papermill\n            Expansion Component"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Renewable Resources\n            Development Project : Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers\n            Limited Papermill Expansion Component"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/05/733537/india-renewable-resources-development-project-tamil-nadu-newsprint-papers-limited-papermill-expansion-component","projn":"IN-Renewable Resources -- P010410","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Water and Industry,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961214135100"},"subsc":"Renewable energy","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"activated sludge,alcohol,business\n            community,chlorine,coal,construction,cost\n            control,crops,drinking water,Economic Analysis,effluent\n            treatment,employment,energy\n            consumption,environmental,Environmental\n            hazards,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Management,environmental\n            protection,environmental regulations,environmental\n            sustainability,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,externalities,Families,farmers,feasibility\n            studies,Financial management,fossil\n            fuels,Gender,goodwill,health,health\n            services,housing,imports,In-house design,industrial\n            safety,innovation,irrigation canals,labor\n            costs,managers,NGOs,paper industry,Pollution,Pollution\n            Control,private sector,procurement,producers,Project\n            Management,public health,Public Sector,recycling,Renewable\n            Resources,reporting,safety,safety\n            equipment,savings,selling,sugar industry,surface water,waste,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"activated sludge,alcohol,business\n            community,chlorine,coal,construction,cost\n            control,crops,drinking water,Economic Analysis,effluent\n            treatment,employment,energy\n            consumption,environmental,Environmental\n            hazards,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Management,environmental\n            protection,environmental regulations,environmental\n            sustainability,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,externalities,Families,farmers,feasibility\n            studies,Financial management,fossil\n            fuels,Gender,goodwill,health,health\n            services,housing,imports,In-house design,industrial\n            safety,innovation,irrigation canals,labor\n            costs,managers,NGOs,paper industry,Pollution,Pollution\n            Control,private sector,procurement,producers,Project\n            Management,public health,Public Sector,recycling,Renewable\n            Resources,reporting,safety,safety\n            equipment,savings,selling,sugar industry,surface water,waste,wood"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
