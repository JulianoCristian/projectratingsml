lessons learned included: 1) A clear roadmap to achieve\n            the final objective of the Borrower and of the Bank support\n            should be developed and be the basis to design the specific\n            interventions and facilitate their development; 2) The\n            decision to decentralize Rural Electrification to the final\n            implementing agencies proved to be efficient and effective\n            to successfully implement the project and exceed the number\n            of communes and households electrified; 3) Rural\n            electrification projects have a low financial rate of return\n            and should be designed to give the room and stimulate the\n            mobilization of funding from other sources; 4) Consultation\n            and obtaining strong local commitments are essential in\n            projects involving a large numbers of parties; 5) The\n            project had a large numbers of sub-components, to be\n            implemented in difficult areas during a long period of time.\n            Flexibility is essential, both in term of physical scope and\n            approval, to allow for fast adjustment to unexpected\n            conditions (and in this case cost savings) that may arise in\n            implementation and increase the benefit of the project; and\n            6) Projects with local implementing agencies and/or covering\n            several local areas need a TTL and team based in the field\n            to actively and effectively coordinate and inter-act with\n            the

Following\n            a review of the legal, and administrative arrangements, it\n            assesses the analysis of alternatives for the installation\n            of transmission lines (TL), and for substations location, to\n            minimize environmental, and resettlement impacts. Taking\n            into account the Environmental Law, the project design\n            avoids dense forest areas, and preferably selects forest\n            areas of low economic, and ecological value, for both\n            temporary access roads, and installation of TLs. Surveys\n            revealed there are no cultural, or archaeological sites\n            along the project area; however, if local sites are\n            discovered, authorities from the Electricity of Vietnam\n            (EVN) shall notify local authorities. Nonetheless, during\n            construction, environmental concerns feature vegetation\n            clearance, soil erosion due to excavations for temporary\n            access road construction, and due to equipment/material\n            transportation. Measures to mitigate adverse impacts include\n            the installation of retaining fences to prevent slope\n            erosion, followed by vegetation, and tree planting to avoid\n            soil erosion. In such cases where slopes, or swamps cannot\n            be avoided for the installation of poles, pole-footings will\n            be redesigned to suit ground conditions. Hunting, and lumber\n            activities will be strictly forbidden, in compliance with\n            the Forestry Control Branch regulations.
