The Pilot Private Irrigation Project (PPIP)\n            had a highly satisfactory outcome; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; and both Bank and Borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. The Natural Resources\n            Management Project (NRMP) had a satisfactory outcome, risk\n            to the development outcome was moderate; and satisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.

Export development needs to follow a well defined\n            strategy, and a commodity chain approach needs to emphasize\n            producer-exporter linkages.

The key lessons learned\n            include: 1) Implementation of the PPIP demonstrated that a\n            private structure such as Niger Private Irrigation Promotion\n            Association can be a competent and efficient manager of a\n            development project financed with public resources and that\n            Niger's private sector has the skills and capabilities\n            to successfully organize and manage complex rural\n            development programs providing the Government willingness to\n            play its facilitating role. 2) The project experience shows\n            that small scale mechanized and improved manual irrigation\n            in Niger are an efficient tools for increasing food\n            security, profitability and incomes and poverty reduction in\n            rural areas. 3) Well targeted publicity can play a decisive\n            role in technologies promotion and a steady increase in\n            their adoption by farmers even among population with a low\n            literacy rate. 4) The improved or newly introduced\n            technologies and the saving and credit unions were\n            introduced by the project exclusively using free market,\n            private sector driven initiatives. 5) One of the\n            project's greatest contributions to development impact\n            was through its flexibility, recognizing that promoting\n            private approach in rural development is a slow and complex process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Pilot Private Irrigation
