Several lessons are drawn from the\n            experience of this project, above all, that decentralization\n            created a plethora of agencies with transport planning and\n            environmental management responsibilities; yet, a lack of\n            clarity remains within each agency regarding roles and\n            responsibilities with respect to transport planning.\n            Furthermore, the present institutional structure is\n            over-fragmented geographically, vertically and horizontally,\n            with insufficiently strong conduits for inter-agency\n            communication. One of the main constraints on a coordinated\n            approach to regional transport sector planning was the law\n            on regional autonomy. The law itself does not set out the\n            role, function and responsibility of each organization, nor,\n            the structure and staffing of a planning organization, nor,\n            the qualifications and experience for the personnel of the\n            organization. Thus, there needs to be a fully coordinated\n            institutional review of the transport sector to rationalize\n            the tasks of supply, financing and regulation. Regarding\n            road planning competency, it is good at the central level.\n            However, the principle tool employed - the inter-urban road\n            management system (IRMS), is complex and demands a large\n            volume of data. If the database is not maintained, the\n            output of IRMS is undermined in reliability, and therefore\n            often distrusted. Respect for road planning, programming and\n            budgeting activity by district level decision makers is\n            minimal. Consequently planning initiatives are few and\n            capability remains weak. Further lessons address transport\n            planning incentives, the importance of transport planning\n            groups, the role of lending institutions, and the need for\n            planning tools, in addition to an appropriate use of\n            consultants, and, road traffic safety and dimensions enforcement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

The\n            report notes that assessing the serious impacts road\n            construction will cause has been constrained by the dictates\n            of official government guidelines (hence recommendations for\n            environmental mitigations reported here are considered\n            faulty). Routine negative impacts generally specific to road\n            construction include the following: 1) riverbed or coastal\n            erosion; 2) noise and dust pollution, contamination of the\n            drinking water supply, and disruption to indigenous\n            communities; and 3) indirect impacts associated with\n            increased accessibility, such as harvesting of forest\n            products. Potential project-specific impacts include: 1)\n            increased potential for erosion and landslides; 2) the\n            downstream changes in the hydrological regime resulting from\n            forest clearance; 3) increased access for exploiting natural\n            resources, such as illegal logging and firewood collection\n            in protected forests, and illegal hunting of endangered and\n            protected wildlife; land clearing for unsustainable forms of\n            agriculture, and uncontrolled encroachment into protected\n            areas; 4) increased damage to fragile ecological habitats;\n            and habitat fragmentation caused by the road barrier; and 5)\n            displacement and relocation, and disruption particularly\n            affecting indigenous and isolated communities. In the case\n            of biological impacts, careful screening is planned to\n            ensure that the direct loss of flora and fauna will be\n            limited to that caused by land clearing. Impacts on the\n            biological composition of water bodies will be mitigated by\n            implementing technical guidelines, such as using culverts,\n            avoiding pollution, etc. More significant and indirect\n            impacts predicted to occur, from improved access into forest\n            areas, for example, will be mitigated by environmental\n            management and monitoring plans as covered, for the most\n            part, under Indonesia s environmental legislation. To\n            control erosion, retaining walls will be erected, although\n            these reportedly will very likely create scars in the\n            national park. To reduce disturbance to the fauna and flora\n            during construction, working hours will be controlled, and\n            the space required by the road limited. To reduce damage to\n            the national park, proposed mitigation measures include a\n            buffer zone of cultivated trees on both sides of the road;\n            strict supervision of park visitors; guard posts at the park\n            entrance and centrally to control illegal logging or land\n            clearance (or wildlife capture); and developing economic\n            facilities in the surrounding communities to reduce the need\n            to find work opportunities in the forest. The assessment\n            concludes that these measures are unlikely to prevent\n            serious damage to the watershed, the forest, or to the\n            national park; therefore strong environmental grounds exist\n            to reject any recommendations to construct new roads in\n            mountain forests, until there is the institutional capacity\n            to ensure that mitigation measures can be effectively\n            implemented, and no further damage occur."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Northern Sumatra Region Road\n            Project : environmental and social impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Northern Sumatra\n            Region Road Project : environmental and social impact assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/07/441320/indonesia-northern-sumatra-region-road-project-environmental-social-impact-assessment","projn":"ID-Sumatra Region Roads Project -- P003993","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Roads & Highways,Urban Services to the Poor,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development","count":"Indonesia","authors":{"authr":"Carl Bro International a/s in association\n            with PT.
