The key lesson learned is the need to carry\n            out upfront and in-depth institutional, organizational and\n            legal analysis and human resources assessments to ascertain\n            if existing irrigation institutions can really be\n            transformed as functioning water resources management\n            institutions. A second lesson is,  in an uncertain policy or\n            legislative environment, caused either by a lack of\n            commitment or political turmoil, it is important to focus on\n            implementing practical pilot and demonstration activities\n            that not only support intensified policy dialogue but give\n            opportunity to the concerned agencies and staff to learn and\n            to test on ground what is being debated on academic and\n            conceptual platforms. Third, as this project amply\n            demonstrates, when the project requires an agency and its\n            staff to take on new unprecedented roles and functions,\n            selective and effective technical assistance is essential\n            for training, capacity building, and step-by-step guidance\n            in early pilot activities blending global best practices\n            into the specific country situation. Though training courses\n            abound, there is no substitute for knowledgeable advisor(s)\n            who are in position to train, guide and encourage. Fourth,\n            when a project aims to change an agency's mandate, role\n            and functions, it is essential that an internal change\n            management process be initiated as soon as possible, perhaps\n            as early as before project appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
