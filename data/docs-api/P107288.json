Some lessons learned includes:\n            despite a being stand-alone operation, such a Development\n            Policy Operation (DPO) can have a significant development\n            impact particularly if it is following-up on a series of\n            prior DPOs and other Bank operations, and even more so if in\n            turn it is followed by DPOs and other operations, which\n            deepen the actions undertaken under the stand-alone DPO by\n            building on the reform momentum helped create. Public\n            Finance Management (PFM) modernization measures included in\n            the PFSC provided a solid basis and impetus for further\n            reforms; but those are likely not be fully achieved unless\n            the government is fully committed to implement such a long\n            term action plan, and if possible with further donors\n            support. Having a multi-sectoral group of Bank staff which\n            worked as real team very closely together across sector\n            boundaries, allowed to produce rapidly a coherent\n            multi-sectoral operation in which the different measures for\n            the different policy areas jibed well. Without proper\n            oversight, public agencies and other parastatals can rapidly\n            become poorly performing entities, run into a difficult\n            financial situation and cause significant fiscal burden on\n            the state. The stance taken by Bank country teams in a\n            number of countries that systemic privatization and/or\n            liquidation of parastatals will basically solve the problems\n            of performance of these entities, has often proven to be unrealistic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Public Finance Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Public Finance

Senegal operation aims to support the\n            authorities' efforts to bring their fiscal stance to a\n            sound and sustainable track, mitigate fiscal risks emanating\n            from public sector entities and protect critical\n            developmental objectives at a time when the authorities must\n            maintain a tight fiscal policy and cope with the impact of\n            the global crisis. Both the urgent need for financial\n            assistance in a highly uncertain global context and the\n            current focus of policy makers on fiscal issues make a\n            stand-alone operation a more appropriate instrument for Bank\n            support to the authorities at this juncture than a new\n            series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). This\n            approach will also provide time to the authorities for the\n            design and implementation of a medium-term reform agenda\n            that could be supported under the next series of PRSCs.\n            Policies and reforms supported by this operation are well\n            aligned with Senegal's poverty reduction strategy\n            paper. The operation is also fully consistent with the\n            objectives of the Bank's FY07-10 country assistance\n            strategy. The country is trying to emerge from its 2008\n            fiscal problems at a time of extraordinary stress in the\n            global environment. The major channels of transmission of\n            the global economic recession to the Senegalese economy are\n            exports, remittances, tourism, and foreign direct\n            investment. Being a very open economy, Senegal's\n            exposure to the global crisis is significant. However, the\n            already evident strength of the authorities' response\n            to their 2008 fiscal problems is turning out to provide a\n            critical boost that, together with a prudent macroeconomic\n            management going forward, should help Senegal weather the\n            global crisis, at least through 2009."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Public Finance Support
