Oil and lubricant spills will be\n            collected, and disposed of in selected landfills. To this\n            end, dump sites quarries, and mixing plants will be located\n            beyond residential areas. Construction material will be\n            transported in covered vehicles, and sites will be sprayed\n            in order to minimize dust emissions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Third Jiangxi Highway\n            Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 2) : Environmental\n            management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/01/6619958/china-third-jiangxi-highway-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-environmental-management-plan","projn":"CN-Third Jiangxi Highway Project -- P093906","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Roads & Highways,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"China"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060224185149"},"subsc":"Roads and highways","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absorption, afforestation, Air Pollution,\n            air quality, animals, asphalt, automobile, blasting, bridge,\n            bridge construction, bridges, catchment, cement, certain\n            extent, concrete, concrete mixing, construction,\n            construction sites, construction stage, county roads,\n            cultivated lands, culverts, Disinfection, ditches, drainage,\n            drainage system, drinking water, dust, economic development,\n            embankment, embankments, Environmental, Environmental impact\n            assessment, Environmental impacts, Environmental Management,\n            Environmental monitoring, environmental problem,\n            environmental problems, Environmental protection,\n            environmental quality, excavation, Flood Control, Forestry,\n            fuel, garbage, gas, Highway, Highway Project, Highway\n            Research, indigenous plants, interchanges, irrigation, land\n            acquisition, land reclamation, mining, national roads,\n            natural resources, Noise, Noise Pollution, oil, oils,\n            overpasses, oxidation, parking, pavement, paving, pH, pH\n            value, Pollution, Pollution risk, pond, provincial roads,\n            Public participation, railways, reservoirs, retaining walls,\n            river course, river flow, river system, rivers, Road\n            Construction, road shoulder, road surface, runoff, rural\n            roads, Safety, sand, sealing, seepage, sewage, sewage\n            disposal, sewage treatment, silt, Site selection, slag,\n            slope stability, Soil Conservation, soil erosion, Solid\n            Waste, Solid waste management, Solid wastes, stone,\n            structural adjustment, Subgrade, surface water, tanks,\n            terrain, topography, topsoil, Traffic, traffic accidents,\n            traffic control, traffic noise, traffic safety, transport,\n            transportation, tree planting, trees, tunnel construction,\n            tunnels, use value, vegetation, vehicles, velocity, waste\n            disposal, waste management, waste water, wastewater, Water\n            Conservation, Water Pollution, water quality, Water\n            Resource, wind"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF030730-SWEDEN CTF - FY06 (GENERAL -\n            ALL COUNTRIES/SECTORS/THEMES),TF030781-SPANISH CTF - FY06 (CHINA,\n            PHILIPPINES, & VIETNAM/ALL SECTORS & THEMES)","repnb":"E1263"},"facets":{}}}
