Some lessons learned included: greater attention\n            is required early in the project cycle to resettlement\n            issues for a project's affected population. Involuntary\n            resettlement is an integral part of project design and\n            should be dealt with from the earliest stages of project\n            preparation. In this project, there is clear evidence of the\n            limited focus early on to the issue of resettlement, which\n            led to delays in project implementation, an excessive cost\n            overrun, and distrust on the part of the affected families.\n            The Bank has now institutionalized early assessments as well\n            as broader policies for involuntary resettlement, and the\n            Government also has placed resettlement planning at a more\n            prominent level in the country's dam planning. Quality\n            at entry is paramount for project success. Clearly evident\n            in this project is the lack of quality at entry: there was\n            passive involvement by borrower during project preparation,\n            in part due to limited capacity, indicating limited\n            commitment and ownership; the project's magnitude was\n            not consistent with institutional capacities. Resettlement\n            particularly lends itself to active participation of\n            borrower and stakeholders but with the underestimation of\n            the affected population, participation of the stakeholders\n            was not actively pursued at the early stages of the project.\n            Rigorous analysis of project risks is required at early\n            phases of the project cycle. The institutional framework and\n            external environment are critical to a project's\n            success. In this project, a greater degree of certainty has\n            been conveyed than is warranted, hence overly optimistic\n            objectives/targets. More rigorous analysis of risks, such as\n            the implementing and financial capacity of borrower; and the\n            economic, social and environmental risks associated with\n            resettlement, should have been undertaken."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Guavio Hydro Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Guavio Hydro Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/05/734947/colombia-guavio-hydro-power-project","projn":"CO-Guavio Hydropower -- P006770","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Business Environment,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Urban Housing","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961214141757"},"subsc":"(Historic)Electric power and other energy adjustment","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounting\n            services,accounts,accounts payable,administrative\n            costs,aggressiveness,bid documents,bridges,community\n            relations,Construction,contractors,crime,employment,families,financial\n            planning,framework,heavy equipment,housing,illiteracy,land\n            acquisition,police,private sector,public health,rate of\n            return,resettlement,rural population,safety,sales,service\n            roads,social\n            issues,structures,surfacing,transformers,transport,tunnels,urban\n            housing,urban housing stock,vehicles,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounting\n            services,accounts,accounts payable,administrative\n            costs,aggressiveness,bid documents,bridges,community\n            relations,Construction,contractors,crime,employment,families,financial\n            planning,framework,heavy equipment,housing,illiteracy,land\n            acquisition,police,private sector,public health,rate of\n            return,resettlement,rural population,safety,sales,service\n            roads,social\n            issues,structures,surfacing,transformers,transport,tunnels,urban\n            housing,urban housing stock,vehicles,workers"}},"owner":"Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela CMU (LCC4C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"15691"},"723409":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1981/05/723409/colombia-guavio-hydro-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1981/05/723409/colombia-guavio-hydro-power-project","new_url":"1981/05/723409/colombia-guavio-hydro-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/09/000178830_9810190237468/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/09/000178830_9810190237468/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2008","docdt":"1981-05-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2000-11-09T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Guavio Hydro Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Guavio hydropower plant will be the\n            largest hydroelectric facility yet constructed in Colombia.\n            In addition to increasing the supply of renewable energy,\n            the Guavio Hydro Power Project will provide 15% of the\n            electricity needed in Colombia by 1988, a substantial part\n            of which will be for the city of Bogota, and its environs.\n            The project consists of: (a) river diversion, dam and\n            spillway tunnels; (b) intake and diversion of the Chivor and\n            Batatas Rivers into the Guavio reservoir; (c) pressure\n            tunnel, underground powerhouse and transformer caverns, and\n            tailrace tunnel; and (d) a 230 kV step-up substation at the\n            site, two double-circuit 230 kV transmission lines to\n            Bogota, and four 230 kV line bays at the Bogota 230 kV ring.\n            The project further includes construction of EEEB's\n            load dispatch and telecommunications center, which will\n            function as a regional satellite of the national dispatch\n            center under constrution by ISA.
