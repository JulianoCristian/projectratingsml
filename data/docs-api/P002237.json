Lessons are summarized as follows.\n            In hindsight, it is recognized that the narrow focus on the\n            population control rationale in the original project design,\n            would have served better had the approach been on\n            people-centered health and welfare, bringing about effective\n            behavioral change. Nonetheless, authorities are now\n            re-thinking family planning approaches based on its\n            contribution to improved health and welfare of mothers and\n            children, rather than just for macro-demographic goals, a\n            comprehensive approach currently being adapted at the policy\n            level. In addition, while the restructuring of the project\n            addressed important issues that Rwanda faced during the\n            period of emergency reconstruction, greater attention should\n            have probably been given to demand-side issues: health\n            districts which put in place effective community financing\n            schemes, experienced an increase in utilization of health\n            services, highlighting the importance of complementing\n            capital investments, with demand side measures. Other\n            lessons suggest contracting production of communication\n            materials to the private sector; channeling funds for\n            HIV/AIDS activities and modalities of this type to community\n            groups, accompanied by capacity building; and, addressing\n            more comprehensively the issue of human resources needs, to\n            ensure sustained development in the health system, in\n            addition to maintaining a strong project management unit\n            staff, knowledgeable with Bank procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda -
