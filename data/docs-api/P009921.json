Key lessons address the\n            need for: 1) government agencies to avoid direct involvement\n            in commercial operations, rather, involve itself only in\n            regulatory aspects, provision of technical back-stopping,\n            and resolution of technical problems with wide implications\n            for the industry. Commercialization should be left to the\n            private sector, including assistance to beneficiaries\n            regarding procurement, management, marketing, and\n            operations; 2) complex project design, and back-up support\n            to reflect beneficiaries' abilities, i.e., the scope of\n            operation, engineering, and organizational requirements must\n            be within targeted beneficiaries; likewise, the intensity of\n            involvement of site management, must reflect the\n            beneficiaries' capabilities; 3) appropriate policies,\n            and regulations to guide aquaculture development, backed by\n            effective institutions, capable of addressing social,\n            technical, and environmental problems, such as displacing\n            existing fishermen, or users of the resource, disease\n            problems, or effluent disposal; 4) realistic sequencing of\n            project developments, outlining that in the absence of a\n            completed technical, and organizational design by the\n            proposed start-up date, the first two years of\n            implementation, should be dedicated to preparing target\n            beneficiaries, through pilot trials, and, completing all\n            engineering, and organizational plans; and, 5) institutional\n            capacity, backed by qualified, skilled staff to ensure\n            resolution of problems, and timely implementation.\n            Similarly, technical qualifications of Bank teams should\n            ensure comprehensive planning, and supervisory standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Shrimp and Fish Culture Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Shrimp and Fish Culture Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1490197/india-shrimp-fish-culture-project","projn":"IN-Shrimp & Fish Cultur -- P009921","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Coastal and Marine Resources,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Fishing Industry,Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0107240402588"},"subsc":"Animal production","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Aquaculture,breeding,Coastal\n            Engineering,cooperatives,crops,development works,Economic\n            Analysis,economic development,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,environmental impacts,Environmental\n            Management,environmental protection,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,extension,extension\n            services,Farmers,farms,feed,financial\n            management,fingerlings,Fish,Fish Culture,fish\n            production,Fisheries,fisheries development,fisheries\n            sector,fishing,fry,hatcheries,income,incomes,inland\n            fisheries,inland fishery,marketing,mercury,MOA,new\n            technologies,NGOs,poverty alleviation,poverty line,private\n            sector,productivity,quality assessment,rural\n            population,Shrimp,shrimp culture,topography,traditional\n            fishermen,water pollution,White Spot Disease,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Aquaculture,breeding,Coastal\n            Engineering,cooperatives,crops,development works,Economic\n            Analysis,economic development,employment,Environmental\n            Impact,environmental impacts,Environmental\n            Management,environmental protection,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,extension,extension\n            services,Farmers,farms,feed,financial\n            management,fingerlings,Fish,Fish Culture,fish\n            production,Fisheries,fisheries development,fisheries\n            sector,fishing,fry,hatcheries,income,incomes,inland\n            fisheries,inland fishery,marketing,mercury,MOA,new\n            technologies,NGOs,poverty alleviation,poverty line,private\n            sector,productivity,quality assessment,rural\n            population,Shrimp,shrimp culture,topography,traditional\n            fishermen,water pollution,White Spot Disease,working capital"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF027620-FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT,TF026530-TAGPE - ENVIR.

This project, implemented over a\n            seven year period, comprises: (a) a brackish water shrimp\n            component located in the states of West Bengal, Orissa, and\n            Andhra Pradesh, which would represent about 80% of the\n            project cost; (b) an inland fisheries component located in\n            West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar\n            Pradesh, which would represent about 8% of the project cost;\n            and (c) project management including environmental\n            management and training representing about 12% of project\n            cost. The shrimp component would be the more complex as it\n            would support the first real thrust to introduce the\n            technologically advanced semi-intensive shrimp culture\n            (compared to the traditional extensive culture) to India in\n            a large way. It would involve a development cost of almost\n            Rs 300,000 (US $11,000) per ha, and would require the close\n            coordination between shrimp production, hatcheries and feed.\n            However, its benefits would be significant both in terms of\n            foreign exchange earnings and income to the beneficiaries.\n            The inland fisheries component would require very little\n            infrastructural cost, and the provision of support equipment\n            and services. The technology is simple and is already well\n            known.

This project, implemented over a\n            seven year period, comprises: (a) a brackish water shrimp\n            component located in the states of West Bengal, Orissa, and\n            Andhra Pradesh, which would represent about 80% of the\n            project cost; (b) an inland fisheries component located in\n            West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar\n            Pradesh, which would represent about 8% of the project cost;\n            and (c) project management including environmental\n            management and training representing about 12% of project\n            cost.
