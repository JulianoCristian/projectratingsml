Some lessons\n            learned included: Even if all prior actions are met,\n            especially in the case of one-tranche operations where all\n            such actions are met before Board presentation, the number\n            and share of people living in poverty is not reduced. This\n            leads to three conclusions. First, welfare changes poor have\n            be analyzed, as there might be impacts not necessarily\n            reflected in a reduction in the poverty rate. Second, policy\n            measures supported by poverty reduction support credit\n            (PRSC) may take a longer time to reduce the number of poor\n            people than ex-post evaluations may not reveal. There should\n            be a better understanding of the timing and mechanisms\n            through which these policies affect the poor. In some cases,\n            these policies lay the ground for growth to affect poverty,\n            although by themselves they may not have a direct and\n            immediate effect on the poverty rate. Lastly, policy actions\n            may not have been relevant to reduce poverty. Since it is\n            Bank policy to support Government-designed poverty reduction\n            strategy paper (PRSP), the analysis of these should be\n            reinforced to highlight those policies that, in the\n            Bank's view, will have a higher probability of\n            impacting poverty rates. Close and real coordination with\n            other development assistance partners is essential to the\n            success and continuity of policy-based lending, as it\n            provides the necessary financial and political leverage.\n            Single tranche operations, wherein all prior actions are\n            accomplished before Board presentation, have less\n            operational difficulties and provide the right incentives to\n            the borrower, by rewarding for self-determined and\n            self-decided actions, rather than buying policy reforms that\n            can always be reversed subsequently. Ideally, these should\n            be yearly operations. From the borrower's perspective,\n            this also allows closer coordination with the national\n            budget cycle and more predictability of financial\n            assistance. Accordingly, the amount of the operation needs\n            to be commensurate with its one-tranche design, as well as\n            the timing of intended development objectives. For this to\n            be possible, the Bank needs to assign sufficient\n            administrative resources for project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Poverty Reduction Support

A poverty reduction strategy, prepared\n            through a broad participatory process, identified main focus\n            areas for the country's development including better\n            governance, broad-based growth, and improved health and\n            education status of Nicaraguans. The goal of the first\n            poverty reduction support credit (PRSC), one of a series of\n            budget support operations, was to support the implementation\n            of this national strategy.

The Credit provided support in\n            four areas: a) macroeconomic stability and protection of\n            poverty expenditure; b) public institutions and governance;\n            c) human capital of the poor and vulnerable populations;\n            and, d) broad-based growth. Nicaragua made satisfactory\n            progress in maintaining a macro-economic framework, and in\n            carrying out the Strategy, and, there has also been\n            satisfactory progress in respect of the key results\n            envisaged in this Credit. Section II discusses the\n            macroeconomic situation, Section III assesses progress with\n            respect to the Poverty Reduction Strategy, and Section IV\n            provides an evaluation of the completion of the nine\n            specific actions. Given the delay in the completion of the\n            registration does not adversely affect the implementation of\n            the overall program supported by the PRSC series, or its\n            components, it is proposed that a waiver be granted.\n            Nevertheless, in order to reflect this delay, the amount of\n            the disbursement would be reduced by SDR 3.5 million (as per\n            the Borrower's cancellation of said amount pursuant to\n            Section 6.01 of the relevant General Conditions). In\n            consultation with the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit,\n            FODIEN - Development Fund for the Electricity Industry - has\n            been restructured through:1) the necessary modifications of\n            FODIEN's legal structure based on an evaluation of such\n            structure; 2) the entry into effect of rules and procedures\n            for selection, implementation and monitoring of subprojects\n            supported by FODIEN; 3) the establishment of funding,\n            financing mechanisms and subsidy allocation criteria for\n            subprojects; 4) the entry into effect of rules and\n            procedures for FODIEN's management; and, 5) the\n            adoption of a medium term financing plan of FODIEN,\n            consistent

      impact of reforms which have a potential for fiscal\n            destabilization, including pension reform and fiscal\n            transfers to municipalities. The series of PRSCs will\n            support the following subject areas contained in the four\n            pillars of the PRSP, with PRSC I emphasizing the first one :\n            Building Public Institutions and Governance (Pillar IV), is\n            a key factor in the reduction of corruption and the\n            achievement of the necessary fiduciary safeguards for\n            policy-based lending that would allow more poverty reducing\n            assistance. The following key areas will be supported by the\n            PRSC: civil service, public investment program and medium\n            term expenditure framework, public sector financial\n            management, public procurement, civic engagement,\n            decentralization and poverty analysis.  The PRSC will\n            support the Government's efforts to promote better\n            coordination and an effective use of resources, as well as a\n            series of reforms in basic education, health, population,\n            social protection and water and sanitation. I) The PRSC\n            would also support improvements in the investment climate,\n            competition policy, access to land and credit, agriculture\n            and forestry, and access and quality of infrastructure. The\n            proposed operation would contribute to Nicaragua's\n            poverty reduction efforts by: (a) increasing the\n            accountability, responsiveness and effectiveness of the\n            state, (b) directly supporting the achievement of PRSP\n            social goals and MDGs including targets for primary school\n            completion, improved child health and nutrition, improved\n            water coverage, and improved reproductive and maternal\n            health care for women, (c) helping to maintain a stable\n            macroeconomic framework, (d) improving the country's\n            investment climate, better positioning the country to\n            benefit from the Central American Free Trade Agreement\n            (CAFTA) and regional economic integration initiatives and\n            (e) fostering improved donor coordination--a key ingredient\n            for increasing the efficiency of aid- by fostering\n            sector-wide approaches and strengthening the\n            Government's fiduciary processes as the basis for\n            harmonized assistance from different external partners.\n            Political divisions between the Executive and the Nicaraguan\n            National Assembly constitute the biggest source of risk for\n            the PRSC. A second source o f risks is related to fiscal\n            instability associated with the passage of the Fiscal\n            Transfers Law and with pension reform.
