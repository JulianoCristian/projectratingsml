Some lessons learned includes: the\n            project confirms the effectiveness of non-traditional\n            structures to deliver social services in countries with weak\n            governmental capacity. A project implementation unit, such\n            as the Fonds d'Appui au Developpement Communautaire\n            (FADC), can successfully deliver social services to\n            populations that will otherwise be left underserved by\n            traditional state structures. Financing mechanisms and\n            intensive community training for the maintenance of\n            community-driven infrastructure development need to be\n            included in sub-project design. The cash-for-work activities\n            introduced under the SSP could provide a framework through\n            which to begin a broader dialogue on social protection with\n            the Government. The FADC is perceived among some\n            stakeholders as primarily an organization that constructs\n            social infrastructures. In low capacity contexts where\n            funding resources are limited, development programming could\n            leverage synergies between donors and implementing agencies.\n            Comoros provides a relatively successful case of donor\n            coordination, with different organizations acting as lead\n            agencies across the social sectors; however, exploiting\n            synergies between projects would help amplify their impacts.\n            Projects in low capacity contexts require intensive\n            supervision. The FADC made steady progress toward the SSP\n            Project Development Objectives (PDOs) throughout Project\n            implementation; however, serious mismanagement challenges\n            arose that required intensive World Bank supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Services Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comoros - Services Support

Mitigation\n            measures are suggested as follows. To prevent soil erosion,\n            landslides, contamination from wastes, and from excavation,\n            construction works should be implemented during the dry\n            season, protective fences should be installed on site\n            perimeters, surface areas and materials regularly sprayed,\n            adequate waste disposal, including chemicals and hazardous\n            materials, should be practices. Water resources conservation\n            practices should focus on drainage maintenance, alternative\n            alignments and retention ponds to prevent soil erosion; a\n            safe distance from wells, and sewage systems for latrines\n            sites. Construction schedules shall be restricted to limited\n            hours to prevent noise disturbances. Loss of natural\n            vegetation should be minimized, through alternative site\n            selection as possible, and re-vegetative practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Services Support Credit Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comores \u2013 Projet de cr\u00e9dit\n            d\u2019assistance aux services : \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/10/2826782/comoros-services-support-credit-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"KM-Service Support Credit -- P084315","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Urban Services to the Poor,Drylands & Desertification,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Comoros","authors":{"authr":"Kothari;
