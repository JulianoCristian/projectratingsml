Some lessons learned included:\n            the use of an effective project management structure for\n            piloting innovative approaches. In this case, the\n            semi-autonomous structure of the SDF agency balanced with\n            its placement in the social development ministry and\n            overseen by a multi-sectoral Board allowed for the\n            establishment of a high caliber team and integration with\n            broader poverty reduction and sectoral policies. This\n            ability to adapt was critical in developing more cost\n            effective capacity building strategies and in capturing\n            opportunities in the poverty monitoring component, like\n            funding Senegal's development gateway. Building on the\n            strengths of civic engagement and civil society to overcome\n            capacity constraints on the public sector side in reaching\n            the poorest communities and in developing ownership and\n            self-help spirit that drove positive outcomes at the\n            community level. An emphasis on capacity building and\n            communications as an integral part of community investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Social Development Fund

their development resources, and,\n            economic, and social services, based on the following\n            project components. 1) Communities, in particular vulnerable\n            groups, will have improved access to basic social services,\n            and infrastructure, through sustainable processes. From the\n            demand perspective, the component will support subprojects\n            aiming at developing structures that improve access to basic\n            social services by the community, such as a micro-project\n            promoting the use of technology to preserve milk, enabling\n            its transportation for market sale. On the supply side, the\n            aim is to attract social services providers, such as funding\n            a micro-project for the promotion of a youth-run\n            Information/Education/Communication campaign. The objectives\n            will be phased by setting institutional arrangements,\n            monitoring and evaluation, and scaling up implementation\n            through communal participatory poverty assessments. 2) The\n            micro-finance component will extend financial services\n            focusing on social intermediation, facilitating the creation\n            of savings and credit associations. 3) The capacity building\n            component will organize the most vulnerable groups, through\n            an institutional development phase to set up their\n            operational capacity, financial, and project management\n            abilities. 4) A baseline data and information system will be\n            developed to trace poverty alleviation programs for\n            executing agencies, social fund Boards, Ministries, and\n            donors, and, institutional systems will be created for\n            integration of social funds, within community-based
