The Bank\n            received a satisfactory rating for their performance while\n            the Borrower received a highly satisfactory performance\n            rating. There were several restructuring this project went\n            through, five in total. The result of each restructuring was\n            an extension of the closing date. The first restructuring\n            was to address a financing gap arising from unanticipated\n            circumstances, and to scale up project activities. The\n            second procurement was due to delays in procurement\n            processes required an extension of the closing date to allow\n            for the full disbursement of the technical assistance\n            component. The third restructuring provided an extension to\n            allow for the implementation of two consultancies (a\n            feasibility study on a train network and an Economic Master\n            Plan for the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area) in the\n            technical assistance component. The fourth restructuring\n            extended to closing date to be able to use remaining funds\n            under the TA component to extend the scope of the Economic\n            Master Plan consultancy by including 14 additional\n            municipalities in the study. The final restructuring\n            extended to closing date due to delays in approving the\n            procurement of the last contract (Economic Master Plan\n            consultancy). Several lessons were taken from this project\n            including the following: (1) the importance of a technical\n            assistance component to foster innovation, (2) the\n            value-added through technical assistance provided by the\n            Bank, (3) the importance of technical assistance as a\n            vehicle for continued dialogue, (4) disbursement-linked\n            indicators as a performance push, (5) attention needs to be\n            given to the design of the DLIs, and (6) the financing of\n            eligible expenditure programs (EEPs) can serve to protect\n            certain categories of spending in certain sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Minas Gerais Development\n            Partnership

The\n            extension of nineteen months, from March 31st, 2012 till\n            October 31st, 2013, is consistent with the OP13.20\n            requirement that the additional loan closes within three\n            years of the closing date of the original loan that is in\n            effect when the additional loan is approved, which is March\n            31, 2012 given that a restructuring and extension of the\n            original loan was approved by the Board simultaneously with\n            the approval of the additional financing. As confirmed with\n            LCSDE, since the extension is below twenty four months from\n            the current project closing date, as approved by the Board\n            at the time of the approval of the additional financing.
