Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) Visible successes are a key motivator\n            for change; demonstrate results with a few pilots first.\n            School-based management (SBM) was rapidly accepted by all\n            stakeholders, because it was tried and was successful in a\n            few schools on a piece-meal basis first; 2) Information\n            dissemination and capacity building play a significant role\n            in the successful implementation of decentralized systems\n            such as SBM; 3) Local empowerment for planning and\n            implementing locally developed plans, even with small\n            amounts of money, results in greater ownership and\n            transparency; 4) Accountability systems, with clear\n            performance criteria, are critical factors for effective and\n            efficient project implementation; 5) Readily available and\n            targeted technical assistance (for example, for school\n            building program as it was being done) is important in\n            achieving timely and quality outputs; 6) The credibility of\n            the results of any national assessments for students is\n            enhanced when its administration involves independent\n            examiners and monitors; 7) The presence of a legal or policy\n            cover to support new ways of doing business is essential for\n            experimentation; and 8) A focus on identifying problems and\n            seeking solutions as a coherent, collaborative Bank-client\n            team is important for achieving results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Third Elementary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Third Elementary\n            Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/7585508/philippines-third-elementary-education-project","projn":"PH-Third Elementary Education -- P004602","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Tertiary Education,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Education For All","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070504144634"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration,Primary education,Other social services","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement data, achievement indicators,\n            Achievement Tests, administrative data, age cohort, age\n            group, assessment framework, Basic Education, Basic\n            Education Sector, basic services, census data, civic\n            engagement, civil society, class teachers, classroom,\n            classrooms, cohort of students, community involvement,\n            completion rate, completion rates, curriculum, curriculum\n            materials, Decentralization, decentralized management,\n            demonstration, disadvantaged groups, dropout rates,\n            Education Development, Education Division, Education for\n            all, education indicators, Education Management, education\n            offices, education planning, education plans, education\n            reforms, education system, Educational Management,\n            educational materials, Educators, ELEMENTARY EDUCATION,\n            elementary school, Expenditures, gross enrollment, gross\n            enrollment rate, Human Development, In Service Training,\n            Instructional Materials, interventions, Leadership,\n            learning, learning achievement, learning achievements,\n            learning outcomes, local communities, local level, local\n            management, manuals, master teachers, mathematics, Mid-term\n            Review, multigrade schools, national assessment, NER, Net\n            Enrollment, Net Enrollment Ratio, number of schools, Pacific\n            Region, Parent-Teacher Associations, pedagogies, pedagogy,\n            Performance Indicators, Primary education, principals,\n            provision of textbooks, public schools, quality assurance,\n            quality of education, researchers, rural areas, satellite\n            schools, school building, school buildings, school children,\n            school construction, School Improvement, School Improvement\n            Plan, school level, school levels, school mapping, school\n            performance, school-age, school-age population, schools,\n            science teacher training, secondary schools, Service\n            Training, Sports, student achievement, student assessment,\n            student learning, supplementary materials, Teacher, teacher\n            competency, Teacher Education, Teacher Education Institutes,\n            teacher training, teachers, teaching, teaching force,\n            technical assistance, Tertiary education, test scores, textbook"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020185-GAMBIA - URBAN ENV.

While the intention of the law was\n            to end a government monopoly and open the textbook industry\n            to competition, the implementation of the law resulted in\n            the protection of a few suppliers of low quality and high\n            priced textbooks. A Bank-financed Third Elementary Education\n            Project had funds available for textbooks - but required\n            competitive bidding procedures. With the support of\n            high-ranking officials from DECS and the department of\n            budget and management, the project team was able to reach\n            agreement with DECS to purchase textbooks through\n            international competitive bidding. A total of 50 million\n            textbooks have been purchased so far under these two Bank\n            financed projects.

To achieve its\n            objective, the project will have a policy and institutional\n            framework (PIF) and two investment components.  The PIF\n            will: a) improve the adequacy, efficiency and equity of\n            sub-sector funding; b) ensure that basic inputs are\n            delivered; c) introduce systems and procedures to\n            decentralize selected education functions and corresponding\n            resources; d) measure the impact of project interventions on\n            cost and learning; and e) provide a framework for handling\n            resettlement issues.  The first investment component is\n            capacity building at the national and regional levels which\n            will: create a national structure for project management and\n            capacity strengthening; build capacities in support of\n            policy and decision making; and build capacities in support\n            of decentralized implementation and effective schools.  The\n            second investment component is educational improvement in 26\n            poor provinces.  This will: a) strengthen capacities in the\n            divisional offices, local government units and other TEEP\n            stakeholders; and b) develop and implement Divisional\n            Elementary Education Development Plans which will improve\n            learning, raise completion rates and expand access."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Third Elementary Education
