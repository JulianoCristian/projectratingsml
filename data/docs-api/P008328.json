The physical targets of\n            reconstruction were met - in many cases, exceeded\n            expectations - within the original cost estimates, except\n            for increases in amounts expended under specific components,\n            which were either due to reallocations from other\n            components, or to changes in composition of investment. The\n            key lessons suggest that complexity in emergency operations\n            may not need to be entirely avoided, as long as the Bank is\n            prepared to support the Borrower through proactive, and\n            staff-intensive involvement during project preparation, and\n            subsequently during implementation, ensuring adequate\n            technical assistance, and financing, either under the loan,\n            or preferably, through grant financing from donors. The Bank\n            should promptly respond to project preparation needs, to\n            avoid delays which can change the composition of assistance.\n            Changing circumstances, particularly in operations under\n            harsh political environments, call for adjustments within\n            components, thus requiring flexibility, and timeliness to\n            ensure an effective assistance. Since time is of the essence\n            in emergency operations, special attention should be given\n            to defining procurement arrangements, and capacity building,\n            thus a strong preparation would ease the burden of\n            correcting deficiencies in the subsequent supervision stages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Emergency Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Emergency\n            Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/05/728898/croatia-emergency-reconstruction-project","projn":"HR-Emergency Reconstruction Project -- P008328","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Health Economics & Finance,Urban Services to the Poor","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Croatia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00062905302422"},"subsc":"Housing finance,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Power,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"augmentation,coastal\n            areas,communities,Competitive Bidding,construction,cost\n            savings,Flood Control,grant\n            financing,households,housing,pipeline,primary health\n            care,pumping,Railways,Regional Development,Replacement of\n            water,river basin,Roads,sanitation,sanitation\n            facilities,schools,sewage treatment,Town,Urban\n            Development,Water Management,water pumping station,Water\n            Supply,water supply systems,water treatment,water treatment plant"},"1":{"cdata!":"augmentation,coastal\n            areas,communities,Competitive Bidding,construction,cost\n            savings,Flood Control,grant\n            financing,households,housing,pipeline,primary health\n            care,pumping,Railways,Regional Development,Replacement of\n            water,river basin,Roads,sanitation,sanitation\n            facilities,schools,sewage treatment,Town,Urban\n            Development,Water Management,water pumping station,Water\n            Supply,water supply systems,water treatment,water treatment plant"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF027980-SWISS CONSULTANT TRUST FUND FOR\n            EASTERN EUROPE AND THE CIS,TF036120-BOSNIA-HEZEGOVINA - EMERGENCY\n            LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT,TF031090-CROATIA/PROCUREMENT MANAGER,TF027099-PHRD-EASTERN SLAVONIA:EMERGENCY\n            RECONST.
