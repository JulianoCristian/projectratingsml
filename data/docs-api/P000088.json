There are four major lessons emerged from the\n            project: a) Strong government commitment and participation\n            in the design and implementation of a Public Enterprise (PE)\n            Reform Program is a sine qua non condition to the success of\n            reforms. b) In 1985-86, when the project was being prepared,\n            the approach to PE reform centered around restructuring and\n            strengthening PE management and financial performance, while\n            maintaining them in the State portfolio. In retrospect, the\n            Bank should have included privatization and private sector\n            participation in the project objectives instead of focusing\n            solely on rehabilitating viable PEs and liquidating\n            non-viable ones. c) An efficient project implementing agency\n            played a key role in the design and implementation of the\n            Divestiture Program. d) The inability of project funds to\n            cover the severance pay resulting from the liquidation of\n            PEs was one of the major causes of delays in closing\n            liquidations. e) Consensus building and public information\n            campaigns to seek support of stakeholders and civil society\n            should have been an integral part of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Public Enterprise Sector\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Public Enterprise Sector\n            Rehabilitation

This program will encourage private sector\n            participation and more careful screening of new public\n            undertakings to ensure their economic and financial\n            viability. At the enterprise level, (a) diagnostic studies\n            will be conducted for selected state-owned enterprises to\n            assess their potential viability, and liquidation plans will\n            be prepared for those enterprises found uneconomic.\n            Additionally, (b) rehabilitation will be undertaken in two\n            stages for those enterprises diagnosed as viable. In the\n            first stage of rehabilitation, an emergency program will be\n            implemented to arrest their further deterioration. In the\n            second stage, a full rehabilitation program setting specific\n            conditions for efficient and profitable operation, will be\n            carried out. To accomplish this, the project will comprise\n            technical assistance, a credit component for enterprise\n            rehabilitation, and financing of training and redeployment\n            of staff laid off."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Public Enterprise Sector\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Public Enterprise Sector\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/11/741311/benin-public-enterprise-sector-rehabilitation-project","projn":"BJ-Public Enterprises-114391 -- P000088","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Microfinance,Small Scale Enterprise,Municipal Financial Management,Private Participation in Infrastructure,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970723103127"},"subsc":"(Historic)Public enterprise reform","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,Accounting,accounting\n            standards,Auditing,auditors,autonomy,banking sector,Banking\n            System,bankruptcy,Banque Centrale des Etats de\n            l'Afrique de l'Ouest,Boards of Directors,Business\n            Taxes,capital\n            expenditures,capitalization,Company,Corporations,counsel,Debt,deposits,Expansion,Financial\n            data,Financial Performance,firms,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            banks,foreign exchange,illiquidity,legal\n            framework,legislation,Liquidation,Management Information\n            Systems,maturities,medium size enterprises,Mergers,mixed\n            enterprises,monetary policies,Net Losses,net working\n            capital,private\n            enterprises,privatization,profitability,Public Enterprise\n            Sector,Public Enterprises,public finance,public\n            services,public utilities,resource allocation,State\n            Enterprises,suppliers,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,Transport,wages,water supply,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,Accounting,accounting\n            standards,Auditing,auditors,autonomy,banking sector,Banking\n            System,bankruptcy,Banque Centrale des Etats de\n            l'Afrique de l'Ouest,Boards of Directors,Business\n            Taxes,capital\n            expenditures,capitalization,Company,Corporations,counsel,Debt,deposits,Expansion,Financial\n            data,Financial Performance,firms,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            banks,foreign exchange,illiquidity,legal\n            framework,legislation,Liquidation,Management Information\n            Systems,maturities,medium size enterprises,Mergers,mixed\n            enterprises,monetary policies,Net Losses,net working\n            capital,private\n            enterprises,privatization,profitability,Public Enterprise\n            Sector,Public Enterprises,public finance,public\n            services,public utilities,resource allocation,State\n            Enterprises,suppliers,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,Transport,wages,water supply,working capital"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF027880-PUBLIC ENTERPRISES SECTOR REHABILITAION","repnb":"5467"},"facets":{}}}
