Project sustainability is rated as likely\n            because the improvements in the business environment were\n            important and largely irreversible. World Bank performance\n            overall was satisfactory. Borrower performance overall was\n            unsatisfactory. The folowing lessons are derived from the\n            design and the implementation of the project: The\n            implementation arrangements shoudl ensure that there is an\n            entity formally responsible for project technical\n            cordination and monitoring that would be positioned to solve\n            problems in a timely manner. An integrated manual of\n            procedures for procurement and financial management helps a\n            project succeed. Procurement supervision should be carried\n            out by qualified staff or a procurement specialist who is\n            formally a part of the World Bank team. The executing\n            unit's capacity in areas such as procurement, financial\n            management, and disbursement, is critical to project\n            performance. Sustained commitment, flexibility, and\n            expeditious decisionmaking on the part of the government are\n            also critical for good project performance. Most\n            accomplishments under this project would not have been\n            achieved without the commitment of the Senegalese\n            authorities to improving the business environment. The\n            project's failures reflect government inaction in\n            certain areas. An output-based financing mechanism could be\n            effective in committing institutions to drive for results\n            and achieve their assigned performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -
