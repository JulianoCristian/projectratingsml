Some lessons learned included:\n            the experience in preparing and implementing the project\n            offers several lessons that could inform similar project\n            designs. Some of these lessons relate to factors that\n            impeded project implementation while others reflect factors\n            that supported implementation of the project in Ukraine. It\n            is impossible to anticipate fundamental changes in the\n            operating environment, such as the orange revolution at\n            appraisal. It is therefore important to use the flexibility\n            offered by a project restructuring to align project design\n            to changing realities. It is equally important to reflect\n            the impact of restructuring in the formal project\n            documentation. The modernization department that implemented\n            the project provided about 140 full time staff to support\n            the modernization efforts of the STS and by extension\n            project implementation. This specific feature of the\n            project's implementation arrangements had several\n            advantages. First, since the unit is staffed with civil\n            servants (as opposed to temporary, external consultants\n            hired with project funds) it increased project ownership,\n            established important project and change management\n            capacities within the Government, improved the transfer of\n            inputs developed by project to operational business units\n            within the STS while ensuring adequate staff resources were\n            dedicated to the modernization effort. Second, since the\n            department will be sustained beyond the life of the project\n            it not only enhances the sustainability of project\n            achievements, but also enables the STS to expand and deepen\n            its reform efforts and provide strong coordination among all\n            modernization activities independent of the source of financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - First State Tax Service (STS)\n            Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine - First State Tax Service\n            (STS)
