These are some of the general lessons learned\n            from the project:  1) The LIL (Learning and Innovation Loan)\n            instrument is a good instrument to test the acceleration of\n            implementing a policy reform on a small scale before\n            acquiring experience and factoring in the lessons for\n            replicating the positive results on a large-scale, both from\n            educational as well as financial perspectives.   2) Housing\n            the PCU in the Ministry of Education helps to foster\n            communication between the implementing agency and the\n            Ministry. The downside, however, is that the PCU could\n            become burdened with other bureaucratic requirements thereby\n            diffusing its attention to project implementation.\n            Mitigating measures need to be put in place during Project\n            preparation stage. 3) Mali's experience in using\n            bilingual education demonstrates that, in a multi-lingual\n            environment, a focus on few national languages can lead to\n            increased educational coverage and improvements in student\n            learning among a significant student population.\n            Project-specific lessons included: 1) The value of bilingual\n            education as a primary education strategy in multi-lingual\n            countries (which have both a national and several indigenous\n            languages) is that it improves school attendance, reduces\n            dropout rates, and has cumulative advantages for student\n            learning. However, this requires government's continued\n            commitment to an irreversible policy reform for using\n            bilingual education. 2) While there are initial costs of\n            introducing bilingual education, there are associated\n            benefits in terms of improved learning achievements.\n            Introducing bilingual education in a phased manner helps to\n            adjust central and local budgets for education. 3)\n            Information campaigns are needed to disseminate positive\n            results of a bilingual education policy, and shore up\n            support for the policy. Parents are perhaps one of the most\n            important links in information campaigns to raise social\n            awareness with respect to girls attending school. 4)\n            Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) requires careful\n            attention during project design and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -

          of the Malian educational system, especially its quality,\n            equity, and access to learning. There are four main project\n            components. The first implements bilingual education in\n            primary education by financing textbook and learning\n            material production and distribution; training teachers,\n            school directors, inspectors, and pedagogic advisors; and\n            evaluating student learning and teacher quality. The second\n            component finances training for school management\n            committees, adult literacy, and community awareness as well\n            as school improvement projects. The third component procures\n            consultants, develops workshops, and decentralizes financial\n            and management procedures. The fourth component strengthens\n            implementation capacity by financing technical assistance,\n            training , logistics, and equipment costs for project coordination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republique du Mali -
