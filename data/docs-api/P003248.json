Some lessons learned included:\n            despite the progress achieved, prevention of new HIV\n            infections at community level is still a challenge and\n            should receive priority for the next generation of\n            subprojects. Communities should be encouraged to improve\n            their understanding of the dynamics of a generalized\n            epidemic and the remedies needed to address it. Reducing the\n            incidence of HIV and AIDS is the ultimate goal and measure\n            of success in the fight against HIV and AIDS. This goal\n            should be on the radar screen of everyone involved in HIV\n            and AIDS work. However, the successful community\n            mobilization did not match with an effective referral system\n            to health facilities. Although the impact of the community\n            response was not built in the design, there are plans to\n            measure the effectiveness of the response with support from\n            the Bank and Department for International Development\n            (DFID). Mainstreaming HIV and AIDS in line ministries took\n            the form of a standard menu of interventions. Interaction\n            between ministries was enhanced through the planning\n            meetings. This opened avenues for sharing information and\n            lessons learnt in implementation of work place activities.\n            However, line ministries still need to work on external\n            mainstreaming and there is also an urgent need to strengthen\n            work place programs within the private sector especially\n            small business. Retention of trained youth volunteers at\n            youth friendly health centers is still a challenge. There is\n            a high turnover among youths running community youth\n            projects. Outreach activities where youth interacted with\n            adult health staff were less acceptable and less likely to\n            succeed than those where interaction was among youths\n            themselves. However, designated youth centers in places\n            where privacy and easy access was assured were more likely\n            to succeed than those established in crowded clinical settings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - National Response to HIV/AIDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - National Response to\n            HIV/AIDS
