Some\n            lessons learned included: designing a more comprehensive\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework: while the\n            project monitored the quality of services and operating\n            subsidy in accordance with the stated project development\n            objectives (PDOs), this M&E framework did not allow for\n            an assessment of the general benefit to public welfare or\n            the impact on the poor. It is recommended that projects with\n            similar objectives also monitor ridership classified by\n            income class and the affordability of services. The periodic\n            rehabilitation of existing trains can be a cost-effective\n            option if a system has spare operating capacity. However, it\n            can be unexpectedly costly and complicated if the\n            implementing agency does not have very specialized technical\n            and management capacity. It often takes longer and costs\n            more than planned because it is difficult to assess all of\n            the rehabilitation costs without disassembling the cars.\n            Also, rehabilitation does not allow for the easy\n            installation of some modern features including signaling,\n            telecommunications, air conditioning and energy-efficiency\n

of a fully integrated urban\n            transport system; and (b) to substantially improve the level\n            of service provided by the suburban railway while reducing\n            the operating subsidies from the State through the\n            substantial participation of the private sector in its\n            operations and management. The Project Development\n            Objectives (DOs) and Implementation Performance (IPS)\n            ratings of  the project  have been satisfactory and have\n            succeeded in improving the rail transit sub sector of the\n            RJMR, decreasing its burden on the State Treasury by\n            eliminating operating subsidies. The additional financing\n            requested by the State is being requested solely to cover a\n            portion of the financing gap due to the devaluation of the\n            US$ in relation to the Brazilian and Korean currencies. With\n            this additional financing loan and the counterpart funds,\n            all contracts will be completed as planned. The State has\n            assured the Bank that it will continue to provide the US$20M\n            in counterpart fund requirements, so that by the end of the\n            project the Bank will finance 67 percent of the project cost\n            instead of the original 50 percent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

The project\n            has two components: 1) an infrastructure and equipment\n            component that rehabilitates/refurbishes Flumitrens'\n            rolling stock and infrastructure and rehabilitates or builds\n            transfer stations between the trains and other modes (Metro,\n            buses, and ferries); and 2) an institutional and policy\n            development component that helps a) support the process of\n            concessioning Flumitrens to the private sector through\n            technical assistance for preparing and evaluating bids; b)\n            operate the Regional Transport Coordination Commission\n            (RTCC) for the RJMR; c) prepare an integrated Transport\n            Policy, Land Use, and Air Quality Management strategy for\n            the RJMR to meet both transport and air quality targets and\n            to introduce sound cost recovery, tariff, regulatory, and\n            subsidy policies; d) set up a comprehensive staff retraining\n            for Flumitrens; e) prepare feasibility studies and bidding\n            documents for a proposed extension and other priorities of\n            the mass transit system; and f)
