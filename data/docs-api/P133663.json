Some lessons learned included:\n            the breakdown of Malawi\u2019s public financial management (PFM)\n            that occurred in 2013 highlights the need for a thorough\n            understanding of the local political economy of reform and\n            the importance of looking beyond the veneer of formal\n            rules-based systems, to the underlying informal arrangements\n            that allowed for collusive behavior to take place.\n            Development policy financing can be seen as a two-edged\n            sword with the provision and then suspension of budget\n            support serving to amplify political and business cycles in\n            the economy. The Bank and other common approach to budget\n            support (CABS) donors are not currently disbursing DPOs3\n            policy dialogue on the issues continues and by keeping the\n            option of resuming budget support at a future date on the\n            table, there are positive incentives in support of critical\n            reforms. The most notable area of progress was on reforms to\n            fertilizer procurement under farm input subsidy program\n            (FISP), an area that lays at the core of Malawi\u2019s public\n            policy, where the introduction of a revised tonnage\n            allocation formula helped reduce costs and improve\n            allocative efficiency. DPOs can play an instrumental role\n            and as part of a mix of aid instruments by helping (at the\n            margin) to support critical reforms necessary for stronger\n            and more resilient growth and poverty reduction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Economic Recovery Development\n            Policy Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Economic
