Lessons learned\n            included: from project approval in 1995 until completion in\n            2007, the World Bank Task Manager and the Turkish Technology\n            Development Foundation (TTGV) Project Manager remained on\n            the project. This resulted in substantial continuity of\n            project knowledge, helped consensus building with officials\n            of pertinent government agencies, and an enhanced ability to\n            streamline project procedures. TTGV and Non- Governmental\n            Organization (NGO) possessed the technical and\n            administrative knowledge to manage PODS-II very effectively.\n            The agency's contacts with Small and Medium Enterprises\n            (SMEs) facilitated their promulgation of PODS requirements\n            and identification of potential grant/loan applicants. Their\n            experience in PODS-I was very helpful in understanding\n            project requirements and facilitating contact with relevant\n            Government of Turkey (GoT) agencies. Although Ministry of\n            Environment and Forestry (MoEF), Ministry of Agriculture and\n            Rural Affairs (MARA), and the Under secretariat of Customs\n            had collaborated during PODS-I, at the start of PODS-II\n            their efforts to coordinate and reach a policy consensus\n            with business on development of regulations and\n            implementation of the National Ozone Plan was\n            time-consuming. Through many interactions and meetings\n            during PODS-II, their contacts improved greatly and became\n            much more efficient."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Second Phase-Out of Ozone
