In the mid-1990s, the\n            agriculture sector in the delta accounted for nearly 30\n            percent of the country's gross domestic product and\n            more than 80 percent of the rice exports, helping to make\n            Vietnam one of the largest exporters of rice. In the\n            mid-upper part of the delta where freshwater is available\n            all year round, many areas were triple cropped. However, in\n            the lower delta growth options were severely constrained by\n            sea-water intrusion into agricultural areas, further\n            reducing the availability of freshwater in the dry season,\n            and by annual inundation and flooding due to poor drainage.\n            This contributed to hard living conditions, with farmers in\n            some areas among the country's poorest people. Drinking\n            water supplies were often severely affected by salinity and\n            acidity. A key requirement in enhancing the productivity of\n            the agricultural sector and increasing the living standards\n            of the rural population, especially in the lower delta, was\n            to improve and rehabilitate water control infrastructure to\n            address salinity intrusion, irrigation, drainage, flood\n            protection, and drinking water supply."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Innovations in rural water supply and\n            irrigation : Vietnam's Mekong Delta Water Resources Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Innovations in rural water supply\n            and irrigation : Vietnam's Mekong Delta Water Resources Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/10/9984453/innovations-rural-water-supply-irrigation-vietnams-mekong-delta-water-resources-project","projn":"1W-Feature Stories -- P111132,VN-- Mekong Delta Water -- P004845","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Vietnam,World","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20081031000351"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Water supply,Sanitation,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific,The World Region,The World Region","colti":"Water feature stories ; issue no. 20","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Knowledge Management Product","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to safe drinking water, agricultural\n            production, aquaculture, brackish water, canals, capacity\n            for operation, clean water, climate change, construction,\n            covering, dikes, domestic water, domestic water supply,\n            drainage, Drinking water, Drinking water supplies, drinking\n            water supply, engineering, farmers, farming, flood\n            protection, flooding, floods, freshwater, investment costs,\n            Irrigation, irrigation systems, irrigation water, local\n            capacity, piped water, pumps, river basin, rural\n            communities, rural drinking water, Rural Water, Rural Water\n            Supply, safe drinking water, safe water, salinity,\n            sanitation, sanitation component, sanitation facilities,\n            sanitation investments, sea, sluice gates, sustainable\n            water, towns, water fees, Water Law, water management, water\n            quality, Water Resources, water resources development, water\n            resources management, water resources planning, Water\n            Sector, water service, water supplies, water supply systems,\n            water tariffs, wells"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR),Vietnam Sustainable Development (EASVS),Water Unit (TWIWA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF021659-SWISS GRANT TO WSP FOR E.

However, it did not\n            anticipate the magnitude of soaring land prices in the Delta\n            area which made this issue much more complex and the\n            resettlement process much more difficult during the course\n            of the project. The government knew as much as International\n            Development Association (IDA) did that timely release of\n            counterpart funds was a determinant factor for this project\n            but delays in the approval or release of resettlement funds\n            occurred due to bureaucratic factors, some of which were\n            beyond the control of the implementing ministry or even the\n            Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and Ministry of\n            Finance (MOF). It should be recognized that although these\n            kinds of development interventions can be implemented well\n            they involve time-consuming processes with numerous social\n            uncertainties which do not fit the time-frame of a typical\n            IDA project. More flexibility should be allowed in budget\n            releases and the use of allocated resettlement funds in a\n            given year since physical works of irrigation projects must\n            fit into narrow construction windows of the Delta area (i.e.\n            the six-month dry season) by allowing unused budget to be\n            carried over into the next fiscal year. This, however, may\n            require a reform of the budget management system at the MOF\n            and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development\n            (MARD). Technical design flexibility should be allowed at\n            project design, appraisal and continue to be so during\n            implementation stage to quickly respond to new demands from\n            beneficiaries. The implementation could be much quicker if\n            the Government could arrange sufficient counterpart fund to\n            advance the technical design process to ensure the early\n            project start-up."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Mekong Delta Water Resources Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Mekong Delta Water\n            Resources

The\n            prevention of salinity intrusion on canals serving the\n            agricultural areas, and the improvement of existing\n            irrigation systems, for those subprojects located in the\n            lower delta, are the main objectives. The main issues\n            concerning the Omon-Xano subproject, located in the\n            mid-delta, are to improve flood protection and drainage. The\n            project will facilitate local water and land transport, and\n            will finance land acquisition, compensation, and\n            resettlement expenses, incurred in as a consequence of the\n            project. The project's main components will: 1) improve\n            water resources infrastructure, through construction of\n            primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, together with the\n            necessary embankments, bridges, and roads. Compensation for\n            land acquisition and resettlement will be provided, as well\n            as training to affected families in drainage management\n            systems; 2) improve rural water supply and sanitation,\n            through clean water provision and better sanitation\n            processes; 3) strengthen water resources management and\n            improve environmental monitoring through institutional\n            capacity building. The component will manage engineering\n            design, implementation and supervision, and provide\n            institutional technical assistance and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -
