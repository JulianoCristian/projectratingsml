The lessons learned indicate that\n            programmatic lending serves as a useful vehicle for\n            economy-wide reforms. Nevertheless, with a complex operation\n            the size of the Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL), a frank\n            and informal dialogue and communication at all stages of the\n            programs becomes all the more crucial for the Bank and its\n            country counterparts. There is a need for the creation of a\n            Steering Committee at the Cabinet Level with a mandate to\n            oversee and monitor PSRL's progress, particularly on\n            the improved delivery of public services as well as for\n            pursuing a proactive communications strategy targeted to the\n            intended beneficiaries. In this regard, the GoJ has recently\n            established such a steering committee headed by the Minister\n            of Planning and includes as its members the Ministers of\n            Justice, Administrative Development, Finance,\n            Telecommunications and Information Technology, and Industry\n            ands Trade. The committee has been given the mandate to\n            oversee and monitor the public sector reform program.\n            Progress toward Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and\n            the integration of investment and current budgets within the\n            Ministry of Finance (MoF) should be accompanied by\n            commensurate budget preparation capabilities in the line\n            ministries. Parallel efforts need to be made within the\n            Ministry of Planning (MoP) for the formulation and\n            monitoring of the PIP (critical to the implementation of\n            NSETP). It is essential to develop monitoring and evaluation\n            capacity-for evaluating the both the progress of policies\n            and programs underpinning the entire reform

The\n            program will support Jordan by providing fast-disbursing\n            extenral financing to meet anticipated gaps originating from\n            its fiscal needs, while supporting fundamental structural\n            changes in its core public sector. The loan aims to\n            strengthen public institutional capacity and the quality of\n            public services; key objectives are to strengthen private\n            investment, diversify the economy, achieve closer\n            integration with the global economy, strengthen the\n            country's human capital base, and ensure better access\n            to services for citizens particularly the poor. By providing\n            fiscal support, the loan would reduce the risks of delays\n            and interruption in a difficult and lengthy process which is\n            being carried out in an inherently shock-prone economic and\n            political environment. It would improve the level and\n            quality of public services to better position Jordan to\n            attract foreign and domestic investment and to improve\n            services for all citizens. This comes out clearly from the\n            importance given to regulatory reform and to judicial\n            reform. In both cases the purpose is to improve the\n            stability and predictability of the business environment.\n            The loan would also further the Government's economic\n            strategy, which seeks to benefit from the increasing forces\n            of globalization by positioning Jordan as an efficient\n            platform for more human resource-intensive exports of
