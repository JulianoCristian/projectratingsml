Some lessons learned included: the lessons\n            from EMPEC are many, including, first and foremost, that\n            capacity building activities require the active\n            participation and involvement of governments and\n            stakeholders in order to yield good results. Moreover, the\n            Bank should prepare projects carefully and allow for\n            sufficient time to be able to build on lessons from the\n            past. Specific performance-monitoring indicators are\n            necessary to facilitate effective project supervision. As a\n            recent study on strengthening core functions within the\n            government has shown, long-term technical assistance to\n            public institutions could be more effective if replaced by\n            partnerships and twinning arrangements. An important lesson\n            may be drawn from the experience with PE reform: where the\n            means available to address a serious risk (resistance to\n            privatization) can at best be superficial or only partial,\n            project objectives and targets should be lowered to reflect\n            the uncertainty of success. More generally, it appears right\n            to question whether linking technical assistance projects so\n            tightly with structural adjustment operations is\n            appropriate; well-focused, free-standing technical\n            assistance, in selected areas of need, might have a better\n            chance for success in the medium term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -

To this end, the project hopes to:\n            (a) improve the management of the Public Enterprise Sector;\n            (b) improve sectoral and project work, statistical work and\n            the planning-programming and budgeting functions in the\n            Ministry of Planning and technical ministries; and (c)\n            improve the Public Expenditure Program process in the\n            Finance Ministry.  As a result, the project consists of\n            three components corresponding to each of the above\n            objectives with the public enterprise component as the main\n            focus of the project.  It involves financing to (i) launch\n            the operations of the National Service in Charge of Public\n            Enterprises (PEs); (ii) develop Government's planning\n            and project
