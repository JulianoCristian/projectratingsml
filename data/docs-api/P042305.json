Lessons drawn from the project focus on:\n            1) project design, outlining the need to distinguish\n            \"objectives\" to be achieved, from\n            \"impacts\" which should continue even after project\n            implementation. In particular, the design of education\n            projects should be realistic, in that education quality\n            improvement requires substantial time to attain measurable\n            impacts. Thus, the objectives of a short-time project, such\n            as this operation, should have been stated in a simple,\n            measurable, and attainable manner within the context of the\n            country. Moreover, complex project design, and\n            implementation arrangements should be matched to the\n            implementing agency's capacity, or, systematic capacity\n            development needs be built-in, as required by implementation\n            demands. In addition, innovative projects require a\n            realistic implementation timeframe, to allow effective\n            adaptation to, or adoption of new methodologies; this\n            project timeframe was too short for communities to adjust to\n            new approaches. Project design, and allocation of funds, and\n            time should look at attaining its development objectives,\n            therefore, attention should have been given to high-impact\n            qualitative inputs, i.e., teacher training, and\n            instructional materials; and, 2) project implementation,\n            whose arrangements need to be premised on country realities,\n            backed by comprehensive capacity assessment, and, it is\n            crucial that implementation readiness be developed at least,\n            at the early stages of implementation. The need for\n            Government commitment, and ownership is reinforced, to\n            ensure collaboration in monitoring, and evaluation, funds\n            allocation, management, and community mobilization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -
