In addition, both\n            performances by the Bank and Borrower are rated\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons address the following: 1) building\n            effective regulation capacity is a long term endeavor. The\n            objective was to make regulatory arrangements converge, in\n            the medium term, into an independent, fully operational and\n            multi-sectoral regulatory agency. However, progress made to\n            date needs to be sustained, and in line with global best\n            practices; and this effort requires an engagement beyond the\n            project life; 2) focus on outcomes should be at the center\n            of the dialogue with the client Government throughout\n            project implementation, to ensure not only its commitment,\n            but also that costly technical work is used; 3) Bank\n            supervision efforts should be consistent throughout the\n            project life, to ensure continued dialogue, and avoid delays\n            in project implementation, and an increased number of Bank\n            supervision missions should be attained, preferably with a\n            strengthened presence, for continued follow up on mission\n            conclusions. 4) effective communication with stakeholders is\n            key to successful implementation of a privatization program,\n            an effort which should be sustained, even amplified,\n            throughout project implementation, so as to overcome the\n            resistance of vested interests; and, 5) Co-financing is a\n            risk factor requiring mitigation throughout implementation.\n            Therefore, the Bank team should attempt to define realistic\n            performance indicators, taking into account only the\n            potential direct impact of the project in relation with the\n            Bank funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gabon -

The current program calls for:\n            (a) facilitating rapid divestiture from state enterprises\n            with major spin-off effects on factor costs and employment,\n            in transport, power, telecommunications, and the largest\n            agro-businesses; and (b) improving the efficiency of state\n            spending in core areas directly aimed at poverty reduction.\n            The project has five components: (1) Public understanding\n            and support of the reform program -obtained by: (a) setting\n            up and operating an information unit; (b) building\n            government capacity to use the media effectively and\n            establishing contacts with influential constituencies; (c)\n            researching public opinion; and (d) training journalists on\n            reporting economic and governance issues. (2) Regulatory\n            framework and capacity building -financing (a) a regulatory\n            agency for the infrastructure subsectors; (b) implementing\n            regulations and laws to attract private investment; and (c)\n            the training of regulatory agency staff. (3) Privatizing\n            selected large public enterprises in priority sectors with\n            financing for consultant and advisory services. (4)\n            Increasing local participation in privatization -preparing\n            to sell the government's minority shares by: (a)\n            drafting regulations on financial markets, trading\n            activities, and financial intermediaries; and (b) passing\n            laws to establish and regulate mutual funds; and (c)\n            updating current laws on securities issuance. (5) Improving\n            the business environment and promoting investment -by\n            financing (a) computerizing legal texts; (b) repealing,\n            amending, updating, or enacting applicable business laws;\n            (c) reviewing existing and alternative business dispute\n            resolution mechanisms; (d) revising the Labor Code; and (e)\n            auditing and
