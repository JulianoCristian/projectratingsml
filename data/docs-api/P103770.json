Some\n            lessons learned included: this DPL had a total of 44\n            indicators in its results indicator matrix. Furthermore,\n            several different indicators were used for key outcome\n            indicators in the loan and program summary table, inflating\n            the number of indicators to close to 50, which is not only\n            difficult to manage by the Bank, but especially by low\n            capacity clients. In the case of social security reforms,\n            the results matrix included indicators for revenues,\n            expenditures and deficit (both cash and actuarial). However,\n            the same reforms could be tracked with just one indicator.\n            The first component in the results indicator matrix had 16\n            indicators; however some of them were redundant like\n            measuring the primary balance according to LRF and Fiscal\n            Adjustment Program (PAF) methodology. Although, the numbers\n            differ from each other, they both respond to the same\n            policies and move in the same direction. The fact that one\n            target was achieved and the other was not just reflects\n            issues in the calibration of the target and not a failure of\n            the

They will also allow the state to use more\n            effectively its own resources and those transferred by the\n            federal Government to undertake a program of targeted\n            capital investments and improve its management capability.\n            Such improvements are a necessary condition for eventually\n            meeting the high order objectives of reducing poverty levels\n            and achieving levels of economic growth comparable to those\n            of other states in the region.

Sound macroeconomic\n            management, fiscal reform, efficient public sector\n            management, and good governance are key pillars of the CPS\n            strategy for achieving inclusive economic growth in Brazil.\n            The CPS also identifies support for the states (under\n            results-oriented public sector reforms) and improvement in\n            fiscal management as two of the most important areas of Bank\n            engagement. The loan will support reforms in key areas of\n            public administration, namely: a) fiscal adjustment; b)\n            human resource management; c) social security system for\n            civil servants; and d) public sector management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
