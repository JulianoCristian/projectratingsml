The lessons\n            learned indicate that in operations where approval of\n            reforms is uncertain, it is preferable to wait until they\n            are approved and then make the approved measures part of\n            conditionality. In some of the structural adjustment loans,\n            the submission of a law that incorporates the reforms is a\n            satisfactory condition for approval of it or for tranche\n            disbursement. The Tax Reform Adjustment Loan (TRAL) could\n            have been submitted for Board approval in its original form,\n            but the Bank and the Mexican Government decided to wait\n            until the reforms were approved by Congress. Based upon the\n            reforms that were approved, it was decided to lower the\n            amount of the loan. However, if the actions prior to the\n            Board presentation and first tranche disbursement had been\n            only the submission of the laws, with a second tranche after\n            the approval of these reforms, the project would have been\n            less successful because not all the reforms in the five\n            areas of the initial proposal were approved. Therefore, in\n            operations where the approval of reforms is risky, it is\n            better to wait until they are approved and have them as a\n            loan conditionality. Fiscal data estimates need to be\n            treated with caution. Mexican fiscal estimates -the only\n            sources for most data- have a tendency to be optimistic, so\n            for future World Bank operations these data needs to be\n            treated with caution and analysis based on them should be\n            adjusted. Congress needs to be involved right from the\n            beginning in any reform program that requires its approval.\n            In Mexico, the executive sent the fiscal reform package to\n            Congress with minimal prior discussion. As a result,\n            consideration of the reform took more than seven months, and\n            finally the initial reform proposal submitted to Congress\n            was changed substantially. Therefore, before the submission\n            of any reform to Congress, the reforms should be discussed\n            with the different political fractions to build a consensus\n            and facilitate approval."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Tax Reform Adjusment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Tax Reform Adjusment\n            Loan

the tax system, enhance macroeconomic\n            stability, improve equity in the personal income tax code,\n            and provide more tax resources to finance social programs.\n            In the area of corporate income taxes, the new law 1)\n            eliminates the special cash-flow regime for calculating\n            income for the agriculture and road transport sectors; 2)\n            simplifies the inflation adjustment regime, just using the\n            annual price index to calculate real change in monetary\n            assets and liabilites; 3) eliminates the reduced tax rate\n            for retained earnings, thus unifying the corporate and\n            maximum personal tax rates at 35 percent, and reduces the\n            rate gradually to 32 percent by 2005; 4) limits the\n            corporate deductions for payment of fringe benefits to\n            non-union workers; and 5) phases out the reduced tax rate\n            for the publishing industry, bringing the rate up to the\n            standard rate by 2006. In the area of personal income taxes,\n            the new law 1) aggregates all the taxable income of an\n            individual and taxes it at the corresponding progressive\n            rate; 2) simplifies the structure of rates, reducing the\n            number to five by 2005; 3) reduces the government subsidy\n            for workers in the formal sector and provides incentives for\n            firms to continue paying it; and 4) simplifies the tax\n            regime for individuals with entrepreneurial activity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Tax Reform Adjustment Loan
