Some lessons learned\n            included: the design and implementation of APL1 suggests\n            that the momentum generated either by adopting a new legal\n            framework or by accommodating an incoming administration\n            tends to foster an overly optimistic environment, in which\n            the actual possibilities for achieving goals in the short\n            and medium term are overestimated. The momentum may be very\n            conducive to setting ambitious, long-term goals and securing\n            political commitments but, if the borrower does not make a\n            clear distinction between the long-term reform goals and\n            what a small loan can achieve, overly ambitious objectives\n            and targets for an investment program may be included in\n            project design, without an appropriate evaluation of the\n            risks involved. Alternatively, the measurement of targets\n            that require very complex and costly studies may be more\n            suitable for an evaluation analysis where a new policy is\n            introduced than for project development objective (PDO)\n            indicators. Targets that can be measured periodically should\n            be closely monitored to determine whether they need to be\n            adjusted, especially if a clear trend of lack of progress\n            towards PDO indicator targets emerges. Moreover, the\n            supervision of procurement processes of civil works in the\n            health sector is highly complex due to various special\n            circumstances arising from the geographic dispersion of\n            health care units and the wide range of types of works (from\n            simple refurbishments in numerous but scattered health\n            centers to highly specialized infrastructure projects such\n            as hospitals and pharmaceutical warehouses). Therefore, the\n            bidding, planning, and implementation processes require\n            experienced teams that can take into account the realities\n            of the health sector civil works and of the market. Price\n            considerations may require an analysis of past experiences\n            with public bidding to avoid dealing with local firms that\n            may offer lower-than-market prices but later prove unable to\n            deliver, leading to lengthy processes for the cancellation\n            of contracts and costly investments to repair and preserve\n            investments already made."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Health Sector Reform\n            Support Project (APL1)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominican Republic - Health\n            Sector

The APL will implement three\n            components in three phases. A fourth component will manage\n            implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and assess\n            changes that would trigger the decision to continue to the\n            next phase or to change action for improving performance, or\n            in the last resort, to cancel the operation. Component 1\n            extends health service coverage in three priority regions\n            using the national health insurance financing mechanism to\n            deliver a basic health plan of essential health services,\n            particularly MCH services; strengthens the clinical\n            problem-solving capabilities of the primary health care\n            units (UNAPS) as well as the hospitals at the secondary and\n            tertiary care levels, improves the quality of medical care\n            provided, and ensures a functioning referral system; applies\n            national norms to improve physical infrastructure; and\n            develops integrated and decentralized health care networks\n            at the regional levels. Component 2 implements health sector\n            reform legislation. Component 3 improves selected essential\n            public health functions to promote and protect the health of\n            the population."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Health Reform
