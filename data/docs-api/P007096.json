The project was designed to\n            increase Guayaquil low water service coverage and to improve\n            the Municipal Water Supply Company performance to handle an\n            increased customer base in a more efficient and financially\n            sound manner. The project's physical objectives have\n            been largely achieved. The Bank's performance was\n            deficient in identification preparation, and appraisal work.\n            Lessons from the unsatisfactory first project were not\n            sufficiently absorbed, and the difficulty to strengthen the\n            water supply company was vastly underestimated. The overall\n            performance of the Borrower was deficient, particularly in\n            1989-91 after disbursements were suspended. The project\n            outcome is rated as highly unsatisfactory. The project\n            provided several important lessons for water supply\n            operations: 1) Institutional strengthening of public\n            companies should not be attempted when there is a lack of an\n            enabling political and institutional environment that\n            broadly influences the company; 2) Establish clear and\n            quantifiable objectives and goals from the beginning; 3)\n            During the preparation stage ensure full commitment of the\n            beneficiaries and assess their willingness to pay, as\n            integral part of the financial viability of the project; 4)\n            Introduce private management (concession) as an alternative\n            to improving water supply systems; 5) Well staffed and\n            trained project executing unit, with adequate autonomy to\n            make operational decisions about project implementation must\n            be in place at the time project execution begins."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Second Guayaquil and Guayas\n            Province Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Second Guayaquil and\n            Guayas
