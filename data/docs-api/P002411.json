The lessons learned indicate that\n            the approach to power system development in Sierra Leone has\n            been fragmented rather than integrated. It might have been\n            helpful for the Staff Appraisal Report to focus on issues\n            such as cost reduction, which would involve rehabilitating\n            oil-based generation and also actively seeking alternatives,\n            such as hydropower, as well as low-cost distribution\n            facilities. In post-conflict situations with significant\n            destruction of infrastructure, the physical aspects of power\n            development may take precedence over the institutional\n            development aspects of power system development; and it may\n            not be possible to move rapidly to the full privatization of\n            a power utility. Local efficient utility management\n            contractors are likely to have an advantage over foreign\n            managers. They can be more adept in preparing and selling\n            reform packages to the public and are likely to inspire a\n            greater sense of trust. Although a project's objectives\n            may be general enough to encompass a restructuring, major\n            reallocations of resources may change indicators used to\n            evaluate the achievement of objectives. For example,\n            devastation during the conflict led to the restructuring of\n            the Sierra Leone Rehabilitation Project, putting more focus\n            on rehabilitation of physical infrastructure and less\n            emphasis on institutional development of National Power\n            Authority and future power system development. The lack of\n            attention to modifying the objective can cause difficulties\n            in the evaluation of project performance at completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Power
