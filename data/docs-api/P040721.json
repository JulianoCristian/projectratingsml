Some lessons learned included: broad-spectrum\n            change in a complex sector where there is limited experience\n            can be made effective through a learning-oriented and\n            continuously adaptive program approach aimed at establishing\n            a platform for future development. While financial\n            independence for providers of agricultural services is\n            generally desirable, self-financing options need to take\n            account of the public goods nature of some services, the\n            special needs of poorer rural communities, and the rate at\n            which communities and entrepreneurs can adapt to a\n            pay-for-service environment. Inclusion of women and poorer\n            families in rural development can be particularly effective\n            if based on proactive investigation of the needs of\n            vulnerable groups, practical social and economic measures to\n            respond to these needs, and monitoring and adapting these\n            measures during implementation. A strong monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) system is particularly important for\n            projects that pioneer new approaches, and may need\n            adjustment as implementation progresses. Monitorable\n            indicators to measure achievements against the project\n            objectives, and M&E arrangements, need to be detailed\n            prior to project commencement including

Some lessons\n            learned included: project design and implementation\n            arrangements need to be tailored to the client's\n            capacity, and work plans for at least the first year of all\n            project components need to be in place and agreed to before\n            the start of implementation. Major policy and legislative\n            reform across multiple sectors or sub-sectors, which require\n            prudent management of the political processes and of\n            multiple stakeholders, should not be expected to be\n            accomplished in only a few years. Establishing baseline and\n            target values for key indicators are and having an effective\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system are essential for\n            measuring progress and impact. Proactive supervision and\n            implementation support can overcome project design\n            weaknesses. A multi-component project covering an entire\n            sector of the economy can be an effective tool to address\n            issues across a range of related sub-sectors and thereby\n            generate important synergies. It also provides more\n            flexibility than a more narrowly focused project to respond\n            more quickly and readily to unforeseen new needs and\n            requirements, by allowing resource reallocations, shortening\n            decision-making processes and facilitating inter-agency\n            coordination and collaboration. Support services for\n            primarily poor clients, such as a rural advisory service,\n            are unlikely to attain financial viability and complete\n            self-financing in a transition economy and do require public\n            funding for their public-good aspects for a considerable time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Agricultural Support\n            Services
