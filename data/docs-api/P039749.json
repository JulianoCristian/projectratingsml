The lessons\n            learned indicate that an institutional capacity assessment\n            of this project would have identified key constraints which\n            could have been used to strengthen project design, and\n            identified more realistic outcome indicators to more\n            objectively measure achievements. The Bank should be more\n            realistic in what can actually be achieved within a single\n            investment operation. As with previous projects, once\n            monitoring indicators have been agreed to during project\n            preparation, resources should be dedicated to collecting all\n            baseline data. It is important to assess Government\n            commitment to reform initiatives based on clear commitment\n            from both the MOP as well as the sectoral ministry\n            responsible for implementation and not solely from the MOP.\n            For activities that require ongoing financial and other\n            resources after the project closes, dialogue on\n            sustainability arrangements need to be held and agreements\n            incorporated in the project appraisal document during\n            preparation. Closer attention should have been paid to\n            implementing the QAG quality-at-entry (QAE) assessment\n            recommendations of this project which were crucial to\n            implementation success. In relation to the previous\n            recommendation and for all projects in general, QAE\n            assessments should be more dynamic rather than being mainly\n            treated as a standard Bank requirement. In terms of future\n            support of the health sector in Jordan, the Bank needs to be\n            more selective in the areas it chooses to support, focusing\n            on activities where the Bank has a comparative advantage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan -

The Health Sector Reform Project supports the first\n            phase of the reform program, and its main objectives are to\n            contain growth in health expenditures, improve health care\n            services, and assure efficiency in the use of physical\n            facilities. The project components include: 1) The\n            rationalization of the investment strategy for health\n            delivery systems, which will directly support economic\n            efficiency improvement. A health facility masterplan will\n            incorporate norms and standards, overall needs, and public\n            and private sector capacity. 2) The development of health\n            information systems, which will provide relevant and timely\n            epidemiological data and improve management information\n            systems for patients record keeping, services, inventory,\n            and personnel. 3) The improvement of private hospital\n            financing will establish accounting standards and adjust\n            budgetary allocations efficiently. 4) The reform of the\n            pharmaceutical sector will promote generic substitution,\n            rationalize the use of drugs, and reform drug procurement.\n            5) A continuing reform process will be addressed, and\n            special studies conducted. Technical expertise recruits will\n            aim at exploring alternative reform proposals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Health Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Health Sector Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/03/441538/jordan-health-sector-reform-project","projn":"JO-Health Sector Reform -- P039749","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Economics & Finance","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Jordan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99032505565942"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ability to pay,aging,architects,basic health\n            services,communicable diseases,contraceptives,cost\n            effectiveness,Economic Analysis,economic\n            efficiency,engineers,epidemiological\n            transition,expenditures,family planning,feasibility\n            studies,Finance,financial management,Health,health care\n            services,Health Delivery,Health Delivery System,health\n            education,health expenditures,health facilities,Health\n            Information Systems,health insurance,health outcomes,health\n            providers,Health Reform,Health Sector,Health Services,health\n            system,high fertility,hospice,hospice care,hospital\n            equipment,hospitals,immunization,income,infant\n            mortality,infant mortality rates,life\n            expectancy,managers,Marketing,medical education,medical\n            equipment,medical personnel,Medical\n            Services,migration,morbidity,mortality,National Drug\n            Policy,NGOs,nurses,occupancy,occupancy\n            rates,Partnership,Patients,physicians,primary care,Primary\n            Health Care,private sector,public health,public\n            hospitals,public sector,quality control,quality of health\n            care,refugees,rehabilitation,service delivery,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"ability to pay,aging,architects,basic health\n            services,communicable diseases,contraceptives,cost\n            effectiveness,Economic Analysis,economic\n            efficiency,engineers,epidemiological\n            transition,expenditures,family planning,feasibility\n            studies,Finance,financial management,Health,health care\n            services,Health Delivery,Health Delivery System,health\n            education,health expenditures,health facilities,Health\n            Information Systems,health insurance,health outcomes,health\n            providers,Health Reform,Health Sector,Health Services,health\n            system,high fertility,hospice,hospice care,hospital\n            equipment,hospitals,immunization,income,infant\n            mortality,infant mortality rates,life\n            expectancy,managers,Marketing,medical education,medical\n            equipment,medical personnel,Medical\n            Services,migration,morbidity,mortality,National Drug\n            Policy,NGOs,nurses,occupancy,occupancy\n            rates,Partnership,Patients,physicians,primary care,Primary\n            Health Care,private sector,public health,public\n            hospitals,public sector,quality control,quality of health\n            care,refugees,rehabilitation,service delivery,waste"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022213-CANADIAN GENERAL CTF II-EGYPT,TF035377-JORDAN -
