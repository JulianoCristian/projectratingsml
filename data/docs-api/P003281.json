Some lessons learned include:\n            During preparation for the audit, three issues were\n            identified for attention: decentralization, costs and donor\n            coordination. Although the project supports the\n            decentralization of services, the question of what\n            decentralization meant, and the precise relationships at the\n            community level between various ministries, was not clearly\n            identified in the project documents at appraisal, and\n            relationships have evolved since that time. Difficulties\n            attributable to the challenge of creating effective\n            interagency relationships in the name of achieving project\n            goals are evident in this project. For example, the\n            strengthening of community level services was also\n            negatively affected by the transfer of Village Health\n            Workers (VHW) to the Ministry of Cooperatives, Community\n            Development and Women's Affairs. The serious cost\n            overruns in this project -- for civil works and for\n            equipment -- indicate the importance of paying close\n            attention to the bread and butter matters of design,\n            tendering, procurement and maintenance. The main positive\n            outcome of the cost overruns is the firm way in which the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) has realized that this must be\n            avoided in future. One lesson drawn is the need for greater\n            flexibility in the design of district hospitals. Finally,\n            the development of a more proactive stance toward donor\n            coordination on the part of the MOH, and reports of growing\n            satisfaction with this approach among several donors,\n            reinforces the lesson that greater ownership can increase\n            the effectiveness of external resources for health activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe -
