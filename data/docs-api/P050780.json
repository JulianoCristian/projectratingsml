Overall\n            performances by the Bank and the Borrower are judged as\n            satisfactory. These were the lessons learned from this\n            experience: Establishment of a private pension system can\n            provide a major stimulus to capital markets development. In\n            parallel with efforts to strengthen regulation of capital\n            markets, pension reform significantly increased the funds\n            available to flow into productive investment\n            opportunities--including the debt instruments of private\n            firms and municipal and regional governments. Limited\n            privatization has constrained equity investment\n            opportunities. Further privatization of viable firms, as\n            well as improved corporate governance and accounting\n            transparency, would offer substantial benefits for the\n            country. In a radical pension reform, sufficient time should\n            be provided for developing administrative capacity. The Bank\n            became involved in pension reform after Kazakhstan had\n            decided on the design of the reform. Even though it was not\n            an ideal situation, and more time and more detailed analysis\n            might have been preferable, the Bank made the correct\n            decision to \"board the train.\" To the greatest\n            extent possible, conditionality should focus on outcome.\n            Lastly, to the extent possible, conditionality focused on\n            unpredictable

to a fully funded pension system by\n            financing part of the estimated 1.7 percent of the GDP\n            (Gross Domestic Product) fiscal deficit brought about by\n            pension reform. The move to a funded system will continue\n            the transition to a market economy by encouraging savings,\n            creating an attitude of self-reliance among the population,\n            reducing the public sector, and deepening capital markets.\n            The loan will be disbursed in three tranches. By providing\n            for the development of non-state accumulation plans, the\n            pension reform will foster the development of capital\n            markets and improve the aggregate economic efficiency of\n            investments. The reform will also develop skills needed in a\n            market economy bolstering the financial sector, the banking\n            sector, and the insurance industry. The reform will reduce\n            payroll taxation and, as a result, encourage employment.\n            While the reform initially incurs additional budgetary\n            costs, in the longer run, as benefits from the old system\n            are phased out, budgetary costs will be reduced\n            considerably. In the longer run, the reform will lead to\n            increased savings and faster economic growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Pension Reform Adjustment Loan
