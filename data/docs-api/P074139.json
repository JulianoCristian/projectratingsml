Some lessons learned included:\n            the Bank should be proactive in making the decision to\n            either withdraw from a project or adopt other alternative\n            measures to change a project's course when it is\n            recognized that critical implementation issues cannot be\n            resolved in a timely manner. The Constructed Wetlands (CW)\n            technology was new to Moldova, which had been used to the\n            overdesigned former Soviet conventional Wastewater Treatment\n            Plants (WWTPs). The technology was perceived as inferior and\n            therefore unacceptable. Moreover, the Bank may face a\n            reputational risk in appearing to be promoting and/or\n            \"overselling? specific activities or technologies with\n            strong resistance from critical stakeholders even where the\n            activities may be technically and economically justified. In\n            this case several clients referred to the technology as\n            'the Bank's' technology which increases the\n            Bank's reputational risk. The importance of preparing a\n            sound Results Framework comprising adequate indicators to\n            capture key project outcomes, with baseline data and\n            reasonable targets or a clear plan to obtain this data as\n            soon as possible after the onset of implementation if not\n            available, cannot be over-emphasized for good project design\n            and implementation readiness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -

Component 1 is made up of 2 sub-components:\n            Component 1-A is the Wastewater management in Soroca, which\n            will finance: (i) the rehabilitation of wastewater\n            collection system, necessary sewerage pressure pipelines and\n            the construction of wastewater treatment facility using\n            constructed wetlands technology for the municipality of\n            Soroca; and (ii six months' operations of the facility\n            in order to train the Apa Canal staff in the proper\n            operations and maintenance of the facility; Component 1-B,\n            Engineering Consultant and TA, will support: (i) Engineering\n            services for wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and sewer\n            network design, procurement, supervision support, and a six\n            months' operational assistance for WWTP; and (ii)\n            Feasibility studies for 10 towns and pre-feasibility studies\n            for an additional 5 towns, including replication of\n            constructed wetland system in the studies. Component 2,\n            Dissemination and Replication Component related to\n            Constructed Wetlands, will target the dissemination of\n            experience and knowledge obtained from operation of the new\n            Soroca WWTP. Component 3, Institutional Strengthening\n            Component, will finance: (i) the development of a\n            communication strategy and capacity building for media\n            campaign and community and civil- society outreach to\n            prepare for the necessary increase of a sewage treatment\n            surcharge; and (ii) Apa Canal staff training for operational\n            efficiency improvements. Component 4 is Project Management,\n            which will support management and implementation of the\n            project, including auditing services, by the Project\n            Implementing Unit (PIU) in the Agency for Construction and\n            Territorial Development (ACTD)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -
