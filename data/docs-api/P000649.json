Construction and rehabilitation achievements\n            of health centers, and of the Ministry of Health (MOH)\n            buildings, were successful, yet, these were later found to\n            be underutilized, and deteriorating. The project failed in\n            strengthening management capacity at central, regional, and\n            delivery levels, including in major hospitals. The health\n            management information system, never became operational,\n            which hindered the health strategy, and decision capacity of\n            the MOH. Several key lessons may be drawn from the project:\n            1) Upon identification of risks, such as poor management\n            capacity, and implementation by the Borrower, adequate\n            technical assistance (TA), and institutional support should\n            be planned for project implementation. This TA should work\n            closely with, and transfer skills to qualified national\n            counterparts. 2) Project ownership should be ensured,\n            through staff continuity, from the Bank, as from the\n            government, to achieve the necessary involvement, as of\n            preparation, through full implementation. 3) The lack of\n            adequate supervision by Bank staff, prevented addressing\n            potential risks, which could have solved project\n            difficulties - particularly in a complex case, and a weak\n            Borrower capacity. 4) The continued lack of reaction from\n            the Bank's management, needs to be addressed as an\n            institutional weakness, which severely compromises its credibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Equatorial Guinea -
