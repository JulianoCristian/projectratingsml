Some\n            lessons learned included: in a regional project with high\n            potential for political priorities to dominate a project,\n            the point of entry for collaboration was built first on\n            technical cooperation (trust building and collaboration on\n            research front), which then facilitated political\n            collaboration across countries (regional collaboration and\n            counterpart contribution to project, support to the Regional\n            Policy and Steering Committee (RPSC) and Southwest Indian\n            Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), leading to economic\n            approach and discussions. Although the preparation from\n            2003-2007 was much longer than most operations at that time,\n            the project was a complex regional operation and obtaining\n            country ownership played an important role in the\n            project's results. Political commitment throughout\n            preparation and implementation was essential to maintaining\n            the momentum of the operation, not only at national level\n            but also at the regional level for coordination and\n            oversight (SWIOFC and the RPSC). In a project which is\n            heavily output-based, evaluating capacity building aspects\n            is an important means of assessing outcomes and impact. By\n            signing one grant agreement with Kenya on behalf of all the\n            beneficiary countries, instead of a grant agreement per\n            beneficiary country, the project managed to pool financial\n            resources. The Bank can explore ways to delink the\n            cross-conditionality in regional operations involving\n            multiple countries by allowing separate dates of\n            effectiveness when multiple project agreements are involved.\n            Use of country systems is meant to provide a standard\n            procurement process for projects, but in reality places\n            additional burdens on implementation agencies, and requires\n            more coordination, procurement experience, and time to\n            implement successfully. Relations with the client countries\n            were facilitated with the selection of the right skills mix\n            (trilingual task manager and fisheries specialist) and the\n            use of translation services for meetings and implementation\n            aide memoires. Successful project experiences need to be\n            shared with other projects, especially with regional\n            operations and similar projects in the global environment\n            facility (GEF) portfolio. As the project activities move\n            into a follow-up phase, sustainability issues to consider\n            will be quality and verification of data, sustaining\n            operation and maintenance costs of the knowledge and data\n            bases, staff turnover, financing of high cost operations\n            such as the surveys and observer activities, and support to\n            the regional bodies for the longer terms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa -
