Project\n            sustainability is likely. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are rated satisfactory. Best practice in\n            identifying needed reforms in technical training programs\n            was reflected in using panels of experts at national and\n            state levels, including curricula specialists,\n            representatives of the productive sectors, and education\n            specialists. Expanding the scope of activities for the\n            technical education school (CONALEP) transformed the\n            institution from a strictly pre-work technical training\n            agency to a comprehensive system offering pre- and\n            on-the-job training, technical assistance, and quality and\n            productivity enhancement to industry, and represents a good\n            model. An important lesson was learned from the lack of\n            success of regional maintenance centers and the better\n            results achieved by assigning building and equipment\n            maintenance responsibilities to each training center,\n            allowing them to use private contractors to maintain major\n            equipment. A more conclusive analysis of costs in relation\n            to outcomes would have provided a firmer basis to guide\n            resource allocation among programs and fine-tuned training\n            activities. The flexible staffing policies adopted by\n            CONALEP was a key factor in modernizing the institution and\n            provided an important lesson about the central role played\n            by personnel policies during institutional change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Third Technical Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Third Technical Training
