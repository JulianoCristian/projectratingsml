      outcome of the project was rated satisfactory, the\n            performance of the Bank and the Borrower were rated also\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (i) that a single-tranche, rapid disbursing adjustment\n            operation is a good vehicle for restoring policy reform\n            momentum after a hiatus period because it allows the\n            authorities to demonstrate their intention to make progress\n            without committing either the borrower or the bank to what\n            would have been an incomplete reform agenda; (ii) that the\n            adverse security situation significantly complicates, but\n            does not preclude a successful adjustment operation,\n            although reform measures that rely heavily on external\n            technical inputs probably should not be included; and (iii)\n            macroeconomic reforms and measures aimed at liberalizing\n            trade and the external sector have proven far easier to\n            achieve than have measures to privatize and deregulate the\n            domestic economy, but without significant progress in\n            privatization and deregulation, the positive effects of\n            external reforms will be muted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Economic Rehabilitation

population. The ERL will provide urgent support for the\n            reform effort by continuing the progress achieved under the\n            two previous adjustment loans, and by laying the groundwork\n            for the preparation of future adjustment operations. The\n            project will support a broad program of policy reforms to\n            accelerate Algeria's transition to a market economy.\n            The key components of the program include macroeconomic\n            stabilization, trade and price liberalization, private\n            sector development, privatization, restructuring of the\n            public enterprise sector, public
