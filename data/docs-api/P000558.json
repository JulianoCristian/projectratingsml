balance between the public and private sectors in\n            order to overcome the present severe fiscal and economic\n            imbalances and to foster growth of the non-oil sectors. The\n            first phase of the adjustment program for 1987-88 focuses\n            on: (i) reinforcing controls on public expenditures and\n            elaborating sectoral strategies to guide future policies and\n            investments; (ii) instituting a sound framework for\n            management of the petroleum sector; and (iii) price\n            liberalization and incentive policies to encourage\n            competition and private sector development. In addition, the\n            project involves (iv) enhancing public enterprise (PE)\n            autonomy and establishing greater accountability; (v)\n            starting a program of enterprise rehabilitation and\n            rationalization through privatizations and liquidations; and\n            (vi) devising a program of the PE sector's financial\n            restructuring and measures to instill financial discipline.\n            Through the formulation of sectoral strategies, the program\n            will also advance the preparation of the next phase of
