This could have been counterbalanced by the energy\n            conservation, - key value-added component - for this was the\n            main justification for project implementation. However,\n            given the appraisal focus, for a sound pricing policy for\n            energy products, the intended sectoral development impact,\n            could not have been achieved. The key lessons re-emphasize,\n            the importance of a consistent government commitment,\n            particularly in addressing sensitive sector issues. The\n            absence of this commitment, did not facilitate any progress\n            to the development of the Energy Conservation Study, while\n            the structure of the loan, provided little, if any,\n            incentive for its progress. Nevertheless, the provision of\n            an additional component, specifically to the Ministry of\n            Commerce, Industry and Energy, could potentially have been\n            an incentive for the energy conservation program to\n            progress. Secondly, the pipeline's network poor rate of\n            return indicate that even the most apparently\n            financially-viable projects can be undermined by unforeseen\n            exogenous factors, namely, the regional financial crises,\n            and to some extent, the oil low price. Possibly, the\n            requirement of satisfactory transportation quantities, could\n            have been agreed with the refineries, with direct government
