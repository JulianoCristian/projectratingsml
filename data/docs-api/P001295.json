The study has drawn some key conclusions: 1) The\n            projects helped support the rapid economic growth, and raise\n            the standard of living in Nairobi throughout the last two\n            decades. Particularly in the field of water supply and\n            sanitation, the results are sustainable. On the other hand,\n            although progress was made in developing housing programs,\n            no lasting impact was achieved in terms of housing policies\n            and cost recovery in the housing sector. In the area of\n            institutional development, the Water and Sewerage Department\n            of the Nairobi City Council serves as a good example of\n            substantial achievements on effective capacity building. The\n            report presents recommendations for future operations in the\n            areas of sequencing of technical assistance and investment\n            intervention, design of housing
