Some lessons learned included: 1) Bank\n            assistance should pay particular attention to food security\n            issues in countries with chronic food insecurity and\n            vulnerability to natural disasters; 2) To address food\n            insecurity a regional approach which promoted regional trade\n            is needed; 3) It is essential to the success of a public\n            works project to establish apriority objective of public\n            works between quick income generation and creation and/or\n            rehabilitation of assets with an acceptable technical\n            standard.

- Emergency Drought Recovery Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall objectives of the Emergency\n            Drought Recovery Project (EDRP) for Zambia were to assist\n            the government in maintaining key commitments to its\n            economic and investment priorities as laid out in the\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) while meeting the\n            exigencies of the food crisis, and to help restore\n            productive capability of the affected population. The\n            development objective was not revised during project\n            implementation. Principal performance ratings are as\n            follows: project outcome was satisfactory; sustainability\n            was likely; institutional development impact was modest; and\n            Bank and borrower performance was satisfactory. A number of\n            lessons have been derived from the project and, it is hoped,\n            will be learned by both the Bank and its borrowers. Some of\n            the lessons learned are: The EDRP aimed at incorporating\n            lessons learned from previous emergency projects, such as\n            ' emergency operations must be simple and rapidly\n            executable, and not undertake too broad an agenda of\n            cross-cutting issues ', ' speed in implementation\n            is a critical element of success '. These lessons\n            remain valid, but they were not practiced during EDRP\n            implementation. 2) Short term and long term objectives\n            should not be combined in one lending instrument. 3) The\n            Bank needs to apply its disbursement and procurement\n            guidelines more flexibly in future emergency operations in\n            order to adequately meet the urgent needs of the client, 4)\n            Appropriate outcome-orientated monitoring and evaluation\n            indicators must be identified at appraisal, even in an\n            emergency operation when project preparation time is\n            limited. The PIU was charged with identifying additional\n            project performance indicators, but ultimately failed to\n            complete the task. 5) Finally, the implementation of a\n            multi-sectoral project such as the EDRP, should be\n            complemented by multi-sectoral donor coordination to avoid\n            duplication and inconsistencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia -

The project consists of four\n            components: 1) quick-disbursing assistance to finance a\n            positive list of imports; 2) safety net interventions aimed\n            at improving access to food and services by vulnerable\n            groups; 3) distribution of agricultural inputs and\n            technologies to help farmers restart agriculture; and 4)\n            strengthening government's early warning system and\n            capacity for disaster mitigation and management. Benefits\n            include reducing the hardship caused by the food emergency,\n            while helping to maintain investments in health, education,\n            and rural infrastructure. The project will enhance the\n            capacity of vulnerable groups to access goods and services\n            by providing temporary employment and income supplements\n            through public works and other targeted interventions. Risks\n            derive from limitations in the capacity of the government to\n            handle complex issues related to the logistics and\n            distribution of food and other critical supplies to\n            vulnerable people."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Emergency Drought Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - Emergency Drought\n            Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/10/2045307/zambia-emergency-drought-recovery-project","projn":"ZM-Emergency Drought Recovery Project -- P080612","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,National Governance,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Zambia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02110204012363"},"subsc":"Other social services,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"advertising,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural infrastructure,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agricultural\n            technology,agriculture,animal health,authority,balance of\n            payments,capacity\n            building,cattle,cereals,commodities,Competitive\n            Bidding,conditionality,consignment,cropping,crops,disasters,Districts,drinking\n            water,eating habits,economic growth,Economic\n            impact,employment,entitlements,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditure,expenditures,extension,families,FAO,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizers,financial\n            assistance,Financial management,FISCAL,food needs,food\n            prices,food security,food supplies,food supply,foreign\n            exchange,government agencies,government ministries,health\n            services,imports,income,incomes,inflation,institutional\n            arrangements,internal\n            audit,intervention,legislation,livelihoods,livestock,local\n            government,maize,Malnutrition,marketing,Ministry of\n            Finance,morbidity,National Planning,NGOs,nongovernmental\n            organizations,oil,patients,Poverty\n            reduction,precipitation,private sector,private sector\n            investment,producers,productivity,public agencies,Public\n            Procurement,public sector,Public Welfare,purchasing\n            power,rehabilitation,representatives,Rural Development,rural\n            roads,Social Risks,social safety,social safety net,Social\n            safety nets,social services,social support,soil\n            management,soils,tradeoffs,United Nations,wages,widows"},"1":{"cdata!":"advertising,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural infrastructure,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agricultural\n            technology,agriculture,animal health,authority,balance of\n            payments,capacity\n            building,cattle,cereals,commodities,Competitive\n            Bidding,conditionality,consignment,cropping,crops,disasters,Districts,drinking\n            water,eating habits,economic growth,Economic\n            impact,employment,entitlements,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditure,expenditures,extension,families,FAO,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizers,financial\n            assistance,Financial management,FISCAL,food needs,food\n            prices,food security,food supplies,food supply,foreign\n            exchange,government agencies,government ministries,health\n            services,imports,income,incomes,inflation,institutional\n            arrangements,internal\n            audit,intervention,legislation,livelihoods,livestock,local\n            government,maize,Malnutrition,marketing,Ministry of\n            Finance,morbidity,National Planning,NGOs,nongovernmental\n            organizations,oil,patients,Poverty\n            reduction,precipitation,private sector,private sector\n            investment,producers,productivity,public agencies,Public\n            Procurement,public sector,Public Welfare,purchasing\n            power,rehabilitation,representatives,Rural Development,rural\n            roads,Social Risks,social safety,social safety net,Social\n            safety nets,social services,social support,soil\n            management,soils,tradeoffs,United Nations,wages,widows"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"T7559"},"facets":{}}}
