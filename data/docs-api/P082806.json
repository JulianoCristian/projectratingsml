Some lessons learned included: two of the\n            reasons why the transport sector reforms in general and the\n            ports and airports concession in particular were not\n            entirely successful were: (i) the high-level political\n            interference in the sector, and (ii) the overambitious\n            target to concession all the ports and airports in the\n            country. The instability risk raises the question about the\n            adequacy of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instruments\n            which were designed to support a long-term transport sector\n            transformational agenda. The choice of the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) indicators should take into\n            account the type of data which can be collected during\n            implementation. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E)\n            system of the TIIP did not make clear distinction between\n            the achievements under: (a) the standalone project; (b) the\n            APL series; and (c) the government long-term program. As a\n            result, it was not easy to assess the achievements, the\n            outcomes and the impacts of the project. Some sections had\n            to be rehabilitated or reconstructed contributing to a\n            higher cost than anticipated. Proactivity and innovation\n            during project implementation are necessary to adapting to\n            an ever changing environment. While supporting railway\n            concession, ensure enabling environment and fair intermodal competition."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Transport Infrastructure\n            Investment

The extension\n            of the closing date is being processed as a level two\n            restructuring, requiring the Vice President's approval\n            since it involves a cumulative extension of the closing date\n            of more than two years from the original closing date. This\n            extension will allow for: 1) the completion of the suspended\n            works contracts as a result of the disbursement freeze due\n            to the crisis, in order to reinforce the outcome of our\n            investments in railways infrastructure; 2) the payment of\n            arrears for works, goods, and services for contracts\n            committed after March 17, 2009, and whose corresponding\n            services have been duly completed, and 3) the use of the\n            remaining funds of SDR2.87 millions, after the payment of\n            the two above-mentioned items, to finance transport\n            equipment and infrastructure, for unfinished road surface\n            layer, slope stabilizations, and some consultancy services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar -
