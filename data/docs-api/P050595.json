The first request was submitted by members of the\n            Naso indigenous group and the second by representatives of\n            some Ngobe-Bugle, another indigenous group living in the\n            'annex areas' to the Comarca Ngobe-Bugle in Bocas\n            del Toro Province. Both requests for inspection are related\n            to the consolidation of indigenous peoples' territories\n            and involve OD 4.20 (indigenous peoples) and 13.05 (project\n            supervision) as the relevant Bank policies. Management\n            appreciates the Panel's finding of broad concurrence\n            with Bank policies and procedures applicable to the project\n            and acknowledges the Panel's observations on specific\n            instances of non-compliance during project design and during\n            supervision in the early years, and its observations on\n            systemic issues. To address the instances of non compliance,\n            Management has proposed an action plan including the\n            following: 1) Management has offered its support to the\n            Government to identify key issues that should be addressed\n            in a more comprehensive Indigenous Peoples Development Plan\n            (IPDP), which the Government may update and treat as a model\n            for future programs involving indigenous peoples in Panama;\n            2) Management will ensure that the funds declared ineligible\n            related to inadequate consultations with indigenous peoples\n            identified during project supervision are returned to the\n            Bank before the loan account is closed; 3) management will\n            recommend to the recently-created National Authority of Land\n            Administration (ANATI) that addressing the outstanding land\n            claims of the Naso should be one of its immediate\n            priorities; and 4) finally, management will make use of\n            available opportunities to continue its engagement on\n            Indigenous Peoples' issues in Panama. Drawing upon the\n            lessons learned from the design and implementation of this\n            project, as well as other development projects in Panama,\n            Management will support a multi-stakeholder workshop before\n            June 2011 to discuss good practice approaches and strategies\n            to promote inclusive development of indigenous peoples."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Land Administration Project :\n            management report and recommendation in response to the\n            inspection panel investigation report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Land Administration\n            Project : management report and recommendation in response\n            to the inspection panel investigation report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/10/12956822/panama-land-administration-project-management-report-recommendation-response-inspection-panel-investigation-report","projn":"PA-Land Administration Project -- P050595","docty":"Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Labor Policies,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Panama","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20101102025728"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Forestry","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adverse consequences, audits, Bank\n            compliance, Bank Management, communities, consolidation,\n            description, development projects, Districts, economic\n            development, eviction, extension, financial transactions,\n            Government officials, Housing, Indigenous Peoples,\n            integrity, intervention, INVESTIGATION, Judiciary, Justice,\n            land tenure, Laws, leadership, legal framework, livestock,\n            Local Government, mandates, municipalities, nongovernmental\n            organizations, participatory approaches, participatory\n            development, police, political economy, procurement,\n            productivity, property rights, public information, rentals,\n            risk factors, rural areas, scientists, taxation, technical\n            assistance, transparency, urban areas"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF025367-PHRD-LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF025501-PHRD-LAND ADMINISTRATION,TF040956-HONDURAS: LAND AMINISTRATION","repnb":"57601"},"14560465":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/03/14560465/panama-land-administration-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/03/14560465/panama-land-administration-project","new_url":"2010/03/14560465/panama-land-administration-project","disclosure_date":"2011-08-15T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-08-15T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-08-15T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/07/12/000333038_20110712233330/Rendered/INDEX/ICR16610P050590e0only0900BOX361509B.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/07/12/000333038_20110712233330/Rendered/PDF/ICR16610P050590e0only0900BOX361509B.pdf","loan_no":"7045","datestored":"2011-07-12T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2010-03-04T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Panama - Land Administration Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Land Administration\n            Project for Panama were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: sequencing of reforms, with initial\n            efforts focusing on the technical reforms and related legal\n            and institutional changes, has shown to be a more effective\n            approach towards modernization and sustainability of land\n            administration systems. Addressing the political and\n            institutional aspects of land tenure issues, particularly as\n            they relate to Indigenous Peoples, is complex. Operations\n            for consolidation of indigenous lands should be embedded in\n            and ideally preceded by a robust policy dialogue related to\n            indigenous peoples' land rights' regularization.\n            The project attempted and to some extent succeeded in\n            opening up such dialogue, but was an insufficient instrument\n            to do so in a comprehensive way. As exemplified in this and\n            other recent land administration projects in the region, the\n            effective integration of the cadastre and registry functions\n            and data into a common technical platform (even without\n            requiring a single agency) is extremely difficult. This\n            institutional rivalry tends to be very entrenched and there\n            is very little external pressure to overcome it. Although\n            land administration projects have the potential to yield\n            considerable benefits to the poor, through more secure land\n            tenure, this Project has not been able to show that these\n            benefits necessarily translate into poverty reduction. This\n            kind of project needs to be evaluated more in terms of its\n            impact on public governance (and possibly decentralization)\n            issues. Land administration projects, even under more\n            simplified designs, require intensive and specialized\n            supervision. This project shows that the range of challenges\n            that emerge during implementation is very broad indeed. For\n            Bank supervision to be effective, land administration\n            project teams must include land policy and technical\n            experts, lawyers, social scientists, institutional\n            specialists, environmental specialists, and possibly others."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Land Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Land

In response to the first\n            Requesters, management states that it supports the creation\n            of a Comarca for the Naso territory. One of the Project\n            objectives provided precisely for the preparation, in\n            consultations with the Naso, of a bill and charter\n            establishing the Naso Tjer Comarca, the highest aspiration\n            of the Naso people for their territory. In response to the\n            second request management states that it agrees with the\n            second Requesters that the annex areas, which are\n            territories of the Comarca Ngobe-Bugle (created in 1997)\n            outside the Comarca's core area, were not delimited and\n            shares their concerns about this problem. Management also\n            agrees that the project \"has not fully demonstrated the\n            principle\" of informed participation and consultation\n            with respect to the delimitation of these annex areas. The\n            panel confirmed that the World Bank was aware of concerns of\n            both the Naso and the Ngobe-Bugle people since long before\n            the submission of the requests for inspection. The panel is\n            therefore satisfied that the request \"does assert that\n            the subject matter has been brought to management's\n            attention and that, in the Requesters' view, management\n            has failed to respond adequately demonstrating that it has\n            followed or is taking steps to follow the Bank's\n            policies and procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama -

Other significant modifications include: 1)\n            revising targets to better reflect the project development\n            objectives; 2) creating a new component to separate quality\n            control and monitoring activities; and 3) applying new\n            financing parameters for Panama.
