Some of the key\n            lessons learned include: strategic plans need to be\n            translated into clear action plans, which include\n            monitorable output indicators to track progress. Governments\n            might be reluctant to invest the needed time to develop such\n            action plans, particularly given the short time-frame that\n            most governments in the Latin American region face due to\n            election laws. However, experience has repeatedly shown that\n            the lack of coordination and prioritization leads to\n            inefficiencies in implementation, and slows down reform\n            implementation. Several government agencies expressed regret\n            of not having invested more time and energy into developing\n            a solid monitoring and evaluation framework. In the absence\n            of such information, there is only limited evidence to argue\n            for sustained funding and support, which makes agencies more\n            vulnerable to political shifts. Additionally, the government\n            loses an opportunity to 'market' achieved results,\n            and use the data to convince other stakeholders and involved\n            agencies of the need for reform. Available BB funds can\n            provide the needed flexibility to react to government\n            request, and maintain a close dialogue with the government\n            on selected areas of interest. While funding through a\n            technical assistance loan was available to help implement\n            some of the reforms, those funds usually are not flexible\n            enough to cover \"quick turnaround\" analysis, and\n            ongoing knowledge building support. The provision of\n            additional Bank budget funds did allow several Bank experts\n            to maintain a close contact with the government and to\n            provide targeted short-term support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - First and Second Competitiveness\n            and Public Financial Management Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - First

to the\n            Republic of Panama. This operation is the second in the\n            programmatic series that continues to support the\n            Government's program to consolidate fiscal discipline\n            and increase public sector transparency and efficiency, as\n            means for -inter alia- enhancing private sector\n            competitiveness. These two sets of objectives are mutually\n            reinforcing, as public financial management systems that\n            contribute to fiscal discipline, operational efficiency and\n            strategic allocation of resources are critical elements of\n            public sector effectiveness, which in turn can positively\n            influence the country's enabling environment for\n            private sector development. Moreover, both are critical for\n            achieving progress toward the Government of Panama\n            (GOP's) overarching objective of increasing and\n            sustaining broad-based economic growth in Panama, which\n            would in turn contribute to continued fiscal stability. The\n            medium-term outlook is not completely without risks,\n            although macroeconomic vulnerabilities in Panama have fallen\n            in recent years, as growth has accelerated, debt has\n            declined as a share of GDP, and fiscal balances have\n            improved. The proposed DPL program takes into account\n            potential risks in three areas: economic, political and\n            institutional strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Second
