Some lessons\n            learned include: infrastructure activity took the\n            lion's share of the Bank financing as well as\n            supervision efforts. If infrastructure is seen as a\n            precursor or the first sequence in reforming the judiciary,\n            then a secondary or equally important reform would be to\n            building the capacity technical, human and planning\n            capacities of the judiciary to maintain and consolidate the\n            achievements made to date. The national judicial training\n            academy has made important advances in improving the overall\n            capacity of the judges, prosecutors and supporting staff at\n            a time of rapid change in the country's legal\n            framework. Nevertheless, it must be said with the rapidly\n            evolving legal framework, consolidation of this learning and\n            the reforms will take more time than the timeframe, and is\n            subject to reversals. Finally, measuring this project's\n            success is extremely difficult given the Macedonian justice\n            sector's rapid transformation during project design and\n            implementation. It will take considerable time and resources\n            to consolidate all of the reforms set in place during\n            Project design and implementation. The project made positive\n            contributions to the implementation of new court case\n            management and bankruptcy procedures, and streamlining\n            administrative cases, and as such, the Project's\n            success should ultimately be measured with this in mind."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Legal and Judicial\n            Implementation and Institutional Support

It is\n            anticipated that remaining activities will be fully\n            completed in the eight-month extension period. Planned\n            activities that will be completed are: (i) the construction\n            period of the new Criminal Court in Skopje exceeds the\n            current closing date of the Project (July 31, 2011). Due to\n            general delays in starting this activity, and unforeseeable\n            delays at the start of the construction, including water\n            supply pipelines in the foundations, the construction was\n            delayed by a total of ten months. The anticipated completion\n            date is in January, 2012; (ii) to allow for a complete and\n            thorough analysis and final report, an extension of the\n            contract for the functional analysis from July 31, 2011, to\n            December 31, 2011, will provide the firm with sufficient\n            time to complete their analysis of the courts and for the\n            Judicial Council to test the analysis; and (iii) due to a\n            change in the management of the public administration from\n            the Ministry of Justice to the Ministry of Information\n            Technology, and the need for the Minister to familiarize\n            him/herself with the Bank's procurement rules and the\n            LJIIS project, this activity has encountered Delays. This\n            will be the first extension of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Legal and Judicial\n            Implementation and Institutional Support Project :\n            restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/03/13923804/macedonia-legal-judicial-implementation-institutional-support-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"MK-Legal & Judicial Implementation &\n            Institutional Support Project -- P089859","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Housing & Human Habitats,Gender and Law,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Gender,Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20110318002351"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Law and justice","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender,Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"borrower, court, Courts, criminal,\n            disbursement, disbursements, financial performance,\n            Information Technology, INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT, Judicial\n            Council, Justice, legislation, Loan, Minister, procurement,\n            procurement plan, public administration, will"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"60258"},"facets":{}}}
