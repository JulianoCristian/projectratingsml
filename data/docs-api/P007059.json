There is a risk that delays\n            in subloan financing will occur because the administrative\n            mechanism for channelling resources is as yet untested.\n            Agreements satisfactory to the Bank spelling out procedures\n            and responsibilities which are to be signed between Central\n            Bank and CFN and between CFN and each participating\n            intermediary should reduce this risk. Moreover, to minimize\n            further the risk, Bank staff will closely supervise the\n            project, particularly during its start-up, as well as review\n            the CFN-Central Bank administrative mechanism no later than\n            six months after loan effectiveness and revise it if necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -
