Some lessons learned included: the adoption of\n            the Performance-based Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance\n            Contract (CREMA) concept is the right first step towards an\n            improved road asset management in Bahia, but still important\n            cultural change will be necessary to reap its full benefits.\n            The State of Bahia is the pioneer, in Brazil's\n            Northeast region, in implementing performance-based road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance. The implementation of this\n            innovative modality of contracts required a cultural change,\n            which was achieved through persistent dialogue, training and\n            monitoring, at the technical and decision-making levels,\n            both for public and private (consultancies and construction\n            companies) sides, to explain the concept and ensure\n            acceptance and commitment. While this CREMA program has been\n            overall successful, project design and implementation\n            support should not understate that implementing such\n            performance-based arrangements can be challenging,\n            especially in cultures where tradition is deeply rooted and\n            risk appetite, and capabilities, from the private sector is\n            too low. In Bahia, despite dramatic progress on\n            performance-based road management, there is still a long way\n            to go to use it in its full scale. Finally, project\n            development objectives and related indicators should remain\n            commensurate to what the project activities can achieve,\n            within a strong enough causal links."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Bahia Integrated State Highway\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Bahia Integrated State\n            Highway

objective of the Bahia\n            Integrated State Highway Management Project for Brazil is to\n            increase effective use of the state road infrastructure,\n            with an aim at stimulating higher economic growth. The\n            changes aim at: 1) increasing the percentage of expenditures\n            to be financed by the Bank proceeds for the works category,\n            from currently 50 percent to tentatively 90 percent; 2)\n            reallocating funds from the unallocated category to the\n            works category; and 3) introducing a new project outcome\n            indicator. The restructuring chiefly stems from the\n            difficulty, for the Borrower, to come up with the required\n            counterpart funding, in a moment when the fiscal situation\n            of State of Bahia is constrained. Although the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) does not change, it is proposed\n            to add a third project outcome indicator and to modify one\n            project intermediate indicator. The new outcome indicator\n            would measure the reduction of average unit vehicle\n            operating costs on selected itineraries, basically the State\n            highway network under result based contracts. Almost all the\n            loan amount is already committed; disbursements of loan\n            proceeds have increased, from 8 percent in October 2009 up\n            to almost 42 percent in August
