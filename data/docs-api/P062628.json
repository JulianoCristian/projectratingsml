Significant\n            delays were experienced in complying with the effectiveness\n            conditions, namely: (i) the establishment of the project\n            coordination unit; (ii) the recruitment of a contract\n            manager for the purposes of implementing Component A: Pilot\n            Public-Private Partnership for Regional Development Planning\n            and Investment Programming which was considered a key\n            resource for the success of the project; (iii) recruitment\n            of a project account and auditors, and (iv) adoption of an\n            acceptable Project Implementation Manual. The project only\n            became effective in May 2001. Implementation was very slow\n            from the outset and it became rapidly apparent that capacity\n            was insufficient: the Project Implementation Unit was not\n            equipped to follow up contracts, take the agenda forward or\n            make reasonable progress in the execution of project\n            activities. The contract manager for Component A also\n            appeared to have insufficient capacity to implement that\n            aspect of the project, their skills being primarily in the\n            area of environmental management and land cadastre rather\n            than in the innovative regional planning approach that was\n            called for in this project. No commitment or support was\n            provided by central government for this project. Madagascar\n            constitution provides for three levels of decentralized\n            government: national, provincial and commune; in addition\n            there are legal provisions for the regional level. The\n            selected pilot regions, however, remained interested in the\n            project and became increasingly frustrated with the lack of\n            project support.  The political crisis of 2002 and the\n            change of two task managers brought additional delays to\n            project implementation. During the Country Portfolio\n            Performance Review in October 2002, the new government of\n            decided that the project was no longer a development\n            priority and acknowledged its apparent failure. On October\n            14,2002 GOM informed the Bank of its decision to close the\n            project. The Bank acknowledged Government's decision\n            and fixed June 30,2003 as the deadline for receipt of final\n            withdrawal applications. The report notes among the lessons\n            learned that the project was overly ambitious and project\n            management should have been more decentralized and the\n            components less interdependent. Also cited were task manager\n            turnover resulting in instability; and the absence-at the\n            time--of Government commitment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Public-Private
