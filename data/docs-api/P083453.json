Some lessons learned includes: the\n            sustainability of projects in countries like Guinea-Bissau\n            benefits from multiple, donor-supported interventions over a\n            lengthy period. A series of follow-up projects can be the\n            most important means for securing sustainability, and since\n            organizational and institutional capacity is generally\n            modest and the problems immense, multiple projects which\n            address 'segments' of large, complex sectors such\n            as sustainable land management, environment and\n            biodiversity, may also be the best course as reflected in\n            new, related operations Stability of the Bank and borrower\n            core teams is advantageous, albeit not easy to achieve. Such\n            stability can have major advantages over time especially for\n            technically difficult projects in troubled environments.\n            Intense and sustained supervision is entirely appropriate\n            for high-risk environments like Guinea-Bissau but does not\n            need to be costly or always direct, face-to-face encounters\n            with country counterparts. The Cufada Park experience was a\n            milestone in the Bank's relationship with the\n            Government, showing how the Bank can support the\n            country's natural resource management agenda. Poor\n            procurement performance is a serious constraint for projects\n            in Guinea-Bissau due to the lack of in-country capacity.\n            Mentoring arrangements need a formal structure with\n            guidelines on responsibilities and expected outcomes.\n            Building capacity and empowering community beneficiaries\n            through continuous 'learning by doing' which\n            extends well beyond the specific micro-project cycle is\n            prudent and innovative."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Coastal and Biodiversity\n
