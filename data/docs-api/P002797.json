Nonetheless,\n            preparation of the project conduced to the resettlement\n            plan, implemented between May 1998 and May 2000, when both\n            urban, and rural resettlement occurred along the pipeline\n            route. Volume I specifies the resettlement plan, noting that\n            in the absence of clear legal, and regulatory standards in\n            Tanzania, the Bank's Operational Directive 4.30 should\n            guide the process to minimize disruption, either through the\n            way-of-leave program (WOLP) (cash compensations), or\n            resettlement. The WOLP determined land values (including\n            housing, structures, and crops) according to market value,\n            with the provision of alternative plots of land, if\n            allocation is less than half an acre, and, a Dispute\n            Resolution Group was established to settle potential\n            conflicts. The Resettlement process provided land-for-land\n            compensation at replacement costs, including crop losses, to\n            restore living standards of displaced populations. Volume II\n            presents a resettlement impact assessment, followed by a\n            socioeconomic assessment program, that reviews the process,\n            and, includes the provision to restore infrastructure\n            services in urban areas, to at least equivalent to the\n            levels of services prior to resettlement, in light of lesser\n            service levels experienced.

In the health\n            area, a strategy for dealing with HIV/AIDS will be developed\n            for the entire project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental audit of 18 substations"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Songo Songo Gas\n            Development & Power Generation Project : environmental\n            impact assessment (Vol. 4) : Environmental audit of 18 substations"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/11/6630930/tanzania-songo-songo-gas-development-power-generation-project-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-4-environmental-audit-18-substations","projn":"TZ-Songo Gas Dev & Power Gen (Fy02) -- P002797","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Tanzania","authors":{"authr":"Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060302114823"},"subsc":"Power,Central government administration,Other social services,Oil and gas","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Air quality; Coastal areas; Employment;\n            Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management;\n            Fisheries; Land use; Marine environment; Methane; Pipelines;\n            Power plants; Property rights; Resettlement; Water quality;\n            Water resources; Wildlife; Conservation; Forest management;\n            Erosion control; Solid waste management; Air pollution\n            control; Emissions control; Gas leakage; Emergency response\n            to accidents; Disease control; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Air quality; Coastal areas; Employment;\n            Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management;\n            Fisheries; Land use; Marine environment; Methane; Pipelines;\n            Power plants; Property rights; Resettlement; Water quality;\n            Water resources; Wildlife; Conservation; Forest management;\n            Erosion control; Solid waste management; Air pollution\n            control; Emissions control; Gas leakage; Emergency response\n            to accidents; Disease control; Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020791-OIL & NATURAL GAS RELATED ACTIVITIES,TF020783-SONGO SONGO GAS DEV. &\n            POWER GENERATION,TF038754-TANZANIA - SUPERVISION OF SONGO\n            SONGO GAS-TO-ELECTRICITY PROJECT - ENVI,TF031343-TANZANIA - SONGO SONGO GAS PROJECT,TF031136-AFRICA- NATURAL GAS (TANZANIA\n            & MOZAMBIQUE)","repnb":"E65"},"facets":{}}}
