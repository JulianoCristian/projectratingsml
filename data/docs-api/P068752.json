Some lessons\n            learned includes: international independent audit of current\n            traffic volumes and projected traffic growth. This project\n            has highlighted the optimistic estimation of current traffic\n            and estimated traffic growth; a major economic factor in the\n            evaluation of the viability of transport infrastructure.\n            Reduced and more focused use of international supervision\n            consultants for the shorter, more specific or specialized\n            technical tasks. The contribution of the international\n            consultant (IC) was mainly related to project management\n            support and training. Proper soil compaction or\n            consolidation, adequate drainage and sufficient insulation\n            must all be considered at design stage in order for a road\n            to survive long winters. Design of projects should also take\n            into consideration climate changes which could mean higher\n            rainfall and colder winter temperatures. Further efforts\n            needed to overcome institutional barriers and achieve better\n            coordination across department involved in road transport.\n            The inclusion of reform or policy related issues within a\n            project often face problems because their implementation\n            often falls outside the jurisdiction of the implementation\n            institution.

Avoid discharging asphalt\n            smoke and locate asphalt and lime-mixing plants downwind;\n            Minimize noise of road building machines by locating\n            machinery away from residential areas, and repair and\n            maintain machinery and equipment. Adopt cofferdam method to\n            effectively prevent turbid water quality, and prevent\n            pollution from construction waste falling into rivers.\n            Collect and treat machine oil and prevent discharge into\n            water bodies. Cover the stack sites for construction with\n            canvas. Domestic sewage produced from the construction\n            camping sites should be centrally treaded, and excrement and\n            urine may be compost-treated and then become a fertilizer\n            for grasslands. Otherwise bury non-hazardous solid waste in\n            pits.   Other measures include traffic safety, preventing\n            vehicle overload, hazardous waste disposal management,\n            controlling speed minimizing horn blowing, following exhaust\n            emission standards, and operating drainage facilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The local road improvement program in Inner\n            Mongolia : Genhe to Mangui section"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Inner Mongolia Transport\n            and Transport Facilitation Project : environmental\n            evaluation report and environmental action plan (Vol. 4) :\n            The local road improvement program in Inner Mongolia : Genhe\n            to Mangui section"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/05/7694852/china-inner-mongolia-transport-transport-facilitation-project-environmental-evaluation-report-environmental-action-plan-vol-4-local-road-improvement-program-inner-mongolia-genhe-mangui-section","projn":"CN-Inner Mongolia Highway And Trade Corridor\n            -- P068752","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Wetlands,Environmental Economics & Policies,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Environment,Transport,Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Inner Mongolia Environmental Sciences Academy"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070607105321"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Transport,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Ecological impact;

Collection and\n            treatment of oil machines should be practiced, thus\n            preventing discharges into water bodies.
