Companies in\n            FYR Macedonia faced many challenges, such as an inefficient\n            and unresponsive bureaucracy, significant regulatory\n            burdens, and a weak judicial system resulting in increased\n            costs and time of doing business.

The World\n            Bank's Business Environment Reform and Institutional\n            Strengthening project focused on cutting the red tape and\n            bureaucracy hurdles for the enterprises.
