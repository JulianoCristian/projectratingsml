Some lessons learned included: tax law does\n            not operate in a vacuum and often has unintended\n            consequences, which the tax agency can help elucidate for\n            lawmakers. The experience in Guatemala indicates that\n            lawmakers are often unaware of the multiple ramifications of\n            seemingly innocuous changes to the tax law. The technical\n            assessment of the impact of such changes on the part of the\n            ministry of finance and Superintendency of Tax\n            Administration (SAT) should be a crucial input in the\n            legislative process. Institutional factors that can hinder\n            the sustainability of tax administration reforms include:\n            resistance to change that is ingrained in most\n            bureaucracies, lack of top management support, and lack of\n            continuity in top management. Political factors that can\n            hinder the sustainability of tax administration reforms\n            include: pressure from powerful vested interests, lack of\n            understanding on the part of lawmakers, and, of course, lack\n            of political will. Creating mechanisms to channel input from\n            taxpayers, businesses, and other stakeholders is another\n            critical step toward building a community-based tax system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Tax Administration Technical\n            Assistance Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Tax Administration\n            Technical Assistance Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/11/9784261/guatemala-tax-administration-technical-assistance-loan-project","projn":"GT-Tax Admin.
