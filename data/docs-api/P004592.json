The lessons learned\n            from this project include: 1) The demand-driven,\n            \"bottom-up\" project structure proved to be a most\n            effective and efficient means of harnessing local government\n            unit (LGU) participation. 2) The presence of national\n            support mechanisms is instrumental to achieving project\n            success. 3) Limited availability of funds at the local level\n            points toward the need for comprehensive revenue enhancement\n            and mobilization for LGUs. 4) Grants should be targeted to\n            induce LGUs to consider investments in areas they do not\n            traditionally address such as social and environmental\n            projects. 5) The Bank's recent success with the City\n            Development Strategy (CDS) supports the finding that a\n            long-term vision is more effective when it is backed with ad\n            development strategy. 6) Local political commitment is\n            essential to ensuring project success and sustainability. 7)\n            The Municipal Development Fund Office must be made more\n            responsive to the needs of LGUs. 8) Improved fiscal\n            performance goes hand-in-hand with management strengthening.\n            9) Small projects lead to bigger ones. 10) Capacity building\n            for LGUs should go beyond the traditional classroom training\n            mode utilized in this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Third Municipal Development
