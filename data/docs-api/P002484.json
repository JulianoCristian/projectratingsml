The objectives of SMRAPP were to: (i) further\n            refine and improve Semi-Mechanized Rainfed Farming System\n            (SMR) farming technology through on-site adaptive research\n            and trials; (ii) develop an independent and self sustaining\n            organizational structure to manage the SMR activities for\n            replication elsewhere in Somalia; and (iii) within the pilot\n            area, increase crop and livestock production and incomes.\n            The major lessons learned over the short duration of project\n            implementation are: (a) a centralized approach is likely to\n            encounter difficulties in securing farmer participation;\n            increased participation in selection of land for individual\n            cultivation, and in planting decisions might generate a\n            greater response; (b) the use of a menu of options in a\n            pilot project of this nature might facilitate the\n            identification of approaches most viable under local\n            conditions; and (c) cost recovery may need to be phased in\n            as the benefits of the technology are demonstrated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Somalia -
