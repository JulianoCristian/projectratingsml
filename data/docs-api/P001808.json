Mining may cause\n            pollution to water, to air and the contamination of soils\n            and sediment, hence laboratories need to be able to analyze\n            solid, liquid, and gaseous samples. It is foreseen that the\n            Department of Environment shall require analytical services,\n            both for the control of discharges from mines, and for the\n            determination of background conditions in various natural\n            environments. The analysis for mercury related to\n            contamination from artisanal mining is a possible future\n            need, if Mozambican authorities decide to embark on an\n            investigation of this potentially serious problem. This\n            would mean the analysis for mercury in such media as natural\n            soils; stream sediments; water (less likely as the\n            solubility of mercury in water is extremely low); fish (or\n            other fauna); and, human hair and blood. Such analyses\n            requires sophisticated equipment to determine expected low\n            concentrations, as well as strict routines for cleanliness,\n            and inter-laboratory quality control. The inefficient use of\n            natural resources creates the following potential problems:\n            incomplete recovery of ore reserves in mine or deposit; poor\n            recovery of metals/minerals in the beneficiation process;\n            and, wastefulness regarding consumption of water and energy.\n            Sources or reasons for this are the use of unsuitable mining\n            methods, inferior beneficial methods, and/or poor\n            optimization of processes, slack management and work\n            routines. Recommendations include implementation of baseline\n            studies in regions where future mining is expected to take\n            place, or in areas of ecological sensitivity. It is\n            suggested to study groundwater conditions, as well as the\n            vegetation characteristics of coastal areas hosting deposits\n            of titanium-rich heavy mineral sands. In addition,\n            guidelines for occupational health and safety matters at\n            mining sites should be developed, in close cooperation with\n            the Department of Mine Safety."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Mineral Resources Management\n            Capacity Building Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Mineral Resources\n            Management Capacity Building Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/5255797/mozambique-mineral-resources-management-capacity-building-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"MZ-Mineral Resources Management Capacity\n            Building Project -- P001808","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Sanitation and Sewerage,Cultural Heritage & Preservation,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy)","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment","count":"Mozambique","authors":{"authr":"Impacto Projetos e Estudos Ambientais;\n            Swedish Geological AB"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20041102103641"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acid drainage, acid rock drainage,\n            Agriculture, Air pollution, air quality, air quality\n            standards, alkalinity, artisanal mining, audits, bauxite,\n            beneficiation, biodiversity, Biological Sciences, BOD,\n            calcium, channels, chloride, coal, coal mines, coal mining,\n            coastal areas, conductivity, conservation, Consultation,\n            contaminants, contamination of soils, discharge, drinking\n            water, drinking water quality, dry season, dust, economic\n            conditions, economic development, economic factors,\n            Economics, efficient use, emission, emission standards,\n            Employment, environmental evaluation, Environmental Impact,\n            Environmental Impact Assessment, environmental issues,\n            Environmental Law, environmental management, environmental\n            performance, environmental policies, environmental\n            protection, environmental quality, environmental\n            regulations, environmental sciences, exploitation, farmers,\n            Fe, financial resources, Forestry, gases, gemstones,\n            geology, GNP, good practice, Gross national product,\n            hardness, Human Development, Hydrocarbons, income,\n            industrial minerals, institutional reform, land reclamation,\n            land use, Land Use Planning, large scale mining,\n            Legislation, mercury, methane, Mine Closure, Mine Safety,\n            mine sites, mineral exploration, Mineral Resources, mineral\n            rights, Mines, Mining, mining companies, mining concessions,\n            Mining Engineering, mining engineers, Mining Law, mining\n            operations, Mining Sector, Mining Technology, national\n            parks, natural resources, nitrogen, Noise, oil, open pit\n            mining, oxidation, particulates, permits, pH, pH values,\n            pollution, pollution abatement, potable water, productivity,\n            Prospecting, quality control, Quarrying, Radioactivity,\n            rainfall, Rural Development, Safety, sediment, silica, small\n            scale mining, Soil pollution, solid waste, suspended solids,\n            sustainable development, Technical Assistance, Temperature,\n            toxic metals, turbidity, urban areas, vibration, water\n            quality, water samples, Water use, waters, wetlands"}},"owner":"Oil, Gas and Mining (SEGOM)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF020600-FINNISH GENERAL CONSULTANT\n            TRUST FUND,TF025952-PHRD-MINERAL RESOURCES\n            MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BLDG.
