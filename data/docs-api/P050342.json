Some\n            lessons learned included: investing in women's\n            development is a worthwhile goal. Success or failure depends\n            on the identification, design, and relevance of a project.\n            Collaboration of the local administrative officials plays an\n            important role for the success of women's economic,\n            social, and political empowerment. Success depends on mutual\n            understanding between the Regional Coordinating Units\n            (RCUs), Facilitators, and Intermediaries. Training and\n            Information, Education and Communication (IEC) on legal\n            awareness and harmful practices are important and effective.\n            Tracking of a project's strengths and weaknesses\n            requires a simple but comprehensive and participatory\n            monitoring system; and attribution of the impacts to a\n            project requires a sound impact evaluation methodology. It\n            is possible to empower poor, illiterate women socially and\n            economically through small-scale and group-based\n            micro-business initiatives.

The study assesses the\n            empowerment status of Ethiopian women in both rural and\n            urban areas, and evaluates the impact of participation in\n            WDIP on women's empowerment. Empowerment status and\n            impact are measured against indicators in the economic,\n            political, social, and psychological domains, on the\n            assumption that WDIP, a project designed to expand economic\n            opportunities, strengthen self-reliance, and build\n            awareness, will affect outcomes in all these spheres. WDIP\n            is a community-driven development project that seeks to\n            enhance women's empowerment and participation in\n            development interventions by mobilizing women at the\n            grassroots level and capitalizing on their potential to\n            support development processes. WDIP seeks to redress gender\n            imbalances in development opportunity by investing in\n            women's skills, productivity, and organizational\n            capacity. This report is structured as follows: section one\n            gives introduction. Section two outlines the objective and\n            conceptual framework. Section three presents research design\n            and methodology. Section four focuses on analysis of\n            women's empowerment and the determinants of\n            empowerment. Section five presents impact evaluation of WDIP."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Measuring women's empowerment and the\n            impact of Ethiopia's women's development\n            initiatives
