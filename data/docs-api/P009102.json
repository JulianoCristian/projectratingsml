Despite its third\n            restructuring, and its unsatisfactory rating, it is fair to\n            say that overall project implementation period, only took\n            four years, comparatively short for a Technical Assistance\n            Loan, in addition to the fact that TALs often, and\n            repeatedly extend their closing dates. Nonetheless, the\n            absence of most of the privatization benchmarks, the slow\n            loan utilization, an overly ambitious design, and the\n            failure to visualize that the functional relationship\n            between the Privatization Administration (PA), and the\n            Privatization High Council (PHC), could jeopardize the\n            implementation of the privatization program, hindered\n            success. The lessons indicate that the slow progress in\n            privatization was mostly of a political, and institutional\n            nature, thus a strong government commitment to an agreed\n            privatization strategy, should have been a condition for\n            Board presentation. Given the existing legal framework, and\n            the ability of the PHC to guide the PA through regulations,\n            and directives, its involvement in decision-making on\n            privatization transactions, should only have taken place for\n            the transfer of the State Owned Economic Enterprise to the\n            PA privatization portfolio, and, for its approval. In\n            addition, and for efficiency matters, the PA should be\n            reorganized, focusing on policy formulation, process\n            management, and monitoring, and
