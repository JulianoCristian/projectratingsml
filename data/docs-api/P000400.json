Lessons learned include the following: Civil\n            servants should not be given a pivotal role in community\n            micro-finance management. Implementation of similar\n            activities in future projects should be handled by private\n            nongovernmental organizations or other local organizations;\n            local civil servants should have only a peripheral role.\n            Decentralizing most management responsibilities can have a\n            stimulating impact on project outreach; the involvement of\n            many participants at the regional level has created strong\n            ownership and left considerable experience and expertise at\n            decentralized levels for similar operations in the future.\n            Project monitoring, for the most part, was not well\n            organized. The project's not having an independent\n            impact evaluation system led to difficulties in assessing\n            the impacts of various components components. Intensive and\n            broad-based training is a pre-condition for adequate field\n            implementation performance. A consistent and homogenous\n            supervision team is needed on the Borrower and the Bank\n            sides. The absence of interest rates on micro-credits was\n            one of the weakest points in the project's design.\n            Micro-credits repaid by communities must be recycled\n            rapidly. A sustained participatory process can breed\n            innovations, create ownership, and build capacities at the\n            community level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Food Security Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon -
