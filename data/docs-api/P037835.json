Lessons address\n            particularly, institutional reforms and the complexity of\n            the program. The technical and political difficulties of\n            implementation were under-estimated, which resulted in an\n            overly optimistic pace at which success could be achieved.\n            Failure to fully recognize that political considerations can\n            overwhelm technical, and capacity issues, result in programs\n            being designed and supported even when probability of\n            success is very low. This factor partly explains the\n            continued funding under the project, despite poor progress\n            on governance issues. If political factors are well-defined,\n            then the process of program design, its appropriateness and\n            the likelihood of its success will not only be transparent,\n            but will also enable a clearer crafting of roles,\n            responsibilities, and accountabilities, of both borrowers\n            and donors. Given a weak implementation capacity, project\n            designs should be simple and modest in their scope,\n            involving fewer components and executing agencies. The\n            extensive agenda detracted focus from the core reforms,\n            particularly of the institutional variety, that were\n            critical for sustainability. Moreover, not only is it\n            difficult to apply conditionalities to complex institutional\n            issues that are generally critical for achieving longer term\n            sustainability, but institutional reforms in the social\n            sectors are difficult to implement in isolation without\n            addressing the issue of poor governance, and without\n            undertaking fundamental institutional reforms in the\n            government as a whole. Further lessons address capacity\n            constraints, poor coordination, management and monitoring,\n            and, issues related to future support for the social sector reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Social Action Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Social Action\n            Program
