restructuring program of industrial corporations on a\n            selective basis. The project is conceived as a pilot effort\n            that will be replicative in restructuring efforts carried on\n            outside the project. The project will include assistance\n            for: (a) establishing and financing the institutional\n            framework through which corporate restructurings will be\n            devised, negotiated, and implemented; and (b) financing the\n            purchase of capital goods and working capital necessary to\n            maintain and increase production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Industrial Finance Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile - Industrial Finance\n            Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/05/741831/chile-industrial-finance-restructuring-project","projn":"CL-Industrial Sector -- P006607","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Chile","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970723102732"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other finance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Administrative Procedures,asset\n            prices,Auditing,balance of payments,Banking Law,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,Banks,bonds,book value,borrowing,capital\n            gains,capital goods,car,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,Consumer Price Index,CPI,debt,demand\n            deposits,denominated\n            loans,depositors,devaluation,dividends,economic\n            activity,economic growth,Economic Rate of Return,economic\n            resources,economic\n            situation,employment,equilibrium,equilibrium prices,equity\n            capital,Exchange rate,expenditures,exports,financial\n            assets,financial crisis,financial distress,Financial\n            Institutions,financial markets,financial resources,financial\n            restructuring,Financial Sector,fiscal policies,Fiscal\n            Year,fishing,foreign banks,foreign exchange,GDP,Gross\n            Domestic Product,growth potential,holding companies,import\n            tariffs,imports,inflation,insurance,interest rate,Interest\n            rates,international banks,legislation,lending\n            institutions,liquidation,liquidity,market\n            economies,maturities,mortgages,mutual\n            funds,overvaluation,ownership structure,private banks,real\n            interest\n            rate,savings,Securities,shareholders,subsidiaries,Subsidiary,tax\n            revenues,Technical Assistance,trade\n            balance,trading,warrants,working capital,writeoffs"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Administrative Procedures,asset\n            prices,Auditing,balance of payments,Banking Law,banking\n            system,bankruptcy,Banks,bonds,book value,borrowing,capital\n            gains,capital goods,car,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,Consumer Price Index,CPI,debt,demand\n            deposits,denominated\n            loans,depositors,devaluation,dividends,economic\n            activity,economic growth,Economic Rate of Return,economic\n            resources,economic\n            situation,employment,equilibrium,equilibrium prices,equity\n            capital,Exchange rate,expenditures,exports,financial\n            assets,financial crisis,financial distress,Financial\n            Institutions,financial markets,financial resources,financial\n            restructuring,Financial Sector,fiscal policies,Fiscal\n            Year,fishing,foreign banks,foreign exchange,GDP,Gross\n            Domestic Product,growth potential,holding companies,import\n            tariffs,imports,inflation,insurance,interest rate,Interest\n            rates,international banks,legislation,lending\n            institutions,liquidation,liquidity,market\n            economies,maturities,mortgages,mutual\n            funds,overvaluation,ownership structure,private banks,real\n            interest\n            rate,savings,Securities,shareholders,subsidiaries,Subsidiary,tax\n            revenues,Technical Assistance,trade\n            balance,trading,warrants,working capital,writeoffs"}},"owner":"WB Off:Buenos Aires-Southrn Cone (LCC7C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"5433"},"facets":{}}}
