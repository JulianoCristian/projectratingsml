Where these changes span new technical systems,\n            functional roles and responsibilities, and multiple\n            stakeholder agencies there is a need to ensure that such\n            reforms are introduced at a pace that they can be absorbed\n            and accepted. Fundamental aspect of a functioning road\n            management system is having both the technical capacity and\n            financial resources to ensure regular and reliable data\n            collection for monitoring and evaluating performance.\n            Long-term strategic planning provides an important platform\n            for communicating a sectoral vision to stakeholders. Going\n            forward, the Ministry of Transport can build on this\n            approach by updating the ten year strategy for road\n            maintenance to address future institutional and policy\n            goals, defining the role of small and medium enterprises in\n            the maintenance sector, and setting and measuring network\n            performance targets and fiscal projections, all of which can\n            contribute to better sector governance and facilitate donor\n            engagement. Capacity development for land acquisition and\n            resettlement remain paramount for improving implementation\n            performance. Both Vietnam and the Bank must intensify their\n            efforts to refining country systems for land acquisition and\n            resettlement. The Bank task team should also be proactive in\n            advising relevant government officials on appropriate\n            solutions to meeting Bank safeguard requirements,\n            particularly where complex local conditions make policy\n            compliance difficult to achieve. The existing project\n            management unit structure misses opportunities to mainstream\n            roles and responsibilities into relevant Ministerial\n            departments. Various governance challenges exist within this\n            organizational structure and may actually present an\n            obstacle to improving public sector performance in\n            infrastructure service delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -

This resettlement action\n            plan (RAP) provides the policy framework for compensation,\n            resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons, as a\n            result of project implementation, in compliance with the\n            country's legal and regulatory policies, and the\n            Bank's guidelines on resettlement.

Compensation payments will be awarded at\n            replacement costs, while land for land arrangements will be\n            made, unless replacement land is unavailable, or, at the\n            informed request of the displaced person (DP), cash\n            compensation may be provided. Different subsidy allowances\n            and other forms of assistance are also available to\n            different categories of DP. Severely affected DP will be\n            entitled to food aid, and/or training and income restoration\n            programs, available through the District Agricultural\n            Extension Office, and other relevant offices.
