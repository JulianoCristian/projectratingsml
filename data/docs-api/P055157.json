Some\n            lessons learned included: monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) frameworks should be well developed at the time of\n            project effectiveness. Several aspects of the HSRP M&E\n            framework lacked a clear link to project activities, and it\n            was made in the absence of good baseline data. Surveys\n            undertaken during project effectiveness were not consistent,\n            making it difficult to compare data over time. A simple\n            insistence on using the same core questionnaire in each\n            survey from start to finish will be a big step forward.\n            Although Bank-financed projects can not always be\n            coordinated with election cycles, starting an ambitious\n            health reform project less than one year before an election\n            is fraught with risk. To the extent possible, reform\n            projects should be mindful of electoral considerations.\n            There are valuable synergies between investment operations\n            and Development Policy Loans (DPLs) that should be exploited\n            wherever feasible. Investment projects can open policy\n            dialogue and build trust as a precursor to policy-based\n            lending, as well as finance Technical Assistance (TA) that\n            can inform DPL activities once they are operational. DPLs\n            can help shape the policy environment to maximize the return\n            to a traditional project's investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Health Sector Reform

Four of\n            the seven projects components are financed by the World\n            Bank.

The second component\n            helps implement reform of the hospital system, including\n            funding hospital information systems, financing a health\n            reform investment program, and funding a labor adjustment\n            strategy to transition surplus hospital staff. The third\n            component assists the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF)\n            to establish the technological infrastructure to operate the\n            insurance system, including the hardware and software\n            systems needed as well as the training and technical\n            assistance required.
