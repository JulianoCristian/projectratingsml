Key lessons address the following. Like\n            many of the first generation of projects in the transition\n            countries, the project design was fairly complex, and, to a\n            large extent, the rationale for the high complexity derives\n            from the comprehensive set of recommendations included in\n            the Bank's report \"Human Resources and the\n            Transition to a Market Economy in Romania\". While the\n            statement that a less ambitious project design would have\n            allowed an easier and faster implementation may be accepted,\n            it would be fair to say that in the end, the efforts paid\n            off, since all the project development objectives were\n            satisfactorily achieved. Donors involvement in project\n            preparation strongly helped the process, and secured as well\n            a significant amount of valuable technical assistance,\n            delivered during implementation, on a grant basis, for the\n            development of employment services, adult training, career\n            counseling, and active labor market measures. Stakeholders\n            participation (trade unions and employers associations) was\n            also highly helpful in building consensus, and ensuring\n            active support and participation during project\n            implementation. However, the coordination of the large\n            number of implementing agencies (Government and\n            non-Government) involved in implementing the various project\n            components, placed a heavy burden on the Project Unit,\n            particularly at the early stages, when the consultative\n            process was still not definitely established."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania

The specific objectives of the project are\n            to: 1) strengthen the capacity of labor offices to\n            administer increasing numbers of claims for unemployment\n            benefits and active labor adjustment services (e.g. job\n            placement, employment counseling, training); 2) develop a\n            flexible adult training system which responds to evolving\n            labor market demand resulting from economic restructuring;\n            and 3) implement reforms in social insurance and assistance\n            programs, targeting those population groups which are most\n            vulnerable to falling into poverty during and after the\n            transition to a market economy. Project components include:\n            1) General management and policy including monitoring and\n            policy analysis of new programs, automation of labor and\n            social protection offices to support and improve the\n            management of programs to be introduced, and project\n            management support to expand and strengthen the already\n            functioning

The specific objectives of the project are\n            to: 1) strengthen the capacity of labor offices to\n            administer increasing numbers of claims for unemployment\n            benefits and active labor adjustment services (e.g. job\n            placement, employment counseling, training); 2) develop a\n            flexible adult training system which responds to evolving\n            labor market demand resulting from economic restructuring;\n            and 3) implement reforms in social insurance and assistance\n            programs, targeting those population groups which are most\n            vulnerable to falling into poverty during and after the\n            transition to a market economy. Project components include:\n            1) General management and policy including monitoring and\n            policy analysis of new programs, automation of labor and\n            social protection offices to support and improve the\n            management of programs to be introduced, and project\n            management support to expand and strengthen the already\n            functioning Project Coordination Unit established under the\n            Technical Assistance and Critical Imports (TACI) Project; 2)\n            employment and training which comprises employment services,\n
