Institutional\n            development impact is rated modest. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated unsatisfactory. Three\n            lessons learned were: 1) The promotion of biodiversity\n            protection needs to take the political dimension into\n            account and plan and provide for building alliances in\n            support of needed reforms of the system. Lacking internal\n            and external support, many of the studies, recommendations,\n            and proposals produced by the project did not result in\n            action by the implementing agency. 2) Realistic objectives,\n            clear benchmarks, and sound monitoring are crucial to ensure\n            that project activities contribute to strategic goals. 3)\n            Excessive complexity was one of the project's major\n            flaws.

The lessons drawn from this\n            project include: 1) The project was designed to improve an\n            organization that had been given a role and a legal\n            structure without having had experience on the ground. A\n            project coordination unit was mandated to perform this task\n            form within Ecuadorean Institute of Agrarian Reform\n            Institute, of Forestry, Natural Areas and Wildlife (INEFAN).\n            This was the root of poor ownership of the project by\n            INEFAN. 2) The involvement of communities in the planning\n            and implementation of sustainable resource management and\n            biodiversity protection was shown to be important. 3) The\n            collaboration between public authorities and the NGOs and\n            bilateral communities is important. However, the project\n            failed to bring these interests together at the central\n            level. An explicit process should be included in the\n            project's basic design, with resources identified as\n            needed to make this effective at all levels. 4) The\n            monitoring

outreach activities inclusive of\n            community participation and raising of public awareness; and\n            4) investment activities which will provide financing for\n            civil
