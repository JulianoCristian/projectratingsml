Some lessons learned included:\n            technical assistance loans are a good complement to\n            Programmatic lending. The Brazilian government's strong\n            commitment to financial sector reform and the Bank's\n            extensive work in preparing the programmatic loans\n            facilitated the design of the FSTAL and its focus on\n            supporting institutional development needs of the principal\n            financial sector regulatory agencies. High capacity\n            countries like Brazil need Technical Assistance (TA) loans\n            to support institutional strengthening, but the projects\n            have to be focused on the needs of the beneficiary. In the\n            case of Brazilian Central Bank (BCB), their interest was\n            mostly in hardware and software to upgrade essential\n            components of the payments system and in training programs\n            for banking examiners. Brazilian Securities and Exchange\n            Commission (CVM) needs were concentrated in the operational\n            areas of enforcement, inspections, surveillance, and\n            financial and accounting norms. TA projects should have a\n            short duration with active Bank participation. The project\n            timeline should define the scope of activities. Simpler,\n            shorter and possibly more frequent projects may result in\n            better outcomes over time. TA loans should be stressed as an\n            important part of the Bank's economic development mission."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Loan

The two\n            main components will: 1) provide support in addressing\n            systemic financial sector issues, by reinforcing banking\n            supervision, through the Central Bank. Included is the\n            support for the payments system reform, through policy\n            advice on risk control management, operational upgrading,\n            and development of an efficient government securities\n            market. Banking supervision will be strengthened, through a\n            combination of studies, information technology upgrade,\n            policy formulation, and training assistance. In addition,\n            improvements in the banking system safety net will be\n            supported, through a revision of bank failure resolution\n            rules, initiation of contingency planning, and improved\n            monitoring of bank interventions; and, 2) strengthen\n            regulation, and compliance, and, increase transparency and\n            investor protection in the area of securities markets, by\n            supporting the Brazilian Securities Commission - CVM.\n            Specifically, diagnostic work will propose options on the\n            role, responsibilities, and resources of the CVM. Included\n            is the revision of the regulatory framework in terms of\n            governance, accounting techniques expected under the revised\n            Corporate and Securities Laws, improved market surveillance,\n            and strengthened disclosure, and investor protection.\n            Technical assistance, training, and information technology\n            will support capacity building of both the Central Bank, and CVM."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -
