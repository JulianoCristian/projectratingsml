There are four main\n            project components. The first improves the quality of\n            education by expanding pre-service teacher training\n            programs; revitalizing the network of teacher support zones;\n            transforming the curriculum for grades 1-7 to reflect\n            integration of the educational cycles and materials, and to\n            promote values and sensitization to national culture and\n            regional diversity; supplying textbooks and teaching\n            materials; improving classroom assessments and examinations;\n            providing grants for quality improvement; and training\n            school directors. The second component increases access to\n            education and improves equity by expanding the number of\n            places and supporting girls' education initiatives as\n            well as improving non-formal education and special\n            education. The third component strengthens the institutional\n            capacity of the education ministry in organizational\n            structure, policy and planning, financial management, and\n            monitoring and evaluation. The fourth component funds\n            development of a strategy for operating the technical and\n            vocational systems and for enhancing quality and efficiency\n            in higher education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Education Sector Strategic\n            Program Project (ESSP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Education Sector\n            Strategic
