The Project faced severe constraints\n            associated with the economic, epidemiologic, and natural\n            environment. Some key lessons were drawn from the project\n            implementation. 1) The application of targeting criteria\n            responded well to the fiscal constraints. 2) Pilot testing\n            is appropriate at early stages of policy implementation. 3)\n            Public-private partnerships are effective in micronutrient\n            fortification programs. 4) Municipal government, community\n            involvement, and innovative counterpart arrangements can\n            buffer the project from economic shocks. 5) Emergencies can\n            bring about better implementation results if coupled with\n            good technical and implementation capabilities. 6)\n            Continuity in Bank task management helps to reduce the\n            impact of turnover on the Borrower side. 7) Project\n            activities that imply a significant recurrent cost burden\n            should be reassessed - and possibly redesigned - in light of\n            new economic conditions. 8) The development of an emergency\n            services network yielded high returns. 9) Program management\n            experience and continuity is essential at all stages of\n            implementation, and can ensure timely execution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -
