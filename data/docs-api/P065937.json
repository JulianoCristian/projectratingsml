Some\n            lessons learned included: specialized (private) operators\n            are the preferred approach for medium-size cities: after\n            decades of stagnation in improving water service in\n            medium-sized cities, the project demonstrated that under the\n            right circumstances a private operator can significantly\n            improve water services. National Government's Technical\n            Assistance Program is critical: the Departmental Water Plans\n            (PDA) represents the second generation national government\n            policy initiative to promote and consolidate private\n            operators by channeling resources through and assigning more\n            sector responsibility to the departments. Operator selection\n            process needs to be refined: The original project concept of\n            awarding concession contracts based on the lowest cost\n            subsidy was theoretically sound, but did not work well in\n            practice. Need to better incorporate technical dimensions\n            into performance goals and investment plans: a number of\n            common technical issues were encountered which hindered\n            improvements in service, including: inadequate raw water\n            supply sources, frequent power outages, high levels of\n            unaccounted for water, low levels of micro-metering, and\n            lack of attention to network sectorization. Wastewater and\n            storm water drainage policies and programs need to be\n            developed: the expansion of sewerage coverage under the\n            project was minimal and none of the project municipalities\n            have wastewater treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -

It was\n            among the forerunners of decentralization. It established a\n            legal framework that clearly separates service provision\n            from policy making, thus allowing private sector\n            participation. The key to success in the Colombian water\n            sector reform has been the development of homegrown\n            solutions, and at times, skillfully adapting models used\n            elsewhere to the particular circumstances and culture of\n            Colombia. As a result, Colombia has made substantial\n            progress in the expansion of water supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) services. By 2002, urban water supply access was 99\n            percent, rural water supply coverage 71 percent. Sanitation\n            access has also been upgraded with urban coverage of 96\n            percent and rural coverage of 54 percent.

The\n            components will achieve those objectives by: 1) providing\n            financial support to the public sector funding requirements\n            of the water sector, and sanitation infrastructure in\n            medium, and small size cities within Colombia's\n            Caribbean region, ensuring the execution of respective\n            works. Investments from Government counterpart funding will\n            finance water supply civil works, and equipment in medium,\n            and small cities located outside the Caribbean region, as an\n            integral part of the project. Private sector participation\n            will commit to provide a portion of their annual Law 60\n            income, to finance construction works, and operation of\n            water utilities, of which a portion may be recovered from\n            tariff incomes; 2) strengthening the sector environmental\n            management capacity, through advisory services, namely for\n            water quality, and effluent discharge regulations, and to\n            define environmental requirements, and methodologies.\n            Training programs will be sponsored, and, public\n            consultations will focus on defining the criteria for water\n            and sanitation services; 3) providing technical assistance\n            (TA) for the development of rural water, and sanitation\n            sector policy, strategy, and methods for an incremental\n            coverage in the area; and, 4) providing project management\n            costs, training, and TA to incorporate the private sector in\n            the management, and operation of participating water, and\n            sanitation utilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Water Sector Reform

environmental policies,\n            institutional framework, and instruments for an integral\n            environmental management in the water sector, highlighted in\n            Chapters 1-6, and, recommends a series of actions towards\n            institutional strengthening. It then looks at the potential\n            environmental adversity resulting from the implementation of\n            the Water Sector Reform Assistance Project, and proposes\n            mitigating measures as follows. Soil erosion, and land, and\n            water degradation will occur as a result of excavations,\n            affecting particularly slope terrains: land leveling, and\n            vegetation propagation will minimize those effects;\n            agricultural land losses, will be compensated with terraced\n            land plots, of high agricultural productivity; appropriate\n            drainage, and watershed management will minimize water\n            concentration in sanitary landfills; similarly, solid waste\n            disposal will be treated to prevent soil, and groundwater\n            contamination; additionally, ditches will be constructed to\n            reduce water losses, and contamination, and will contribute\n            as well to the preservation of aquifers; vegetative\n            propagation practices will be undertaken in, and around\n            construction areas to reduce soil erosion, and air\n            pollution; dry areas will require the use of small\n            reservoirs to contain water, to be discharged through\n            adequate drainage systems; conversely, in flooded areas,\n            excess waters will be drained into reservoirs, a practice to\n            be used in diverting river flows as well; traffic safety\n            measures, and road signaling will be in place to control\n            access roads."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Proyecto de Reforma del Sector\n            Agua Potable y Saneamiento Basico : evaluacion ambiental"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Proyecto d Asistencia\n            para la Reforma del Sector del Agua y Saneamiento B\u00e1sico:\n            Evaluaci\u00f3n ambiental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/11/1490080/colombia-proyecto-de-reforma-del-sector-agua-potable-y-saneamiento-basico-evaluacion-ambiental","projn":"CO-Water Sector Reform Assistance Project -- P065937","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Colombia","authors":{"authr":"Sanchez Triana, Ernesto"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01070604271570"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Water supply,Sanitation,Central government administration","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Water supply\n            systems; Water sanitation; Environmental policy;\n            Institutional framework; Institution building; Soil erosion;\n            Land degradation; Water pollution; Land levelling;\n            Vegetative propagation; Agricultural land; Terracing;\n            Drainage systems; Watershed management; Sanitary landfills;\n            Solid waste disposal; Groundwater protection; Ditches;\n            Aquifer recharge; Reservoirs; Traffic safety; Road signs\n            & signals"}},"owner":"Water & Sanitation Cluster (LCSFW)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"E475"},"facets":{}}}
