Some\n            lessons learned includes: the Bank's experience of\n            implementing projects in post-conflict countries has\n            highlighted the importance of simple and flexible project\n            design. The project was designed around a single contract,\n            with utilization of local consultants where possible and\n            reliance on remote communications and coordination as far as\n            is practical. The project was carefully designed so that\n            policy issues being discussed with the Government at the\n            commencement of engagement will be explored fully. As a\n            result of the project's design, which called for a\n            strategy that not only maximized energy sector revenues, but\n            that was also assessed according to the levels of economic\n            diversification, jobs growth, energy security, and\n            environmental sustainability that it brought, Iraq\n            government policy now considers all of these elements in\n            addressing energy sector development. As a criterion for\n            Bank support, strong interest and political commitment\n            increase client's ownership and quality of delivery.\n            Pursue a strategic process rather than a strategic document\n            to establish the basis for strong implementation. The\n            project consultant was based in Beirut and Dubai/U.A.E, and\n            had strong Arabic speaking expertise. The consultant's\n            geographical vicinity to Iraq is an advantage for a better\n            understanding of local context and domestic issues in order\n            to provide realistic solutions. Design, implementation and\n            supervision in a conflict environment are costly. The\n            importance of strong coordination across multiple ministries\n            and subsectors is critical to achieve targets and ensure\n            sustainability of implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iraq - Integrated National Energy Strategy\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iraq - Integrated National Energy\n

development objective of the\n            Integrated National Energy Strategy Technical Assistance\n            Project for Iraq is to improve the ability of the Government\n            to develop an energy strategy that is designed to increase\n            the contribution of the sector to sustainable development.\n            In response to a letter dated April 10, 2012, from the Prime\n            Minister's Advisory Commission (PMAC), this\n            restructuring aims to extend the project closing date for\n            the project from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013. PMAC has\n            also requested a re-allocation of funds between project\n            categories. The Government has requested an extension of the\n            project closing date in order to a) complete the Final\n            Integrated National Energy Strategy (INES) report to the\n            highest possible standard by July 2012, b) and to allow time\n            for comprehensive consultation on the INES, and early\n            implementation of the INES. The Government has also\n            requested reallocation of remaining uncommitted funds to\n            consulting services to support dissemination of the INES\n            report and early implementation of its recommendations. The\n            project is rated satisfactory against financial management\n            and procurement management. There are no overdue audits\n            reports, safeguards problems, or other pending issues\n            related to this project. The changes do not result in a\n            change of the project activities nor require a modification\n            to the project description in the loan agreement. As of\n            today, US$ 4.93 million (71 percent of the US$ 6.9million\n            approved financing) has been disbursed and a total of US$\n            6.4 million has already been committed. The team intends to\n            formally revise the disbursement schedule at the time the\n            project closing date is extended. The PDOs remain unchanged\n            as do the results framework, and PDO and intermediate\n            results indicators.

PMAC has\n            also requested a re-allocation of funds between project\n            categories. The Government has requested an extension of the\n            project closing date in order to a) complete the Final\n            Integrated National Energy Strategy (INES) report to the\n            highest possible standard by July 2012, b) and to allow time\n            for comprehensive consultation on the INES, and early\n            implementation of the INES. The Government has also\n            requested reallocation of remaining uncommitted funds to\n            consulting services to support dissemination of the INES\n            report and early implementation of its recommendations. The\n            project is rated satisfactory against financial management\n            and procurement management. There are no overdue audits\n            reports, safeguards problems, or other pending issues\n            related to this project. The changes do not result in a\n            change of the project activities nor require a modification\n            to the project description in the loan agreement. As of\n            today, US$ 4.93 million (71 percent of the US$ 6.9million\n            approved financing) has been disbursed and a total of US$\n            6.4 million has already been committed. The team intends to\n            formally revise the disbursement schedule at the time the\n            project closing date is extended. The PDOs remain unchanged\n            as do the results framework, and PDO and intermediate\n            results indicators.
