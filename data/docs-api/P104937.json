Some lessons\n            learned included: contributing factors included a long\n            history of Bank-client dialogue on sector policies and\n            strong analytical foundation, which allowed the Bank to\n            accompany the government in a well-designed and phased\n            program of homegrown sector reform in a complex sector. The\n            programmatic series was centered on a simple policy matrix\n            to substantiate the program of reforms as an emerging\n            political priority, with shared ownership of the reforms by\n            the Ministries of Interior, Finance and Environment.\n            Investment lending could not have provided the same leverage\n            on reforms, due to the DPL nature as entry point to policy\n            dialogue and the visibility accorded to the reform program\n            from the engagement of the Bank. The government was fully\n            committed to the program and took advantage of the analysis,\n            planning framework, implementation support and convening\n            power offered by a DPL program whilst maintaining full\n            leadership and ownership of the reforms themselves, which\n            was also essential factors contributing to the success of\n            the DPL program. While private sector participation as\n            services providers in the MSW sector increased\n            substantially, the capacity building and standard\n            specifications supported by the DPL series have shown their\n            limit in terms of improving cost effectiveness, and more has\n            to be done in terms of market development. For now, the\n            major cities have the funds necessary to contract out\n            services, based on revenues from the municipal service tax,\n            but as coverage rates and service standards continue to\n            increase, new sources of funds targeted to MSW should be\n            developed, also by looking at investments by the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -

Policy\n            Loan (DPL) program is to support the Government of Morocco\n            (GoM) in implementing its program of reforms aimed at\n            improving the financial, environmental and social\n            performance of the municipal solid waste sector in Morocco.\n            Major issues and challenges faced in the sector include: (i)\n            a weak legal and institutional framework, which constrains\n            effective governance of the sector; (ii) poor cost\n            effectiveness of services; with doubtful long-term financial\n            sustainability of the sector; (iii) the urgent need for\n            integrated and modernized solid waste management systems,\n            which will mitigate negative economic, environmental, and\n            social impacts of the existing systems; and (iv) missed\n            opportunities available under international climate change\n            mechanisms i.e. the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), while\n            supporting the global effort in climate change mitigation.\n            There are three key risks associated with the DPL program:\n            1) Morocco's macro economy has so far weathered the\n            negative impact of the global financial crisis because its\n            financial sector was relatively insulated from the global\n            context. However, it is facing the impact of the global\n            economic downturn and is taking the necessary measures to\n            respond; 2) commitments to the reform and implementation\n            capacity risks: (i) weakening of political consensus and\n            commitment for municipal solid waste reforms which may delay\n            or impact the effective implementation of the program. This\n            risk is mitigated by a strong and continuous cross sector\n            dialogue and consultation through the established National\n            Commission for the Program; and (ii) weak capacity to\n            implement complex sector reforms at the municipal level may\n            affect the program's results on the ground; and 3) lack\n            of social acceptance of reforms by the public including the\n            waste pickers and service users. This is being mitigated\n            respectively through the implementation of a social\n            inclusion program targeting waste pickers and through\n            increasing accountability of the service providers for\n            improved quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
