Some lessons\n            learned includes: capacity building in FCS needs to be an\n            integral part of project design, and in extremely low\n            capacity settings investing in a strong Project Coordination\n            Unit (PCU) is risky but has potentially high pay-offs. In\n            FCS settings much Technical Assistance (TA) and capacity\n            building can be effectively provided through regular Bank\n            supervision and by forging close relations with the PCU.\n            Counterpart funding requirements need to be realistic in the\n            context of a government emerging from a context of fragility\n            and conflict. As in any project, but especially in an FCS\n            setting where the Bank has been absent for a long period, it\n            is critical that project components are well adapted to\n            local conditions. Although emergency projects generally do\n            not always pay full attention to good Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems at the project design stage,\n            they should not be completely ignored. Exit strategies for\n            emergency operations are essential but rarely articulated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - Blue Nile Start-Up Emergency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan
