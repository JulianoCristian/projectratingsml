The lessons learned indicate that development\n            communication has emerged as a critical area of ensuring\n            accountability and transparency. The Project demonstrated\n            that in social funds, District managed public works and\n            community development activities can work side by side.\n            Thorough appraisal processes (extended participatory rural\n            appraisals as well as desk and field appraisals) has\n            contributed to the building of ownership. The provision of\n            quality and timely service packages to communities requires\n            better linkage between the work of the districts and central\n            government officials responsible for ensuring that the\n            resources are available to meet recurrent costs for\n            community interventions. Malawi Social Action Fund (MASAF) I\n            and II experiences with community participation has shown\n            the potency of social capital as a vehicle for meeting\n            economic ends, which would lead to a direct impact on\n            poverty at the individual and household levels. The\n            implementation of CDD program such as MASAF, where\n            acquisition of goods and services for the delivery of\n            sub-projects involves many actors requires that costs for\n            the types of infrastructure components funded are more or\n            less estimated with a greater degree of accuracy. An\n            enormous amount of time by the supervision missions went\n            into mutual learning and team building for capacity building\n            as evidenced by the issues covered under

enhance\n            in-country capacity to identify, prioritize, and implement\n            projects by training stakeholders.
