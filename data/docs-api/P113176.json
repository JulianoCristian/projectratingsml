Some lessons\n            learned included: after a long period of internal conflict,\n            international support is likely to be needed for some time,\n            both in terms of security forces and financial resources.\n            Demobilizing non-government armed forces takes time and\n            requires resources. The population typically suffers from a\n            major deficiency in basic needs. Focused reforms are needed\n            to restore the government's basic financial functions\n            and increase their transparency. The reforms and outcome\n            indicators need to be realistic, consistent with the\n            government's capacity, and supported by Technical\n            Assistance (TA) as needed. A Development Policy Operation\n            (DPO) is an effective instrument for addressing key issues\n            in restoring a functional government and contributes to\n            setting the stage for deeper reforms. TA should be available\n            to help implement the reform program and build up capacity\n            in key areas. A close dialogue with the government should be\n            maintained, through frequent supervision missions and field\n            presence. A series of DPOs allows the government to take on\n            the parts of a program outlined in the Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Country Partnership Strategy\n            (CPS) that are appropriate in time and manageable. This\n            approach may be better than laying out a lengthy, strict,\n            programmatic series of credits which may be incompatible\n            with changing circumstances and could lead to an\n            inappropriate sense of non-achievement. The documentation of\n            each DPO should indicate clearly ultimate objectives and\n            achievements in prior operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Second

program document presents a Second\n            Economic Management and Governance Reform Grant Project\n            (EMGRG II) for the Central African Republic (CAR). This is\n            the third development policy operation (DPO) supporting the\n            Government of the CAR, after its successful reengagement\n            with the donor community in 2006. The grant is a\n            single-tranche operation supporting the 2009 budget. The\n            grant supports the second and third pillars of the PRSP.\n            Promoting good governance and the rule of law will be\n            supported by efforts to improve public sector and economic\n            governance through enhanced accountability of the executive\n            and transparent management of public resources. Public\n            finance efforts aim to align the budget with the PRSP,\n            produce comprehensive fiscal reports, increase the role of\n            external oversight bodies, and strengthen Government's\n            revenue mobilization capacity. Structural reforms directed\n            at rebuilding the economy aim to establish a legal and\n            regulatory framework conducive to the development of a\n            competitive mining and
