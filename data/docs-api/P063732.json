The lessons learned indicate that in Indonesia\n            where the legal system has proven ineffective in enforcing\n            the repayment of debt, the willingness of Government to step\n            in and see to it that corporate restructuring takes place\n            was critical. The success of the Jakarta Initiative Task\n            Force (JITF) process has demonstrated the usefulness of\n            alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in Indonesia. The\n            voluntary nature of the JITF process did not work well until\n            an adequate incentive framework had been created. It is\n            important for the Government to take the lead in formulating\n            policies and designing mechanisms where fundamental changes\n            such as those supported by this Project are planned.\n            Political commitment needs to be demonstrated and cannot be\n            assumed. In a crisis situation, sufficient time and\n            attention need to be given to a rigorous project preparation\n            process: researching, assessing options, discussing and\n            getting full Government buy-in and designing effective\n            project management structures, before going ahead with\n            implementation. A lesson from this Project is that\n            inadequate attention and time saved in Project preparation\n            can be a false economy. Field based supervision was\n            important in this project because of the rapidly evolving\n            crisis situation. When new institutions are being created\n            and are untested, such as the Commercial Court and the JITF,\n            care should be taken to guard against making optimistic\n            assumptions and projections concerning their likely\n            effectiveness and performance. Preparation of a financial\n            management/procurement manual at the outset of a project and\n            training of PIU staff in its use can help ensure smooth\n            operations and minimize problems with procurement, payments\n            and disbursements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Corporate Restructuring\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Corporate\n            Restructuring Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/05/3713561/indonesia-corporate-restructuring-technical-assistance-project","projn":"ID-Corporate Restructrg -- P063732","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Strategic Debt Management,Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Intermediation,National Governance,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040526100606"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Law and justice,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative processes,authority,balance\n            sheet,balance sheets,Bank Indonesia,Bank Performance,Bank\n            Restructuring,banking sector,bankruptcy,Central\n            government,Central government\n            administration,citizens,competition\n            policy,competitiveness,consensus,corporate debt,corporate\n            governance,corporate loans,Corporate Restructuring,corporate\n            sector,Corruption,court system,creditors,Debt,debt\n            mediation,Debt Restructuring,debtors,debts,decrees,early\n            warning system,employment,expenditure,expenditures,financial\n            crises,financial crisis,financial institutions,financial\n            management,financial markets,Financial rate of\n            return,Financial Sector,financial sectors,financial\n            system,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,Government officials,incentive\n            framework,Institutional Development,institutional\n            framework,investment climate,judicial reform,judiciary,lack\n            of clarity,Lawyer,legal disputes,Legal\n            institutions,litigation,Ministry of Finance,operating\n            costs,poor governance,privatization,public\n            administration,public sector,regulatory\n            forbearance,regulatory framework,savings,securities,stock\n            exchanges,Technical Assistance,vulnerability,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative processes,authority,balance\n            sheet,balance sheets,Bank Indonesia,Bank Performance,Bank\n            Restructuring,banking sector,bankruptcy,Central\n            government,Central government\n            administration,citizens,competition\n            policy,competitiveness,consensus,corporate debt,corporate\n            governance,corporate loans,Corporate Restructuring,corporate\n            sector,Corruption,court system,creditors,Debt,debt\n            mediation,Debt Restructuring,debtors,debts,decrees,early\n            warning system,employment,expenditure,expenditures,financial\n            crises,financial crisis,financial institutions,financial\n            management,financial markets,Financial rate of\n            return,Financial Sector,financial sectors,financial\n            system,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,Government officials,incentive\n            framework,Institutional Development,institutional\n            framework,investment climate,judicial reform,judiciary,lack\n            of clarity,Lawyer,legal disputes,Legal\n            institutions,litigation,Ministry of Finance,operating\n            costs,poor governance,privatization,public\n            administration,public sector,regulatory\n            forbearance,regulatory framework,savings,securities,stock\n            exchanges,Technical Assistance,vulnerability,working capital"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.
