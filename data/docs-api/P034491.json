The lessons\n            learned indicate that in order to deal with the problems of\n            nontechnical losses and collection, a strong level of\n            sustained Government commitment and support is critical. It\n            is often much more effective to insist that Borrowers work\n            their own way through to solutions (with appropriate\n            assistance and guidance), rather than imposing them from the\n            outside. This approach has been successful in this project,\n            as also noted by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG)\n            supervision review. A well-coordinated stand by the donors\n            on important issues can have a significant impact on a\n            project's success. Implementing sector reforms is a\n            slow process and it is unrealistic to expect rapid progress.\n            Furthermore, privatization requires careful preparation\n            taking into account the country-specific requirements and\n            establishing in advance the appropriate legislative basis\n            and an effectively functioning regulatory framework.\n            Flexibility has to be adopted in choosing an appropriate\n            form of privatization (sale of assets, concessions,\n            management contracts) depending on internal and external factors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -
