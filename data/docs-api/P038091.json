The report furthers\n            the knowledge base on road safety programs, as well as\n            governance and institutional issues in the transport sector.\n            It agrees with the completion report in all ratings except\n            that the outcome is judged to be moderately satisfactory\n            instead of satisfactory.  Three important lessons may be\n            drawn from the project: A) Improvements in governance can\n            best be achieved when there is a holistic program of\n            institutional reform mandated at the highest levels of\n            government, with interactive communication with operational\n            staff to ensure that the changes take place in the field as\n            envisioned. B) Traffic safety projects can be particularly\n            successful where there is strong government commitment and\n            support and where a participatory approach is pursued to\n            ensure the support of all the diverse stakeholders.  C) The\n            elimination of road accident black spots can be a highly\n            cost effective way to reduce both the accident rate and the\n            degree of severity of the accidents occurring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Road Improvement and Traffic Safety Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Road Improvement and\n            Traffic Safety Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5633264/turkey-road-improvement-traffic-safety-project","projn":"TR-Road Improvement & Traffic Safety\n            Project -- P038091","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Urban Transport,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Road Safety","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20050302091339"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways,Health","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accident rates, Annual Report, Banks,\n            bidding, bottlenecks, bridges, cars, Civil Engineering,\n            construction, drivers, economic development, fatalities,\n            Feasibility Studies, freight transport, heavy vehicles,\n            Highways, hospitals, implementation, information systems,\n            injuries, injury, natural resources, net benefits,\n            partnership, paved highways, Pavement, Pavement Management,\n            Pavement Management System, Police, ports, printers,\n            procurement, project, project implementation, project\n            preparation, Project Report, provincial roads, Public\n            Sector, railways, Rehabilitation, resource allocation, road\n            accidents, Road deterioration, ROAD IMPROVEMENT, road\n            improvements, road investment, road planning, Road Safety,\n            road safety education, road system, road traffic, road\n            transport, Roads, rural roads, safety campaigns, schools,\n            service roads, social integration, span, speed, towns,\n            TRAFFIC, Traffic Accidents, traffic management, Traffic\n            Police, traffic regulations, TRAFFIC SAFETY, traffic\n            volumes, transparency, transport, trucks, victims"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF031968-TURKEY - ROAD\n            IMPROVEMENT;SAFETY PROJECT,TF039666-TURKEY - ROAD IMPROVEMENT,TF039679-CENTRAL ASIA - PROJECTS IN ECA.\n            SUPPORT TO ECA TRANSPORT TEAM","repnb":"31520"},"2814333":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/11/2814333/turkey-road-improvement-traffic-safety-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/11/2814333/turkey-road-improvement-traffic-safety-project","new_url":"2003/11/2814333/turkey-road-improvement-traffic-safety-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/12/09/000090341_20031209114032/Rendered/INDEX/25541.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/12/09/000090341_20031209114032/Rendered/PDF/25541.pdf","loan_no":"4049;4048","datestored":"2003-12-09T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-11-06T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Road Improvement & Traffic\n            Safety Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the Road Improvement and\n            Traffic Safety Project for Turkey were as follows: the\n            outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate that in looking back at the experience\n            gathered through this project, there are two major areas\n            where lessons emerge: (i) the successful implementation of a\n            rather complex traffic safety component involving several\n            agencies; and, (ii) the approach taken by the project to\n            influence governance issues in a sector prone to capture by\n            strong vested interests. In particular: The Traffic Safety\n            Experience - the design of this component was, from the\n            outset, the result of a participatory exercise in which each\n            organization involved in the project brought its own\n            perspective to the traffic safety problem and proposed its\n            own solutions. The individualistic approach to the issues at\n            stake slowly evolved into a collegial system structured\n            under the Task Force that was the key player in the\n            implementation of the component. This accomplishment, not a\n            minor feat in a country not known for inter-agency\n            coordination, can be attributed to the adoption of the\n            \"best fit\" rather than \"best practice\"\n            approach. The Governance Issue - the project was prepared at\n            a time in which the structural issues of governance were not\n            as clearly recognized as today, maybe confusing capabilities\n            (or lack thereof) with rent seeking behavior, and proposing\n            institutional development rather than major policy reforms.\n            The Bank's position of not participating in the\n            financing, and therefore not condoning, the practice of\n            continuous changes of design and cost overruns, was a step\n            in the right direction given the relationship with Turkey at\n            the time. A related question from which it might be possible\n            to draw some useful lessons refers to the Bank's\n            decision to deny a Government request to extend the life of\n            the loan. At that time substantial human and financial costs\n            had been sunk in the preparation of a fairly sophisticated\n            Highway Information System."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Road Improvement & Traffic\n            Safety Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey -
