Some lessons learned included:\n            governmental leadership/ownership is crucial to the\n            achievement of success in large scale national programs and\n            to ensuring that all available resources both internal and\n            external are maximized. The establishment of well structured\n            and unified coordination mechanisms, particularly where many\n            agencies and sectors are involved is crucial to for\n            successful implementation. Involvement of ministries and\n            sectors other than health is crucial in the successful\n            implementation of activities targeted towards diverse\n            populations e.g. harm reduction and Anti Retroviral (ARV)\n            treatment in the penitentiary system. It is important that\n            treatment services begin to be decentralized so as to\n            decrease the potentially negative impact of travel by\n            patients to centralized treatment location may have on\n            treatment adherence. Continuity in Bank team members working\n            on projects is critical particularly during early project\n            implementation when it is critical to get the project\n            started effectively. It is important that plans for\n            sustaining efforts started under projects are outlined from\n            as early as project preparation, particularly when\n            investments are made in areas that are costly. Planning for\n            maintenance of medical equipment and infrastructure is one\n            critical area that is often overlooked."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - AIDS Control

AIDS Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The AIDS Control Project for Moldova\n            finances the AIDS Component of the Moldova TB/AIDS Program,\n            which aims at improving Moldova's health status and\n            assisting the country to achieve it s health-related\n            Millennium Development Goals through reducing mortality,\n            morbidity and transmission of HIVIAIDS, and other sexually\n            transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB). This\n            program is one of the key pieces of the Government's\n            poverty reduction strategy in the health sector, as it will\n            prevent further groups from falling into poverty due to\n            disabling diseases. The project has three main components\n            beside project management. Component 1, strategic planning\n            & institutional capacity building for HIV/AIDS/STIs\n            control, finances activities to enhance Moldova's\n            capacity in HIV/AIDS/STIs policy making and planning; and\n            supports the CCM and HIV/AIDS National Program to review\n            legislations and regulations related to HIV/AIDS/STIs and\n            propose improvements. Selected operational research would be\n            supported to provide the information base for better\n            policies. The project supports the implementation of a\n            second-generation surveillance system that monitors both HIV\n            infection and risk behaviors (especially among injecting\n            drug users (IDUs) and other highly vulnerable groups) to\n            inform the trend of the epidemic; strengthens laboratory\n            capacity; and provides training. Component 2, scaling up\n            prevention interventions for HIV/AIDS/STIs and STI\n            management, provides targeted interventions for vulnerable\n            and highly vulnerable groups (young people, especially IDUs,\n            commercial sex workers), men that have sex with men,\n            prisoners, military and STIs clinic attendees); helps\n            disseminate the protocol for mother-to-child transmission,\n            supports universal voluntary counseling and testing at\n            ante-natal clinics, and provides HIV-positive pregnant women\n            with short courses of anti-retrovirals (ARV) and infant\n            feeding options; and finances other preventive\n            interventions. Component 3, treatment, care and support for\n            persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA),  finances the\n            dissemination of clinical protocols for opportunistic\n            infections (OI) management (including TB) and care, trains\n            health workers in implementing such protocols; and ensures\n            the availability of a package of basic drugs for OI\n            management in clinics that deal with AIDS patients; provides\n            highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART); and provides\n            in partnership with nongovernmental organizations, home and\n            community-based care and support for PLWHA."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - AIDS Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - AIDS Control
