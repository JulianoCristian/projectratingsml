Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Emergency Road Rehabilitation\n            Project for Iraq had a moderately satisfactory outcome with\n            substantial risk to development outcome. Performance by the\n            Bank and the borrower was moderately satisfactory as well.\n            The project was restructured twice. The first restructuring\n            was to (a) extend the closing date to allow for the\n            implementation of the Um Qasr Al Zubair highway\n            rehabilitation, and (b) to reallocate funds between\n            expenditure categories for Part B to cover escalating\n            construction costs in the Works category. The second\n            restructuring was to (a) extend the closing date to complete\n            on-going works and technical assistance (TA) components for\n            Part A, (b) revise the key performance indicators to reflect\n            realistic results for road and bridge rehabilitation, and\n            (c) to modify the project scope to include a requested\n            supplementary activity to prepare a Transport Sector Master\n            Plan. It is important to note that in 2010 a change in\n            mandate of the implementing agency for Part A, the State\n            Commission for Roads and Bridges (SCRB), meant that the\n            responsibility for village access roads now fell under each\n            Governorate, which financed the rehabilitation of village\n            access roads from their own funds going forward. As a\n            result, all remaining village access road sub-projects for\n            Part A were cancelled as was the development of a road asset\n            management (RAM) system for rural roads to be implemented at\n            SCRB. The following lessons were learned from this project:\n            (1) Timely ratification is important to avoid implementation\n            delay. (2) Generous price contingencies are necessary to\n            control cost overrun in an environment where sourcing and\n            mobilizing material is challenging. (3) More attention\n            should be paid to attract much-needed international\n            expertise by reducing the security risk and increasing the\n            interest level of bidders. (4) In a challenging operating\n            environment, it is important to be able to rely on local\n            agents to monitor safeguards issues in the absence of\n            Bank-led supervision missions. (5) High level commitment is\n            crucial for effective project implementation, particularly\n            in fragile operational environments marked by conflict. (6)\n            Remaining flexible, engaging in continuous dialogue, and\n            showing readiness to adjust to new circumstances should be a\n            top priority when implementing projects in Iraq."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iraq - Emergency Road Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iraq - Emergency Road\n            Rehabilitation Project  : Iraq - Emergency Road\n

Considering the emergency situation and the\n            current security conditions in Iraq, the Environmental and\n            Social Screening Assessment Framework (ESSAF) designed for\n            Iraq will be used for this project. This project entails\n            road rehabilitation, improvement of village access roads,\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of the Erbil to Altun Kopri\n            Road, replacement of existing pontoon bridges, and,\n            technical support. Work projects will therefore be subject\n            to an environmental screening, based on an environmental\n            analysis which includes an evaluation of alternatives,\n            including the \"no-action alternative\" and an\n            examination of the direct and indirect effects of proposed\n            actions, and, an environmental and social management plan\n            will provide a framework for mitigation, monitoring and\n            institutional strengthening actions to be integrated into\n            the design and implementation of the project. Public\n            consultation will be undertaken and environmental studies\n            disclosed to the public.

Mitigation measures\n            include appropriate engineering design, and, the project\n            will assess feasible alternative/temporary options on a\n            case-by-case basis, to comply with the local ecology.\n            Wastewater must not enter streams without settling ponds,\n            filters, or other processes. Co-ordination with\n            stakeholders, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) must\n            begin in the design phase itself. The natural landscape\n            shall be preserved to the extent possible, through\n            operations that prevent unnecessary destruction, or scarring\n            of natural surroundings. The report also addresses potential\n            resettlement, and compensation issues, including in\n            particular, ethnic groups to ensure these groups\n            participate, and benefit

Recovery\n            Operation. Considering the emergency situation and the\n            current security conditions in Iraq, the Environmental and\n            Social Screening Assessment Framework (ESSAF) designed for\n            Iraq will be used for this project. This project entails\n            road rehabilitation, improvement of village access roads,\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of the Erbil to Altun Kopri\n            Road, replacement of existing pontoon bridges, and,\n            technical support. Work projects will therefore be subject\n            to an environmental screening, based on an environmental\n            analysis which includes an evaluation of alternatives,\n            including the \"no-action alternative\" and an\n            examination of the direct and indirect effects of proposed\n            actions, and, an environmental and social management plan\n            will provide a framework for mitigation, monitoring and\n            institutional strengthening actions to be integrated into\n            the design and implementation of the project.

Mitigation measures\n            include appropriate engineering design, and, the project\n            will assess feasible alternative/temporary options on a\n            case-by-case basis, to comply with the local ecology.\n            Wastewater must not enter streams without settling ponds,\n            filters, or other processes.

The natural landscape\n            shall be preserved to the extent possible, through\n            operations that prevent unnecessary destruction, or scarring\n            of natural surroundings.
