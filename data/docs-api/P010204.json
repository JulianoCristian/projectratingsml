The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and the performance of both the Bank\n            and Borrower was less than satisfactory. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, an efficient and\n            effective Apex Institution is crucial to the success of this\n            type of project, particularly during the period of\n            institutional development and sector strengthening. Second,\n            IDA needs to define clear performance standards and\n            sanctions in case of non-performance for participating\n            financial intermediaries. Third, IDA should not transfer\n            responsibilities to its Resident Missions before preparation\n            and clear definition of tasks are complete. Fourth, IDA\n            should take into account that financial markets and policies\n            may change, particularly when it is pressing for financial\n            reforms. Fifth, IDA should devote more attention and staff\n            resources to the supervision of technical assistance. Sixth,\n            technical support to less developed regions can only be\n            effective when adequate infrastructure and technically\n            qualified personnel are in place. Lastly, IDA should take a\n            more proactive role in administrating its co-financing funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Small Industries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Small\n            Industries Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/06/734204/pakistan-second-small-industries-project","projn":"PK-Small Scale Ind.
