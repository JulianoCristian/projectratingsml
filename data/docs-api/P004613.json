Lessons\n            learned from the project: Water resources management remains\n            a priority of the national government and will continue to\n            be an important element in the country's development\n            strategy. The success of any irrigation management transfer\n            (IMT) initiative must include skills and technical\n            capacity-building for farmers especially in aspects of\n            irrigation modernization, monitoring and evaluation,\n            operations and maintenance, and funds management. Uniform\n            IMT policies applied to all systems, regardless of funding\n            sources, lead to effective overall management of irrigation\n            systems. Watershed management can be effective if activities\n            and investments are linked to local priorities, make use of\n            local knowledge and experiences, and are oriented towards an\n            ecosystem approach. Accurate information and a complete data\n            base significantly contribute to sound decision-making,\n            networking, and planning. A key factor that contributes to\n            the success of any IWRM effort is the strong partnership\n            among the different agencies and sectors involved in water\n            resource management. Undertaking a long-term programmatic\n            approach at the national and local levels will ensure and\n            sustain the positive impacts of IMT. Effective watershed\n            management requires a highly participative and\n            \"bottom-up\" approach that begins with\n            multi-sectoral consultations, planning, priority setting,\n            implementation and monitoring and evaluation with technical\n            guidance from the Department of Environment and Natural\n            Resources (DENR)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Water Resources Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Water Resources\n            Development

appropriate policy and institutional framework to improve\n            water resources planning, development and management;\n            initiating an integrated and comprehensive approach to water\n            shed management to sustain water sources; improving existing\n            irrigation system efficiency, thereby increasing\n            agricultural production, and alleviating rural poverty;\n            improving irrigation services in the long term by\n            accelerating management turnover of irrigation systems to\n            water users and by increasing the National Irrigation\n            Administration's (NIA's) institutional\n            effectiveness; and improving the environment in irrigated\n            areas.  The five year project will include the following\n            components: a) improved water resources planning and\n            management - preparation of a national water resources plan,\n            improvement of national data collection networks,\n            establishment of a national water information network and\n            strengthening of the National Water Resources Board (NWRB);\n            b) improved watershed management - formulation of a national\n            watershed management strategy and investment and\n            institutional strengthening program, investments for\n            improved management; and staff training/study watershed\n            management tour; c) improvement and repair of National\n            Irrigation System (NIS) - system improvement, repairs in\n            major structures, strengthening of Masiway dam, and\n            construction of sediment inclusion structures; d)\n            institutional strengthening of NIA and Irrigators\n            Associations (IAs) - staff training, consultancies,\n            computers and incremental operating costs to facilitate\n            progressive management; and e) environmental improvement -\n            control of schistosomiasis, erosion control works; sediment\n            monitoring, and establishment of an Environmental Unit\n            within NIA and provision of training and
