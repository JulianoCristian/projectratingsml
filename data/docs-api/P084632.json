Some lessons learned included: for technically\n            innovative and institutionally complex projects such as the\n            establishment of hydrological information system (HIS)\n            across India, a long-term programmatic and demand driven\n            approach is required, allowing each implementing agency (IA)\n            to progress at its own pace and evolving needs. Central\n            agencies need to take a spearheading role regarding HIS data\n            exchange and dissemination, in order to accelerate the\n            present paradigm shift towards river basin planning and\n            integrated water resources management (IWRM) in India.\n            Integration of state surface water (SW) and ground water\n            (GW) departments and (particularly) state data centers\n            facilitates and promotes the integration of SW and GW data\n            analyses, enables the adoption of an IWRM approach at state\n            level, and improves joint project management and\n            implementation.
