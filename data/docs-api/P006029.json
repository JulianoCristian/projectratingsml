Some\n            lessons learned included: technical assistance loans can be\n            effective complements of structural adjustment loans in\n            lending for reform. Bank interventions can be most effective\n            when they capitalize on windows of opportunities that\n            provide unique momentum to the implementation of reforms. A\n            strong conviction on the part of the highest political\n            authorities is required to sustain momentum during the\n            implementation of reforms. However, the ultimate test is\n            their final acceptance by in-house government personnel and\n            the incorporation of technological solutions in day-to-day\n            operations. A Government agency has to provide a\n            well-defined vision of its future and clear specification of\n            how to realize this vision.
