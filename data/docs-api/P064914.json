Some lessons learned include: there are\n            inevitable complexities in pursuing objectives of poverty\n            reduction and rural development through sustainable use of\n            natural resources in a decentralized environment, through\n            bottom-up processes. Effectively introducing and managing\n            participatory processes requires a great deal of effort and\n            attention on the part of the project. The cost of this\n            effort, in terms of project staff time is likely to be\n            significant and ought to be accompanied by above-average\n            budget resources. Strengthening existing local institutions\n            (e.g., community-based organization, municipal governments\n            and their associated civil society institutions) and\n            promoting a culture of civil society participation pays high\n            dividends in terms of transparency, ownership,\n            accountability and quality of project investment. This\n            requires appropriate investments in strengthening local\n            institutions and their social capital in order to improve\n            the governance of the local decision making processes and\n            ensure that they are both democratic and representative of\n            local aspirations. Institution building has generally been\n            identified as one area where World Bank projects have had\n            only limited success. The potential for success in this area\n            and for achieving institutional sustainability of project\n            outcomes can be enhanced when project design and\n            implementation both focus on having and implementing an\n            institutional exit strategy throughout the entire project\n            cycle. For complex interventions, scaling up should be\n            attempted only if the pilot itself is of reasonable size and\n            replicates. In establishing a system for decentralized and\n            privatized extension, there should be a combination of\n            private and producer organization-based technical service\n            providers. The former are needed where innovation\n            specialized services are required. The latter have the\n            benefit of being decentralized already, and working with and\n            through them builds local level capacity and creates the\n            potential for more efficient expansion of the system\n            locally, and across other crops and activities. Where there\n            are complex institutional scenarios for project\n            implementation, there is a good argument for locating\n            project implementation responsibility at the policy-level\n            rather than at the operational-level. Community forestry is\n            a viable instrument to achieve sustainable Natural Resources\n            Management (NRM) and economic development of indigenous and\n            non-indigenous communities under common land property regimes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Forests and Rural Productivity Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Forests and Rural\n
