Several lessons convey\n            the following. The strong motivation, as experienced by this\n            operation, shows that a small size credit (with subprojects)\n            can have a good impact on the recipient government's\n            policy reforms, and institutional strengthening, provided\n            timing is fully aligned with a political window of\n            opportunity for reform. The project involved a flexible\n            process approach, which although appropriate given the\n            uncertainties of the demand for technical assistance (TA)\n            and of a changing environment, it could however, cause\n            implementation delays and difficulties in supervision.\n            Partly, the four extensions to the closing dates, was\n            related to this. To ensure the project is implemented in a\n            timely manner, yet respond to the needs of the policy\n            makers, alternative ways should be considered. The Bank and\n            Government should adopt a more strategic approach to\n            analyze, and prioritize government needs, and identify the\n            most binding constraints to economic development, and\n            continued reform. Second, subproject planning and approval\n            approach, should be improved, by more efficiently meeting -\n            the Bank and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) teams - on a\n            quarterly basis, to discuss priorities, the assisted areas,\n            and agree on the lending program. To keep the momentum\n            within a TA project, and allow participation of the\n            potentially priority agencies and localities, it is ideal if\n            MOF and local finance bureaus, consider taking the repayment\n            responsibility of the credit/loan, and require repayment\n            only from those revenue-earning agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Reform, Institutional Support and\n            Preinvestment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Reform, Institutional\n            Support and Preinvestment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4906236/china-reform-institutional-support-preinvestment-project","projn":"CN-Ref.
