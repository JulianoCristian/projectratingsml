Project preparation should be undertaken prior to\n            appraisal. There are no synergies between electric utility\n            rehabilitation/reform projects and woodfuel efficiency\n            projects. In projects with multiple cofinanciers, the\n            financing plan for the bulk of the required resources should\n            be firmly in place prior to Board presentation. Borrower\n            ownership of sector reforms is essential and should be\n            clearly demonstrated by the time of Credit negotiations.\n            Complex sector reform projects are supervision intensive and\n            require the Bank to staff teams with the necessary range of\n            skills to cover the gamut of institutional, financial, legal\n            and technical issues. Mid-term reviews should be used to\n            address alldesign and implementation problems and there\n            should be greater openness on the part of staff to undertake\n            major project restructuring if circumstances so dictate.\n            Frequent changes of task managers is deleterious to\n            successful project implementation. The Bank should be more\n            willing to exercise available legal remedies when faced with\n            serious non-compliance on financial covenants, particularly\n            as regards tariff adjustments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
