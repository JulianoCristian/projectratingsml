Ratings for the Bukhara and\n            Samarkand Water Supply Project were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: when designing\n            infrastructure and service provision projects within the\n            context of a regional environmental crisis it is essential\n            to minimize objectives and keep them focused on\n            interventions the borrower will support. In this case,\n            driven by the Aral Sea crisis, the Water Supply, Sanitation\n            and Health Project overly emphasized the need to mitigate a\n            range of ill-defined public health problems when even\n            provision of basic services like potable water supply was in\n            jeopardy. Adoption of community driven development models in\n            a country where the culture of community self-help lacks\n            prominence may require additional capacity-building efforts.\n            The practicality and realism of bringing about institutional\n            strengthening of a developing country\u2019s main utilities\n            through a performance-based management contract needs very\n            careful appraisal. Proper tariff setting and demand\n            management efforts are critical factors that lead to\n            expansion in customer base and increased revenues for the\n            utilities. The Buhkara and Samarkand Water Supply Project\n            managed to increase water metering significantly through\n            various measures, leading to enhanced collection of\n            revenues. However, due to lack of financial autonomy, the\n            utility is experiencing difficulty collecting the arrears\n            from government institutions. This is likely to adversely\n            affect the utilities\u2019 commercial performance if the\n            government does not address the utilities\u2019 autonomy issue soon."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uzbekistan - Water Supply, Sanitation and\n            Health Project; and Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uzbekistan - Water

Some lessons learned included:\n            application of the Bank's procurement rules in this\n            project achieved cost savings that at times were unexpected\n            and allowed the project to be more cost efficient than\n            originally anticipated. A precise understanding of the\n            actual investment costs may not be easy to achieve,\n            especially in a high-inflation environment. Nonetheless,\n            better cost monitoring systems can help. Overestimation of\n            project budgets by as large an amount as in this project\n            results in unnecessarily high commitment fees that the\n            Borrower must pay. This project was one of the first Bank\n            operations in Uzbekistan and the Bank's procurement\n            practices were new and unfamiliar to the Borrower. This\n            resulted in very significant delays in implementation. Task\n            teams should give careful consideration to procurement\n            capacity-building needs and address them in project design\n            with adequate resources allocated for procurement training\n            and monitoring for implementing agencies. Although policy\n            reform was explicitly omitted as a project objective, major\n            changes in tariff policy and water demand management led to\n            markedly improved

      and sanitation facilities for the Republic of Karakalpakstan\n            and Khorezm Oblast in Uzbekistan,  reducing water-borne\n            diseases, particularly diarrheal diseases among children;\n            and to strengthen institutional capacity of the regional\n            water supply and sanitation utilities, and the regional\n            health centers and sanitary epidemiology stations. The\n            project has four main components: 1) The water supply and\n            distribution component has four subcomponents, consisting of\n            a) replacing and rehabilitating sections of the distribution\n            systems, water treatment plants, and ground water sources,\n            and building more trunk pipelines; b) developing the local\n            water supply and distribution systems, including providing\n            spare parts for desalinization units; c) water demand\n            management and loss reduction, including metered water\n            usage, consumer awareness, and leakage reduction; and d)\n            equipment for operation and maintenance; 2) the sanitation,\n            health, and hygiene component will a) build improved\n            latrines and handwashing facilities, and provide equipment,\n            transportation, and consultants and training; b) promote\n            health and hygiene education in selected rural and urban\n            communities; and c) improve water quality monitoring and\n            sanitation and hygiene inspection of households and communal\n            facilities, and improve the institutional capacity of\n            related agencies; 3) the technical assistance component will\n            institutionally strengthen water utilities and bulk\n            providers, finance a water and sewerage tariff study, and\n            refinance a feasibility study; and 4) the last component\n            will fund project management, project design, and\n            construction
