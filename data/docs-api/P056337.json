The first\n            develops effective procedures for a technically and\n            environmentally sound approach to formally closing\n            uneconomic mines including building dams on both sides of\n            mine barriers to prevent bursting due to accumulation of\n            acid underground water build-up, acid water treatment,\n            measures to prevent contamination of subterranean\n            acquifiers, permanently sealing underground workings all\n            mine openings, preventing gas leakage, demolition of surface\n            buildings and structures, and environmental remediation that\n            restores surface lands, protects waste dumps against mud\n            slides or failed dump slopes, rehabilitates waste dumps,\n            restores water courses, collects and treats polluted\n            effluents, protects oil pipelines, and treats surface soil.\n            The second component identifies the measures most effective\n            in mitigating social hardships resulting from the\n            sector's restructuring, and assists in creating\n            diversified employment opportunities for redundant labor.\n            The third component strengthens the agencies involved in\n            restructuring the sector and introducing a modern mining\n            licensing system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -Mine Closure and
