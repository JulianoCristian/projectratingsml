Some lessons drawn from\n            the project convey the following. Post conflict environments\n            present a high risk regarding finance plans, and funding\n            capacity; thus, agreements should be formalized a priori,\n            since for example, in the case of the Department for\n            International Cooperation's (DFID) involvement\n            concerning the health financing system studies, the absence\n            of an agreement, resulted in the breakdown of this work, a\n            fact aggravated by the Government's weak capacity to\n            make financial commitments. In addition, the local capacity\n            should be assessed prior to project preparation, and the\n            Bank should ensure the necessary capacity building to assist\n            implementing agencies, through training and\n            consultant's assistance at the very early stages.\n            Although introduction of reforms in post-conflict situations\n            is seemingly, unlikely to succeed promptly, the reform\n            process initiated under this project demonstrates the\n            practicality of such move, rather than waiting for the\n            appropriate political situation -
