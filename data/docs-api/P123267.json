Some lessons learned\n            included: the operation can be seen as a good example how\n            DPLs can serve as a trigger to engage in more fundamental\n            policy dialogue with client countries with medium income\n            levels and where macroeconomic capacity is already high.\n            From the perspective of middle-income client countries, the\n            Bank's value added in such operations may especially\n            come from transaction costs reductions. Given the\n            considerations, it is difficult to assess the benefits of\n            development policy operations (DPOs) in high-capacity\n            middle-income countries exclusively against the indicators\n            outlined in the results framework. More technical lesson\n            learned is to remain conservative with revising upwards\n            targets that critically depend on the external economic\n            environment in view of short-term cyclical fluctuations. The\n            operation shows that embarking on a sustainable fiscal path\n            does not necessarily entail cuts in social spending that\n            will have adverse impacts on poverty and shared prosperity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - First Programmatic Fiscal\n            Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan

Colombia is to\n            enhanced fiscal sustainability and strengthened resilience\n            of economic growth. The Government of Colombia has requested\n            a DPL for US$300 million. The DPL is the first of a series\n            of two operations supporting the fiscal management program\n            of the Government of Colombia in the context of increased\n            commodities production (oil and mining), mounting long term\n            social sector liabilities, and rising fiscal risks\n            associated with natural hazards. The request underscores the\n            Government's continued interest in engaging with the\n            World Bank to support its efforts in improving fiscal\n            management. The reform program supported by the loan series\n            seeks to enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthen growth\n            resilience. The program includes a series of measures that\n            can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a)\n            improved budget predictability and stability, (b) improved\n            social security liability management, and (c) improved\n            disaster risk financing management. The introduction of a\n            fiscal rule with a stabilization fund seeks to reduce and\n            limit the structural fiscal deficit. A tax reform aims to\n            increase revenue collection and improve the efficiency of\n            the tax system. Both measures will improve budget\n            predictability and stability, which are the cornerstone for\n            sound macroeconomic management of an economy which is\n            increasingly relying on commodities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - First Programmatic Fiscal\n            Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan

Colombia is to\n            enhanced fiscal sustainability and strengthened resilience\n            of economic growth. The Government of Colombia has requested\n            a DPL for US$300 million. The DPL is the first of a series\n            of two operations supporting the fiscal management program\n            of the Government of Colombia in the context of increased\n            commodities production (oil and mining), mounting long term\n            social sector liabilities, and rising fiscal risks\n            associated with natural hazards. The request underscores the\n            Government's continued interest in engaging with the\n            World Bank to support its efforts in improving fiscal\n            management. The reform program supported by the loan series\n            seeks to enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthen growth\n            resilience. The program includes a series of measures that\n            can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a)\n            improved budget predictability and stability, (b) improved\n            social security liability management, and (c) improved\n            disaster risk financing management. The introduction of a\n            fiscal rule with a stabilization fund seeks to reduce and\n            limit the structural fiscal deficit. A tax reform aims to\n            increase revenue collection and improve the efficiency of\n            the tax system. Both measures will improve budget\n            predictability and stability, which are the cornerstone for\n            sound macroeconomic management of an economy which is\n            increasingly relying on commodities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Primer Prestamo Programatico Para\n            Politicas de Desarrollo en Favor de la Recuperacion del\n            Crecimiento y la
