Two main lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, the OGDC (Oil and Gas\n            Development Company) needs to establish a financial\n            management system satisfactory to the Bank in order to\n            handle accounts properly. Second, the Bank's assumption\n            about the outcome of the project was overly optimistic. The\n            failure rate of the project was much higher than expected.\n            In the future, the Bank needs to take into account all of\n            the risks and possible outcomes of a project. This will\n            allow the Bank to be prepared for and able to handle\n            unexpected outcomes when they arise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Toot Oil and Gas\n
