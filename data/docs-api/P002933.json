The lessons learned\n            include: a) The mechanism of achieving the objective may be\n            as important as identifying the objective. b) The project is\n            a local government development project. As such, its\n            management should have been the elected leadership who set\n            up goals and objectives not the appointed civil servants. c)\n            Phasing of consultant services appeared to be determined\n            from the consulting firm's point of view rather than\n            from the standpoint of the requirement of the transfer of\n            technology. d) The strategic framework for reform was\n            developed in-house by Kampala City Council's (KCC) own\n            staff and adopted with the participation of all\n            stakeholders. KCC should have been given responsibility for\n            the management of the Project. e) When people are well\n            informed and recognize the desire of the general public for\n            improved service delivery that cannot be met under the\n            prevailing institutional structure and arrangement, with\n            appropriate incentive, they can spearhead reforms including\n            right-sizing of the organization. f) It is important that\n            the project implementation team has qualified procurement\n            staff. If need be, a short-term procurement specialist\n            consultancy should assist the implementation team at the\n            start and various intervals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - First Urban Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda -
