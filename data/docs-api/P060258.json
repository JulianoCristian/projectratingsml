The\n            dilemma of supporting a country in crisis is highlighted by\n            Policy Reform Support Loan - PRSL I and, more especially, by\n            PRSL II. The Bank needs to provide the Board with a frank\n            rationale for its intervention. The experience in Indonesia\n            highlights the importance of avoiding delays in banking\n            crisis: unless resolved quickly and decisively, the fiscal\n            costs mount and vested interests further impede resolution.\n            In a major crisis, Bank management and top technical\n            specialists should give priority to resolving issues that\n            arise in the context of Bank assistance addressing the\n            crisis, even if the vehicle for the assistance is in the\n            form of a relatively modest technical assistance loan.\n            Coordination among donor agencies is essential in countries\n            in crisis and needs to be made explicit. In Indonesia,\n            coordination was successful only after an initial period of\n            uncertainty, mainly because the IMF was able to take the\n            lead. The Bank's' consultant fee structure and\n            procurement rules caused delays and impeded a rapid response\n            to Indonesia's banking crisis, and excluded or\n            discouraged the few service providers with appropriate\n            technical expertise. The Bank's central unit Special\n            Financial Operations (SFO) enabled the Bank to respond to\n            Indonesia's need for technical expertise, but the unit\n            was not well integrated into the Bank's organization\n            and was unfamiliar with its operational procedures, causing\n            bureaucratic and practical problems. The Bank's\n            performance for PRSL I is rated as satisfactory, while under\n            Banking Reform Assistance Project (BRAP,) and PRSL 11 is\n            rated unsatisfactory, in part because quality at entry for\n            these two loans was not good. The Bank lacked a strategy for\n            dealing with the crisis and timely support from senior Bank\n            management was inadequate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First and Second Policy

and accurate data and analyses are necessary for good policy\n            design and also for the implementation of the agreed policy.\n            6) Close working relations between the Bank's\n

  social safety net to protect Indonesia's poor and\n            preserve human assets during the difficult times; 2)\n            supporting efforts to stabilize the economy by helping\n            restore banks and businesses to financial health, maintain\n            physical assets, and resume growth; and 3) strengthening\n            institutions to support sustainable growth. It will deepen\n            and build policy reforms that have been undertaken since the\n            initial Policy Reform Support Loan in July, 1998. The\n            project will contribute to economic stabilization,\n            subsequent recovery, and renewed poverty-reducing growth.\n            The financial resources provided under this loan will help\n            Indonesia avoid an even larger transitional decline in\n            consumption and investment. The stimulus provided by a\n            temporarily large budget deficit, financed in part by this\n            loan, will help sustain aggregate demand. Most of the risks\n            identified can be mitigated by the Bank. Nevertheless,\n            political uncertainties remain paramount in determining the\n            magnitude of the risks. With the open election scheduled for\n            June. 1999, it is unclear which political coalition will\n            emerge to form the new leadership. The credibility of the\n            next government will depend on the public's perception\n            of fairness in the election process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Policy Reform
