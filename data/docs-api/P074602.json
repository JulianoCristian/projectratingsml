Lessons learned from the project: In a\n            delicate political transition process, following years of\n            conflict, it is unrealistic to expect a government to carry\n            out a broad and complex economic reform program. The\n            operation should have been sharply focused on improving\n            public finance management. The private sector development\n            component was not sufficiently prepared. Before launching a\n            privatization program, it is important to liquidate a number\n            of public enterprises, which are technically bankrupt,\n            potentially costly to be restructured, and therefore, are\n            not expected to generate any positive value added under\n            private management. Clearance of government arrears to the\n            private sector is important to help private operators resume\n            their activities in a post-conflict context. The reform of\n            the coffee industry is essential for improving\n            Burundi's exports and the incomes of a large number of\n            small farmers. Improving public finance management was\n            essential for enabling the transition government and its\n            successor to finance critical programs aimed at national\n            reconciliation, enhanced security, and rehabilitation of\n            economic and social infrastructure. The rehabilitation\n            program was implemented on behalf of line ministries by a\n            special unit under streamlined procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Economic Rehabilitation

in the process, and implementation of the\n            Government's reform program. It will help build the\n            foundation for a) the improvement of public service\n            delivery, and basic social services, through promotion of\n            accountability, and transparency in the use of public funds,\n            including external assistance; b) the Government's\n            efforts to deepen institutional, and structural reforms for\n            sustained economic recovery, and poverty reduction; and, c)\n            the establishment of a track record for early access to\n            relief, under the Enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Country\n            (HIPC) Initiative. By focusing on public expenditure\n            management, rural development, private sector development,\n            and pro-poor sectoral policies, it is expected the project\n            will help move the poverty reduction agenda forward.\n            Nonetheless, main risk factors include the internal\n            conflict, the Great Lakes regional conflict, the uncertainty\n            of the transition Government's capacity, and readiness\n            to implement reforms, and fund the transition process, as\n            well as the remaining uncertainty regarding the amounts, and\n            timing of inflows of international assistance. These risks\n            will be mitigated largely by the project design, which\n            emphasizes donor coordination, and policies that support\n            national reconciliation, to facilitate progress towards a cease-fire."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Economic Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Economic Rehabilitation\n
