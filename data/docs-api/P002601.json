The two major objectives were: (i) to\n            increase production on a sustainable basis; and (ii) to\n            improve environmental management.  Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory. Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the availability of government funds was essential for the\n            continuation of the project after the suspension of all\n            credit disbursements to Sudan; (ii) it would have been more\n            effective for the Project Management Unit (PMU) to directly\n            contract water and road works; (iii) it is very important\n            that these kind of studies are carried out at the very early\n            stage of a project and it is the GOS view that such an\n            exercise should be standard practice in area development\n            projects; (iv) the satisfactory performance of the project\n            was largely due to the simplicity of design and a rational\n            prioritization of objectives which would have been\n            achievable had the project financing continued as planned;\n            (v) the necessary reformulation of the project helped to\n            develop a low cost option and objectives and expenditure\n            were carefully matched; (vi) construction of hafirs should\n            be considered for manual work in view of labor\u2019s\n            competitiveness to machinery; and (vii) tax collection for\n            road construction from benefitting farmers appears\n            acceptable in the State of Gedaref"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan -
