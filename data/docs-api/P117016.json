In DPLs that are provided in the\n            context of financial crisis to support the macroeconomic\n            stabilization and fiscal constraints, this needs to be\n            explicitly recognized and evaluated to assess its\n            effectiveness. Lack of understanding or experience by the\n            borrower requires factoring in additional time to allow for\n            delays and greater investment in building a better\n            understanding of process and purpose.

Project for St.\n            Lucia were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was substantial;\n            Bank Performance was moderately satisfactory; and borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: a programmatic approach, which supports a\n            multi-stage program with a longer term horizon, is superior\n            to a stand-alone one year program. In small states, policy\n            based programs need to be relatively simple, in terms of\n            realistic scope and targets. Since generally only one policy\n            based operation is prepared in a multi-year period, both the\n            Government and the Bank tend to include many activities in\n            the program. One year is too short a period for\n            implementation of a program, particularly when it is as\n            ambitious as this one. Designing, approving and implementing\n            policy reforms takes time. In addition, a natural disaster\n            or a similar emergency situation could distract the\n            authorities from the program for several months, as it\n            happened in St. Lucia in late 2010. Close supervision,\n            preferably coupled with technical assistance, is\n            instrumental for achieving program outcomes in a one-off\n            DPL. In those operations, where all reforms need to be\n            completed prior to Board approval, the targets and outcome\n            indicators to be met at the end of the program have a\n            somewhat blurry meaning, since no disbursement is triggered\n            by them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia - Economic and Social Development\n            Policy Loan and Credit

Economic and\n            Social Development Policy Loan and Credit Program are to: a)\n            improve the business environment, competitiveness, and\n            strengthen the financial sector, by supporting reforms to\n            reduce delays in starting a business, buttress financial\n            sector regulatory environment, mitigate regional contagion\n            risks, and promote investment; and b) improve public sector\n            governance and economic management, by supporting reforms to\n            improve public service efficiency and performance, increase\n            the efficiency of tax collection, enhance fiscal discipline\n            and strategic allocation of resources, strengthen\n            accountability, and help cope with the adverse consequences\n            of the global economic downturn. The Economic and Social\n            Policy Development Policy Loan and Credit (ES DPL/DPC)\n            provides timely financial support to the Government of St.\n            Lucia to manage the impact of the global economic crisis and\n            to maintain and reinforce the implementation of the\n            longer-term structural reform agenda. St Lucia's\n            economy was hit by hurricane dean and an earthquake in 2007,\n            the fuel and food price increases in 2007 and 2008, and now\n            the global crisis. In addition to the rigidity of the budget\n            due to high debt servicing and wage bill, the fall of fiscal\n            revenues has further limited the Government's room for\n            implementing counter fiscal policies. St Lucia needs\n            financial and technical support to adjust to the\n            deteriorated global environment and to address most urgent\n            social issues. The ES DPL/DPC will help the government in\n            maintaining macroeconomic stability and protecting the poor\n            while enhancing economic and institutional foundations for\n            faster development. Therefore, the ES DPL/DPC supports\n            specific actions to: (i) improve business environment,\n            competitiveness, and strengthen the financial sector; (ii)\n            improve public sector governance and economic management;\n            and (iii) improve effectiveness and efficiency of social\n            safety nets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia - Economic and Social
