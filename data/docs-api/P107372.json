Some lessons\n            learned includes: The project reaffirmed the advantage of\n            the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) as a\n            funding mechanism that encourages programmatic, cross-sector\n            approaches to reform and promotes cooperation among\n            institutions. Channelling resources through the budget was a\n            critical factor in increasing Government ownership of\n            reforms and increasing Government's appetite for\n            seeking on-budget development resources. Client engagement\n            in preparation of project, and adequate time and resources\n            for project design, are critical. The extent of client\n            engagement in project preparation was also an important\n            indicator of future success of the operation. In\n            post-conflict and fragile states, with typically very low\n            internal capacity, the consultation on the project\n            development is a strenuous exercise; however the political\n            and symbolic elements in consultation and design process do\n            pay off, in the end. Political economy analysis may help\n            improve the design by providing tactical insights into\n            client commitment. The performance of the three Justice\n            Institutions (JIs) has been uneven with the Ministry of\n            Justice (MoJ) being the strongest performer in a variety of\n            project execution functions. The main factors defining\n            performance are the degree of 'political capture'\n            and implementation capacity. The uneven performance of the\n            JIs suggests there is therefore a requirement for a\n            'custom designed approach' to future reforms. The\n            project suffered also as a result of the slow implementation\n            of the Human Resource (HR) component in particular, due to a\n            combination of factors such as the lack of an overall\n            approach to HR reform in Afghanistan; an uncoordinated\n            approach by the donors involved; and a lack of perceived\n            incentives to implement reforms. A key lesson is the need\n            for project teams to understand the institutional context\n            and the existing HR environment in which sector\n            interventions are located. Sector interventions that have an\n            HR element need to work with and be integrated into\n            Government's on-going civil service reform programs.\n            Effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) has been a\n            challenge in the justice sector. M&E in the sector has\n            suffered from a lack of technical capacity at the\n            implementation level and weak conceptual capacity at the\n            policy-making level. A lack of M&E strategy, including\n            baseline data, to provide information has made it difficult\n            for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\n            (GoA) to assess properly the achievements and changes. The\n            JIs were initially reluctant to engage international\n            consultants in the implementation of project activities. The\n            high costs of foreign assistance, the presence of\n            'free' international advisors in the JIs (funded\n            by bilateral programs), and concerns related to\n            communication and cultural barriers were the likely reasons\n            for this."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan -

There was at that time a\n            clear understanding that upon the extension of the closing\n            date of the overall ARTF, the closing date of TF would\n            likewise be extended to enable project implementation over a\n            two year period. The restructuring paper seeks the Country\n            Director's approval to extend the closing date for high\n            priority contracts only, for the ARTF financing for the\n            above referenced project by five months and 30 days from the\n            current closing date of June 30, 2011 to December 30, 2011.\n            December 30, 2011 has been chosen as it is the last business\n            day of the month. The purpose of the extension is to: (i)\n            provide more time for completion of on-going and anticipated\n            contracts, full implementation of which have been delayed\n            because of mostly external factors; and (ii) sustain the\n            implementation of continuing activities, implementation of\n            which will continue under the second phase of the Justice\n            Sector Reform Project (JSRP). The restructuring paper also\n            seeks to cancel some of the outstanding balance of the grant\n            in line with the rationale for extending only high priority contracts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan -

There are three\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is enhancing capacity of justice sector\n            institutions. The objective of this component is to enhance\n            the basic operations of the justice institutions.  The\n            target group comprises judges, prosecutors and other justice\n            sector officials, some of whom, by the end of the project,\n            should be able to work under substantially better conditions\n            and possess greater skills related to the resolution of\n            legal disputes.  The eventual beneficiaries of this\n            component will be the people of Afghanistan who receive\n            better services in form of legal dispute resolution. The\n            component has three subcomponents: (a) human capital; (b)\n            physical infrastructure; and (c) information and\n            communication technology. The second component of the\n            project is empowering the people. The objective of this\n            component is to empower the Afghan people through legal aid\n            and education.  The target group for this component is\n            community leaders as well as the wider population,\n            especially those in the most economically vulnerable\n            sections of the Afghan population, together with legal aid\n            providers. Policy makers will also benefit from activities\n            forming part of this component.  The component is divided\n            into two subcomponents: (a) legal aid; and (b) legal\n            awareness. The third component of the project is\n            strengthening implementation capacity. The objective of this\n            component is to build implementation capacity within the\n            justice institutions so that they will, in time, be able to\n            implement reforms and other activities without significant\n            additional assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - First Phase Justice Sector\n            Reform Project (Phase
