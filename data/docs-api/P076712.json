Lessons learned\n            from the project include: Post Conflict Reconstruction: (i)\n            carrying out small-scale activities designed to facilitate\n            the transition from conflict to peace is an effective means\n            to post-conflict development; (ii) the active engagement of\n            civil society can contribute to a better understanding of\n            how conflict can be prevented and actually help prevent such\n            recurrence of conflict; and (iii) confidence and trust can\n            be restored through self-help interventions. Local\n            governments and communities can come together in a\n            participatory manner to promote community development when\n            they perceive potential common benefits. There is a critical\n            need for ensuring that social fund activities are consistent\n            with social sector strategy priorities, government reform\n            programs, and activities of municipal, Non-Governmental\n            Organization (NGO), United Nations (UN), and donor agencies.\n            To improve project sustainability, lessons learned have\n            pointed to a combination of factors including a strong\n            management and administration of project activities under\n            the direction of a PIU, institution building at the local\n            level, greater stakeholder participation, and decentralized\n            monitoring and evaluation. Poverty Targeting: (i) a clearly\n            formulated poverty targeting strategy and an allocation\n            mechanism based on objective criteria and poverty data\n            ensures the flow of project benefits to the neediest\n            segments of the population; (ii) the use of a well developed\n            poverty targeting strategy and an allocation mechanism will\n            mitigate political pressures in the allocation of funds; and\n            (iii) a well developed poverty targeting strategy should\n            have sufficient flexibility, within the overall allocations,\n            to target specific needs on a demand-driven basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Community Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Community
