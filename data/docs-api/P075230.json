Some lessons learned included: close\n            coordination with development partners during preparation\n            and implementation was critical. Complementary technical\n            assistance provided by Australian Agency for International\n            Development (AusAID) and World Health Organization (WHO) was\n            crucial to the development of the sector. The capacity to\n            mobilize financial resources from Japan International\n            Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Bank for the redevelopment\n            of the Vaiola Hospital and the close monitoring of progress\n            of construction packages financed by the two financiers\n            ensured that construction work was completed timely and\n            effectively. The strategy pursued through this Project and\n            through activities financed by AusAID and WHO gives evidence\n            of a balanced choice between visible results in terms of\n            reconstruction and improved service delivery and the\n            development of a health financing policy framework and\n            medium-term planning. The decision by Government and the\n            project team to focus intensively on strengthening of\n            information management and processes, as well as basic\n            computer skills development, for the first half of project\n            implementation before investing in computerized information\n            systems was crucial to maximize the effectiveness of\n            Hospital Information System (HIS) investments, and build\n            user support and buy-in. Institutionalization of important\n            activities such as National Health Account (NHAs) can be\n            achieved with strong commitment from relevant staff and\n            management who understand the benefits for decision making\n            to be derived from the NHAs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tonga - Health Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga - Health

The third component, improving the\n            quality of Vaiola Hospital, will improve the administrative,\n            technical and functional efficiency of Vaiola Hospital by\n            investing in infrastructure redevelopment and management\n            strengthening. This component will focus on three areas:\n            redevelopment of Vaiola Hospital, improving hospital\n            management and developing a health care waste management\n            system.  The fourth component concerns project management\n            and coordination and the operation of the Project Management\n            Unit (PMU)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tonga - Health Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga -

Vaiola Hospital - a\n            redevelopment program, which include facilities\n            infrastructure works. However, the likelihood of asbestos\n            presence in a hazardous form, poses concerns during the\n            renovation process, not only as related to patients, but to\n            the public at large. Moreover, medical wastes generated by\n            health facilities, are considered hazardous materials that\n            may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive, which should be\n            handled in accordance with standard medical, and biomedical\n            waste management disposal practices. The first volume\n            focuses on the issue of asbestos, and offers guidance as\n            follows: should demolition activities generate visible\n            airborne dust, the contractor(s) will cease activities until\n            the dust is controlled, namely by water spraying; and,\n            demolition contractors should include in their bids,\n            techniques to control, and monitor materials of potential\n            environmental concern, such as that in the resilient floor\n            covering, and Transite board materials found at the Vaiola\n            Hospital. Asbestos should be removed from demolition debris,\n            treated as hazardous material, kept adequately wet until\n            disposed of in accordance with international standards. The\n            second volume identifies medical waste management issues,\n            and proposes initially the development of a health care\n            waste management policy, and comprehensive plan, that\n            includes training and public awareness, supported by\n            appropriate legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks.\n            Mitigation measures call for the proper disposal of\n            segregated infectious medical wastes, using options such as\n            autoclave, landfill, and existing incineration, as the case\n            may require. A sanitary wastewater treatment system should\n            be installed at Vaiola Hospital, while the use of\n            disinfected effluents for irrigation, and sanitary sludge\n            composting for soil amendment, should be evaluated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Asbestos survey report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga -

Vaiola Hospital - a\n            redevelopment program, which include facilities\n            infrastructure works. However, the likelihood of asbestos\n            presence in a hazardous form, poses concerns during the\n            renovation process, not only as related to patients, but to\n            the public at large. Moreover, medical wastes generated by\n            health facilities, are considered hazardous materials that\n            may be infectious, toxic, or radioactive, which should be\n            handled in accordance with standard medical, and biomedical\n            waste management disposal practices. The first volume\n            focuses on the issue of asbestos, and offers guidance as\n            follows: should demolition activities generate visible\n            airborne dust, the contractor(s) will cease activities until\n            the dust is controlled, namely by water spraying; and,\n            demolition contractors should include in their bids,\n            techniques to control, and monitor materials of potential\n            environmental concern, such as that in the resilient floor\n            covering, and Transite board materials found at the Vaiola\n            Hospital. Asbestos should be removed from demolition debris,\n            treated as hazardous material, kept adequately wet until\n            disposed of in accordance with international standards. The\n            second volume identifies medical waste management issues,\n            and proposes initially the development of a health care\n            waste management policy, and comprehensive plan, that\n            includes training and public awareness, supported by\n            appropriate legal, regulatory, and policy frameworks.\n            Mitigation measures call for the proper disposal of\n            segregated infectious medical wastes, using options such as\n            autoclave, landfill, and existing incineration, as the case\n            may require. A sanitary wastewater treatment system should\n            be installed at Vaiola Hospital, while the use of\n            disinfected effluents for irrigation, and sanitary sludge\n            composting for soil amendment, should be evaluated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Health care waste management feasibility study"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga - Health Sector Support\n
