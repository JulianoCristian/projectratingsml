The main lessons drawn for the future\n            operations in the road sector include: 1) Nigeria is blessed\n            with numerous experienced highly capable road contractors\n            and engineering consultants. Through the strict application\n            of the Bank's procurement procedures, unqualified firms\n            can be weeded out. 2) Through adequate incentives, including\n            the provision of training, motivated project management\n            units can be created to execute projects. 3) The current\n            set-up for the management and financing of roads in Nigeria\n            is not viable. Any future engagement of the Bank in the road\n            sector in Nigeria should only be considered after the\n            successful implementation of the reforms proposed under the\n            Road Vision 2000 Initiative. 4) After the enactment of the\n            National Roads Board Fund Decree, the Bank should assist\n            preparatory activities for the implementation of the reform.\n            Thereafter, an adaptable program lending might be the right\n            tool to carefully reengage the Bank and to expand the\n            Bank's possible involvement based on clearly defined\n            and agreed upon benchmarks. 5) Possible Bank/International\n            Development Association financing could cover initial\n            years' peak demand of a road recovery program,\n            provision of guarantees for private sector road management\n            concessions, and funding for the rehabilitation of the badly\n            deteriorated rural road

First Multistate Roads Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objective of the project is to\n            support a sustainable improvement program for high priority\n            roads by: (a) creating a capacity for planning and\n            management of the state roads system, including\n            strengthening of the State Ministry of Works and Transport\n            (SMOWT) and (b) developing a road maintenance, upgrading and\n            rehabilitation program, and increasing the use of private\n            contractors.  The project will be a first phase of a\n            national state roads program that could eventually cover\n            most Nigerian states.  It will be executed in two states,\n            Jigawa and Kano, and will include:  (1) road maintenance,\n            rehabilitation and strengthening to reduce the backlog of\n            rehabilitation and strengthening works on priority state\n            roads; (2) road upgrading of selected high priority, high\n            volume unsurfaced roads to appropriate design standards; (3)\n            vehicles and equipment to strengthen institutional capacity\n            to design and supervise the project work; and (4)\n            institutional development to establish appropriate\n            arrangements within the SMOWTs for planning, design,\n            construction and maintenance, including the replacement of\n            force account operations by private contracting for carrying\n            out road maintenance and rehabilitation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - First Multistate Roads Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - First
