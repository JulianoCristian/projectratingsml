Major\n            lessons learned from the project are: 1) Government policy\n            on institutional reform and restructuring of the\n            agricultural services should have been clarified early.\n            Uncertainty over conditions of service and fear of\n            redundancy were genuine concerns of staff, which slowed down\n            the reform process. 2) Key issues should be addressed\n            upfront rather than during project implementation. 3) A\n            legal framework for Agricultural Research and Extension Unit\n            should have been in place at the beginning of the project.\n            4) Setting up Directorate of Agricultural Research and\n            Extension (DARE) as just another unit under the Ministry was\n            not the best arrangement. It would have been preferable to\n            establish DARE as an independent unit right from the start\n            and recruit staff outside of the Ministry. 5) A more\n            pro-active role of the Bank would have been needed to\n            address the problem of poor project implementation in the\n            early years of the project. 6) System modernization from\n            surface to drip irrigation has contributed to substantial\n            savings in water use and greater profitability through\n            improved distribution efficiency. 7) The financial\n            participation of planters in the Western Coast Pilot Project\n            has instilled sense of planter ownership of the project and\n            contributed to its sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius -
