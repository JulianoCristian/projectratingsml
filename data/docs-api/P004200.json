Similarly, while the Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory, that of the Bank is rated unsatisfactory. In\n            addition to lessons reinforcing the need for a clear and\n            simple project design, and, both human and financial\n            resources should be integrated within the design,\n            particularly when those are constrained, through appropriate\n            mitigation measures. In view of the implementation delays\n            experienced during the initial stages of the Project, it is\n            clear that there is a need to maximize continuity within the\n            leadership of the Bank task team. Under the circumstances,\n            there is need to focus on developing Project management\n            skills of our borrowers. On the basis of the sheer volume of\n            indicators selected, it would be useful for both the Bank\n            and Borrower to select indicators which are strategic,\n            meaningful, and attainable. Finally, it is suggested that\n            linking sector support to other programs that address\n            systemic issues, could produce synergies that might increase\n            the chances for better results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao - Health System Reform and Malaria\n            Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lao - Health System Reform and\n            Malaria Control Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6040314/lao-health-system-reform-malaria-control-project","projn":"LA-Health System Reform And Malaria Control\n            Project -- P004200","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050701144353"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Central government administration,Health","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility, agriculture, basic health\n            care, Basic Health Services, communicable diseases,\n            communities, Community Health, Districts, Entomology,\n            epidemiology, expenditures, extension, families, family\n            planning, financial management, health behavior, health\n            care, health centers, Health Education, Health facilities,\n            health outcomes, health programs, health projects, health\n            promotion, health sector, Health Services, health status,\n            HEALTH SYSTEM, health system management, Health system\n            performance, health systems, hospital management, Hospitals,\n            hygiene, immunization, Infant Mortality, Infant Mortality\n            Rate, infants, integration, intervention, MALARIA,\n            malnutrition, medical equipment, morbidity, Mortality,\n            nursing, Parasitology, participatory approaches, patients,\n            pharmacies, poverty reduction, Primary Health Care, private\n            pharmacies, private sector, project report, public health,\n            public sector, public sectors, quality of health care, rural\n            areas, social marketing, supervision, Sustainability,\n            sustainable health care, transport, villages, workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020990-LIAONING URBAN STUDIES,TF022865-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY &\n            PROJECT DEV.,TF023090-PHRD-HEALTH SYSTEM\n            REFORM/MALARIA CNTL,TF025440-FIRST HEALTH PROJECT,TF025920-EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT,TF030675-JAPAN CTF - FY05 GENERAL: GENERAL,TF033592-LAO PDR - HEALTH,TF036941-LOA PEOPLE'S DEM.
