The project was consistent with\n            both Government policy and Bank country strategy. After\n            initial difficulties, the project was effectively\n            implemented with co financiers. Physical targets were fully\n            achieved albeit with a 2.5-year delay. The project benefited\n            from the liberalization of rice pricing and marketing under\n            the concurrent Bank-financed Agricultural Sector Adjustment\n            Credit. These reforms led to higher prices giving farmers a\n            strong incentive to take advantage of the rehabilitation.\n            The expected economic rate of return is 18 percent. After\n            some delays and mistakes, an adequate methodology for\n            rehabilitating schemes was devised and is now implemented.\n            Ministry agents have also gained from that experience and\n            showed a great sense of willingness to draw lessons from\n            past mistakes and difficulties in improving their working methodology."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar
