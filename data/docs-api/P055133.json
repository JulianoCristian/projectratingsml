The\n            assistance was successful in facilitating efforts to\n            repatriate opposition soldiers, refugees, and internally\n            displaced persons. Bank performance was highly satisfactory,\n            while borrower performance was satisfactory. Key lessons\n            learned follow.

      most vulnerable groups, particularly children under the age\n            of eight and pensioners. The Credit will provide\n            non-inflationary financing for the budget. The counterpart\n            funds generated by the Credit will help meet near term costs\n            associated with the peace accord, while maintaining progress\n            toward financial stabilization. Structural measures to be\n            taken include some cost recovery, specifically from\n            increased parent contributions to teacher salaries, employer\n            financing of student's education, and food and drug\n            purchases by patients themselves; the move from a universal\n            bread subsidy to a targeted bread subsidies; and the merging\n            of separate funds into a social protection fund. Beside\n            reducing the arrears for the social safety net, the Credit\n            will finance other expenditures related to resettling\n            refugees, internally displaced peoples,
