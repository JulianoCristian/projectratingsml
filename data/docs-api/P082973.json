Some lessons learned included:\n            the subprojects were selected by the community to solve\n            specific problems. This demand-driven selection process\n            resulted in a piecemeal operation with subprojects financing\n            components or parts of an overall system. Challenges to this\n            approach included difficulties in defining baselines and\n            target quality indicators, a lack of coordination with\n            components outside the subproject that are needed to have\n            the system in operation, and missed opportunities to\n            identify more efficient and cost-effective solutions. To\n            that end, there is a need to include technical assistance\n            and policies that enable the execution of overall system\n            assessments and planning in order to derive investment\n            projects. In an innovative approach to institutional reform,\n            the Project linked institutional reform activities with\n            investments in works. The institutional reform related\n            activities were included as conditions in subproject\n            contracts. As a result, 10 specialized operator and 19\n            public companies were incorporated in the provision of Water\n            Supply and Sanitation (WSS) and technical assistance was\n            provided to identify municipalities to take steps to improve\n            financial viability and accountability and strengthen\n            operation and implementation capacity. Performance\n            indicators and results, however, were not adequately\n            documented during project supervision. There is a need to\n            improve internal capacities at the utility level to collect\n            and report performance indicators, as well as to increase\n            oversight and technical assistance from the Ministry and the\n            Bank to better measure project results and extract lessons\n            learned. The quality of preparation and attention to\n            safeguards at appraisal was reasonably good; however, the\n            Project encountered safeguard issues due to the low capacity\n            at the local level and insufficient oversight. To that end,\n            the Bank and Borrower need to ensure that social and\n            environment specialists are key members of the implementing\n            unit, comprehensive training and instruments (e.g.\n            environmental management plans in construction and\n            supervision contracts) are specified and applied to all\n            levels of the implementing structure (i.e. municipalities,\n            construction supervisors and government), and that specific\n            monitoring indicators are included and follow-up during supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Water and Sanitation Sector\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Water and Sanitation\n            Sector Support

As a result, Colombia has made substantial\n            progress in the expansion of water supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) services. By 2002, urban water supply access was 99\n            percent, rural water supply coverage 71 percent. Sanitation\n            access has also been upgraded with urban coverage of 96\n            percent and rural coverage of 54 percent. Over the years,\n            the World Bank has supported Colombia through advisory work,\n            capacity building and lending.

Consistent with\n            the scope and objectives, the Project will have two\n            components: Component 1 - Municipal Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Infrastructure, to finance investments in the\n            rehabilitation and construction/expansion of primary and\n            secondary water and sewerage networks; investments in water\n            treatment plants, pumping stations and main collectors,\n            wastewater treatment infrastructure including treatment\n            plants and discharge infrastructure; and, construction and\n            implementation supervision at the municipal level through\n            independent supervision consultants. The Component will\n            finance two types of subprojects: a) infrastructure\n            investment subprojects, to be accompanied by technical\n            assistance for utility reform; and, (b) modernization\n            subprojects, which would involve financing of both\n            investment, and the introduction of private sector\n            management for local utilities. Component 2 - Program\n            Management, Benchmarking, Monitoring and Evaluation, to\n            finance consultant services and equipment to strengthen the\n            capacity of the Ministry of environment, Housing and\n            Regional Development (MAVDT) to implement the Project at the\n            central level, and provide technical assistance to the\n            participating municipal utilities. Activities to be financed\n            under this Component include: supply and installation of\n            information technology equipment to allow for an efficient\n            monitoring of utility performance, and program\n            implementation; technical assistance and training to the\n            MAVDT, for Project implementation, monitoring and financial\n            management; and, other operating expenses for the MAVDT, and\n            in particular, The Directorate of Potable Water and Basic\n            Sanitation (DAPSBA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Water and Sanitation Sector\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Water and Sanitation\n            Sector Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5622752/colombia-water-sanitation-sector-support-project","projn":"CO-Water And Sanitation Sector Support\n            Project 1st Apl -- P082973","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Health Economics & Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050224101311"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Basic Sanitation, Bidding, civil society,\n            construction, demographic growth, efficient use,\n            environmental benefits, Environmental Engineering,\n            Environmental Impact Assessment, Environmental Improvement,\n            environmental management, environmental monitoring,\n            equilibrium, Exchange Rate, health outcomes, income,\n            Infrastructure Services, institutional capacity,\n            International Standards, laws, legal framework, local\n            authorities, municipal solid waste, Municipal Water Supply,\n            national laws, PH, Pollution, Potable Water, poverty line,\n            Present Value, PRIVATE SECTOR, Procurement, project\n            management, public goods, public service delivery, public\n            services, public utilities, pumping, pumping stations, PVC,\n            quality standards, rural water, Rural water supply, safe\n            water, sanitary landfills, SANITATION, sanitation coverage,\n            SANITATION SECTOR, sanitation services, scale economies,\n            screening, service delivery, service providers, service\n            provision, Sewerage, solid waste, solid waste management,\n            street cleaning, Structural Adjustment, Sustainable Growth,\n            urban areas, urban centers, urban water, waste management,\n            wastewater, wastewater disposal, wastewater treatment, water\n            quality, water treatment, water treatment plants"}},"owner":"Water & Sanitation Cluster (LCSFW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"29601"},"facets":{}}}
