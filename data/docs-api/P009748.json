The project was approved on June 26, 1979\n            and signed on August 20, 1979. A condition of loan\n            effectiveness was the appointment of the ammonia plant\n            engineering consultants. The effective date was postponed\n            eight times up to December 31, 1980 pending the final\n            decision by the Indian Cabinet. The Cabinet's decision\n            was made in August 1980 which reversed the recommendations\n            made by the implementing agency. Thereafter, the Bank\n            requested to review the evaluation procedure and criteria\n            and found them unacceptable because of shortcomings in the\n            technical qualification of the selected firm. The Bank was\n            also apprehensive about the methods and procedures followed\n            by the Government in arriving at its final decision, which\n            were considered contrary to the representations made during\n            loan negotiations. Since the condition of the loan regarding\n            the appointment of consultants could not be met, the Bank\n            withdrew the loan. Therefore, the project is not rated and\n            no audit is planned.
