Loan effectiveness was\n            delayed, and a fire destroyed the bleaching chemical plant\n            in the pulp mill in 1982. Also, external markets of pine and\n            eucalyptus were poor. The Bank dropped the pulpwood\n            plantation component and cancelled part of the loan in 1984.\n            Other plantation components made little progress during the\n            first two years of the project. Senior managerial changes, a\n            weak technical assistance team, and a shortage of operating\n            funds were among other problems. The Government proposed a\n            re-designed project which was accepted by the Bank in 1985.\n            However, in spite of the apparent will of the project\n            management and the Bank to make the project work, the\n            physical results since 1986 have also been problematic. Poor\n            soils and fire damage afflicted the new woodlots. The\n            national economy cannot continue to sustain public sector\n            parastatals involved in the types of activities supported by\n            this project. The Bank supervised the project as the\n            situation warranted, although it emphasized recruitment\n            while neglecting to plan for fire protection. The Borrower\n            was supportive but did not fulfill its commitment to provide\n            adequate funds. The primary lesson learned is that the\n            project designers failed to support and encourage tree\n            planting by the private sector when it concentrated on\n            Government plantations. Other lessons include: (a) the\n            number of agencies involved in a project needs to be kept to\n            a minimum and progress must be closely monitored throughout;\n            (b) when the pulpwood plantation was dropped and other\n            components made little progress, the project should have\n            been re-appraised or closed; (c) a project should not depend\n            too strongly on technical assistance and the Government\n            needs to be involved in project design and execution; and\n            (d) the risks of fire in the arid zone plantations need to\n            be adequately dealt with in implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
