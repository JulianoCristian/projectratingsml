The Project aimed to help\n            increase the competitiveness and growth of micro and small\n            businesses (MSBs) in poor urban areas of Mexico through the\n            adoption of e-business. This was to be achieved through two\n            components. The first was to focus on building an e-business\n            development services markets for MSBs via (a) an e-business\n            benefits awareness program, (b) an e-learning and innovation\n            program providing demand-side matching grants for business\n            development services (BDS) providing information, training,\n            market access and technology appropriate to MSB needs to\n            adopt e-business solutions, (c) a supply-side business\n            centers innovation pilot in ICT-based BDS providing distance\n            learning, new market access, management tools, and online\n            trading to reduce transaction costs, and (d) an E-BDS\n            innovation pilot for the promotion of new employment of\n            urban at-risk youth through ICT-based training and job\n            placement. The second component targeted improvements in MSB\n            access to ICT infrastructure and e-government business\n            services by (a) extending Internet services to MSBs and to\n            reducing regulations so as to increase innovation and\n            competitiveness, and (b) simplifying institutional practices\n            associated with business regulations involving registration,\n            operating licenses and inspections, labor and tax\n            registration and Internet-enabling government services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
