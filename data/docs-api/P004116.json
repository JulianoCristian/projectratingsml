This\n            component of the project will also support overseas training\n            of selected SMIPC and SMI staff.  The credit component of\n            the loan will help cover the foreign exchange requirements\n            of subprojects financed by SMIB and CNB from mid-1985 to\n            mid-1987 and will support the continued institutional\n            development of SMIB and CNB.  The project will also promote\n            the development of improved subcontracting policies, which\n            is important to SMI development in Korea where large\n            companies have the potential to play a major role in\n            assisting smaller firms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Small and Medium Industry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Small and Medium Industry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/03/741377/korea-small-medium-industry-project","projn":"KR-Sm./Med.Industries -- P004116","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Korea, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970818101358"},"subsc":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise-IL","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,assets,auditing,Balance Sheet,Balance\n            Sheets,bank lending,Bank loans,Bank of Korea,Banking\n            System,banks,Basic metals,Bonds,capital requirements,Cash\n            Flow Statements,CoaL,commercial banks,competitive\n            advantage,competitiveness,consumers,Cooperative Banks,credit\n            markets,credit unions,crowding\n            out,debt,deposits,deregulation,developed\n            countries,Development Strategy,economic efficiency,economic\n            growth,Economic Impact,economic policies,economic rate of\n            return,economies of scale,employment,exports,Fair\n            Trade,financial intermediaries,Financial Policies,Financial\n            Sector,FISCAL YEAR,Fisheries,foreign banks,foreign\n            exchange,GNP,Housing,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,inflation,inflation rate,inflation\n            rates,institutional development,insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,internal cash generation,international\n            trade,KDB,Land Development,laws,lending institutions,lending\n            rates,Loan commitments,long-term capital,merchant\n            banks,nonbank financial institutions,oil,operational\n            risks,policy environment,producers,Production\n            Technology,productivity,quality standards,Rapid\n            industrialization,regulatory framework,savings,savings\n            institutions,Small Business,specialized banks,Structural\n            Adjustment,Technical Assistance,time deposits,trade\n            liberalization,Value added,wage rates,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,assets,auditing,Balance Sheet,Balance\n            Sheets,bank lending,Bank loans,Bank of Korea,Banking\n            System,banks,Basic metals,Bonds,capital requirements,Cash\n            Flow Statements,CoaL,commercial banks,competitive\n            advantage,competitiveness,consumers,Cooperative Banks,credit\n            markets,credit unions,crowding\n            out,debt,deposits,deregulation,developed\n            countries,Development Strategy,economic efficiency,economic\n            growth,Economic Impact,economic policies,economic rate of\n            return,economies of scale,employment,exports,Fair\n            Trade,financial intermediaries,Financial Policies,Financial\n            Sector,FISCAL YEAR,Fisheries,foreign banks,foreign\n            exchange,GNP,Housing,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,inflation,inflation rate,inflation\n            rates,institutional development,insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,internal cash generation,international\n            trade,KDB,Land Development,laws,lending institutions,lending\n            rates,Loan commitments,long-term capital,merchant\n            banks,nonbank financial institutions,oil,operational\n            risks,policy environment,producers,Production\n            Technology,productivity,quality standards,Rapid\n            industrialization,regulatory framework,savings,savings\n            institutions,Small Business,specialized banks,Structural\n            Adjustment,Technical Assistance,time deposits,trade\n            liberalization,Value added,wage rates,working capital"}},"owner":"East Asia & Pacific Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"5378"},"facets":{}}}
