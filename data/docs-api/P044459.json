The lessons learned\n            can be summarized as follows: (a) emergency projects should\n            be of low complexity. Contracting of housing repairs is more\n            efficient than the bulk supply of building materials; (b)\n            the policy content of emergency projects should be limited\n            to cost recovery objectives which need to be brought in\n            harmony with the social post-war context and with other\n            donors active in the country, (c) in parallel or shortly\n            after emergency projects are established, economic sector\n            work should be initiated; (d) emergency projects should be\n            of modular nature, allowing for continuous adjustments to\n            project size and scope; (f) highly qualified borrower\n            personnel should be appointed already during project\n            preparation; (g) the project unit of the borrower should\n            enjoy a large degree of autonomy in its day-to-day\n            operations; (h) continuous technical assistance should be\n            built into emergency projects from preparation through the\n            first year of implementation; (i) delegation of project\n            supervision to Bank staff located in a field office is\n            essential to ensure timely client service; (j) streamlined\n            procurement guidelines and accelerated disbursement\n            procedures are important further ingredients for speedy\n            implementation; and (k) donor confidence in emerging\n            governmental project management units should be strengthened\n            through special procurement reviews as well as technical and\n            financial audits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Housing\n            Repair Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -\n
