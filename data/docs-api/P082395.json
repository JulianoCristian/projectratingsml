The findings indicate that the original goals\n            of the reform continue to be valid and second and third\n            phases of the Human Development Reform Loan (HDRP) are\n            clearly warranted to achieve them. Although it did not fully\n            prepare the second phase of the program as anticipated, the\n            first phase provided valuable lessons and insights that\n            should be accounted for in the second and third phases. As\n            originally designed, Social Security Administration (IESS)\n            was expected to be a major instrument in reaching program\n            goals. It was directly involved in completing 6 monitorable\n            actions, including two triggers for a second stage. Reforms\n            are underway to restore economic and financial stability in\n            Ecuador. Technical Secretariat of the Interministerial\n            Social Sectors Committee (STFS) has established a sound\n            record in monitoring and motivating the program to date, and\n            should continue this role in the future. It is clear that\n            steps taken to coordinate existing agencies has not led to\n            desired breadth of reform proposals needed to successfully\n            address pension reforms and reform of nutritional and food\n            security programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - First Programmatic Human\n            Development Reform Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - First Programmatic\n            Human Development Reform Operation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4971576/ecuador-first-programmatic-human-development-reform-operation-project","projn":"EC-First Programmatic Human Dev.

Interventions for the specific\n            benefit of indigenous groups will be incorporated into the\n            project design, and, this Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP)\n            summarizes specific actions to these efforts.

Both the\n            World Bank and IMF are providing financial assistance to\n            this effort. Concurrently, the Government has committed\n            itself to protect and enhance social sector spending and\n            program efficiency in the immediate term, and initiate\n            reforms in key social sectors -health, social protection,\n            and education- to provide a regulatory and institutional\n            platform for medium and longer-term structural improvements\n            in those areas. This project would be the first phase of the\n            Bank's support to achieving these goals. The HDRL, like\n            the overall program would focus on three critical aspects of\n            social service reforms: (i) protecting and enhancing\n            Ecuador's public sector investment in social sectors by\n            supporting rationalized institutional budgets and financing\n            for key social programs; (ii) increasing the efficiency and\n            effectiveness of social programs through refocusing program\n            objectives, improving targeting of social services, raising\n            consistency in their administration, and promoting resource\n            sharing among institutions; and (iii) enhancing the public\n            consultations, transparency and accountability in the\n            implementation of social programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Programmatic Human Development\n            Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador - Programmatic Human\n            Development Reform Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/04/2351843/ecuador-programmatic-human-development-reform-loan-project","projn":"EC-First Programmatic Human Dev.
