Some lessons learned\n            included: agreeing on the structure and development of new\n            information management systems for the forest sector,\n            programming the software, and instituting the proper use of\n            those new systems can take considerable time. At appraisal,\n            very few cost-effective systems existed. For future Forest\n            Management Information and Monitoring System (FMIMS)\n            developments, off-the-shelf systems are now available at\n            reasonable costs. In recent years, the Bank has been\n            hesitant to invest in forestry, and in particular, road\n            activities because of heightened non-government organization\n            (NGO) attention. Because of the generally good outcomes of\n            this project, especially with access roads, and the strong\n            environmental and social linkages, this positive experience\n            could offer an important lesson for the Bank both in terms\n            of how to engage NGOs in seeking a way forward, but also in\n            addressing critical safeguards issues. A lesson emerging\n            from the project is that small-scale forest owners may\n            require initial incentives to form associations and grow,\n            such as training and technical support, accessing financing\n            through a revolving fund partially funded through member\n            contributions, tapping new forest carbon funds, etc. It is\n            important that at effectiveness, projects have made good\n            progress to establish a robust monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system with a baseline, plus a program and format\n            for regular collection of data on input/outputs, processes,\n            institutional development, impacts and outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -

To this end, project\n            components will: 1) Establish new systems to ensure\n            sustainable management of private forest lands, by\n            strengthening the Department of Forests, specifically, the\n            Forest Inspectorate and Support Service within the Ministry\n            of Agriculture, Food and Forests (MAFF). Supervisory,\n            regulatory, and monitoring activities in forest management,\n            will be supported, as will the provision of extension, and\n            advisory services. Furthermore, support will be provided for\n            the development of national, and local associations of\n            private forest owners, which includes assistance for\n            business development plans, service delivery, and capacity\n            building in financial, and procurement management. In\n            addition, a national forest management information, and\n            monitoring system will be established to integrate cadastre,\n            forest inventory, and biodiversity data. 2) Mitigate the\n            State's forests management restitution, and its\n            consequences, by supporting reform, and strategic\n            development of the National Forest Administration, and,\n            through the rehabilitation, and extension of the forest road\n            network. 3) Support the increased productivity, and\n            competitiveness of forest industries, through the\n            establishment of the Forest Sector Business Information\n            Center, to coordinate, and assist timber, and related forest\n            industries. 4) Build public support for sustainable forest\n            management, through public awareness campaigns. 5) Support\n            project management, and financial activities, and oversee\n            monitoring and evaluation aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Forest Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Forest Development

status, trends, and\n            institutional capacity for forest management in Romania, and\n            key issues of the National Forest Policy, and Strategy. It\n            assessed the project environmental impacts and proposed\n            mitigation measures. Although the project will have\n            positive, beneficial impacts, there are aspects which could\n            have negative environmental, and social consequences if\n            mitigation is not implemented. Adverse environmental\n            impacts, and mitigating measures are as follows.\n            Institutional recommendations suggest capacity building -\n            formal, and on-the-job training, public awareness, etc. - to\n            ensure compliance with environmental policies, including the\n            involvement of public-private partnerships, to support an\n            enabling environment. The main concern is the Forest Roads\n            component, which involves road construction and\n            rehabilitation in the area: baseline conditions, site\n            selection, and engineering design will be reviewed to\n            minimize adversity. Also, poorly managed forestry harvests\n            may be endangered by increased timber industry demand, if\n            institutional capacity measures, and public-private\n            partnerships do not exercise regulations, a risk greatest in\n            the case of newly restituted forest lands. The update\n            volumes clarify issues and incorporate recommendations\n            raised by NGOs, detail information disclosure, further\n            examine illegal harvesting, and expands on the reasons for\n            rejecting alternative projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment update : summary\n            and main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania
