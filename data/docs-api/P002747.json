The objectives of the project\n            were (i) to promote agricultural exports in the traditional\n            crop sector (coffee, tea, sisal, cashewnuts, cotton and\n            tobacco) through a medium/long-term credit for\n            rehabilitation, thereby increasing foreign exchange\n            earnings; (ii) to provide greater emphasis to market forces\n            to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and, (iii)\n            to advance institution building by strengthening the\n            capability of the Cooperative and Rural Development Bank\n            (CRDB) to engage in medium- and long-term lending in the\n            agricultural sector.  Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (i) it was unreasonable\n            to have expected significant restructuring of CRDB without\n            the political will that was not evident until after the\n            enactment of the Banking and Financial Institutions Act\n            (1991); (ii) CRDB was able to make multiple loans (up to 4)\n            to individual sub-borrowers, and to considerably exceed the\n            individual loan limits established at appraisal without\n            evidence of enterprise profitability or management\n            commitment; (iii) commercial businesses require a timely and\n            efficient banking service for effective and profitable\n            operation and CRDB was not always able to provide this\n            service; (iv) a mid-term review is an essential tool at\n            which an independent assessment can be made of project\n            progress; (v) supervision missions for agricultural credit\n            programmes should consider the inclusion of technical; and\n            (vi) the absence of formal supervision from November 1991\n            until February 1994, at a critical period of both\n            sub-borrower development and CRDB restructure, may have\n            contributed to the poor performance of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Agricultural Export\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Agricultural Export\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/12/732031/tanzania-agricultural-export-rehabilitation-project","count":"Tanzania","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,administrative costs,agricultural\n            credit,agricultural lending,Agriculture,auditors,balance of\n            payments,bank lending,Bank of Tanzania,Bank Performance,bank\n            supervision,banking\n            system,BORROWER,borrowings,commitment,commitments,credit\n            risk,credit risk\n            management,debt,decentralization,Development\n            Banking,development\n            strategy,disbursement,Disbursements,economic\n            justification,economic rate of return,Economic\n            Reform,employment,exports,feasibility studies,financial\n            information,financial institutions,financial\n            intermediaries,financial management,financial sector,fiscal\n            policy,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,grace period,IDA\n            Credit,Institutional Development,interest\n            rate,legislation,lending\n            operations,liquidity,litigation,loan,loan agreements,loan\n            default,loan disbursements,loan loss reserves,loan\n            repayments,loan size,loan supervision,macroeconomic\n            management,macroeconomic policies,operating\n            costs,Portfolio,price controls,private\n            banks,privatization,profit margins,resource\n            allocation,return on\n            assets,subborrowers,subloans,subsidiary,subsidiary loan\n            agreement,technical assistance,venture capital,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,administrative costs,agricultural\n            credit,agricultural lending,Agriculture,auditors,balance of\n            payments,bank lending,Bank of Tanzania,Bank Performance,bank\n            supervision,banking\n            system,BORROWER,borrowings,commitment,commitments,credit\n            risk,credit risk\n            management,debt,decentralization,Development\n            Banking,development\n            strategy,disbursement,Disbursements,economic\n            justification,economic rate of return,Economic\n            Reform,employment,exports,feasibility studies,financial\n            information,financial institutions,financial\n            intermediaries,financial management,financial sector,fiscal\n            policy,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,grace period,IDA\n            Credit,Institutional Development,interest\n            rate,legislation,lending\n            operations,liquidity,litigation,loan,loan agreements,loan\n            default,loan disbursements,loan loss reserves,loan\n            repayments,loan size,loan supervision,macroeconomic\n            management,macroeconomic policies,operating\n            costs,Portfolio,price controls,private\n            banks,privatization,profit margins,resource\n            allocation,return on\n            assets,subborrowers,subloans,subsidiary,subsidiary loan\n            agreement,technical assistance,venture capital,working capital"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"majtheme":"Trade and integration,Rural development","projn":"TZ-Agr.Exports Reh.
