Some lessons learned included: management\n            contracts, performance indicators, monitoring, supervision,\n            and evaluation are crucial to successful project\n            implementation. There is also a need for further\n            decentralized management and accountability. Competent and\n            stable project management is necessary for continuity of the\n            project in a changing political environment. In the early\n            1990s political appointees in a volatile political\n            environment almost brought the project to a halt. Flexible\n            project design and interpretation of the loan agreement are\n            necessary so that projects can be adapted to new\n            environmental and political realities which may arise during\n            the long period of project implementation.
