Some lessons learned included: the project\n            aimed at reconstructing parts of Sierra Leone's\n            dilapidated infrastructure by means of rehabilitated assets,\n            expanding capacity, and enhancing institutions in several\n            sectors. Despite being conceived as a multi-sectoral\n            project, the project did not include any multi-sectoral\n            component. Implementation was carried out by two different\n            teams with different Team Task Leader (TTLs) without\n            coordination, which compromised the quality of supervision.\n            The commitment of the Government to essential reforms in\n            Sierra Leone was weak, as evidenced by the lack of support\n            to a management contract for National Power Authority (NPA)\n            and the lack of clarity regarding the competent authority\n            for solid waste management in Freetown. These circumstances\n            added to the poor improvement of NPA's performance and\n            solid waste collection in Freetown. The project design\n            should be as simple as possible in a post-conflict context\n            where there are a vast number of needs to be fulfilled.\n            Design also needs to take into account the capacity of the\n            implementation agencies so that the Project Development\n            Objectives (PDO) is achievable. Also, the Bank needs to\n            provide a focal point in the post-conflict country to\n            enhance communication and facilitate project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone -

      development approach. It is intended to address prioritized\n            issues across different infrastructure services - water and\n            sanitation, urban waste management and power - taking into\n            account all other donor commitments, and ongoing or planned\n            programs. Implementation of the project will necessarily\n            entail reallocation, and resettlement of people living in,\n            and around the project area, thus, the primary aim of this\n            policy resettlement framework is to set out a strategic\n            response to the challenges of involuntary resettlement,\n            which potentially can be anticipated, and facilitate proper\n            decision making, and the mobilization of resources. Cash\n            compensations for land losses will be based on market\n            values, or as recommended by the Bank, at land replacement\n            costs. Land tenants shall be entitled to compensation based\n            upon land under statute, while land users, will be entitled\n            to compensation for crop losses, entitled to land\n            replacement, and income restoration. Housing and physical\n            structures will be compensated in cash ay market values, or\n            in-kind compensations at full replacement costs, including\n            labor and relocation expenses prior to displacement.\n            Perennial crop losses will be compensated in cash, upon\n            rates calculated as the one year net agricultural income.\n            Business and income losses compensation shall be covered by\n            payment of half of turnover, for six months.
