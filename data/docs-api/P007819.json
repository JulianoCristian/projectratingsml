The\n            strategy aims at creating new growth opportunities by\n            reorienting the economy towards accelerated production of\n            goods for export by the private sector. The main areas\n            covered include: (i) greater efficiency in both the\n            allocation of resources within the public sector and\n            reduction of its scope; (ii) measures to stimulate greater\n            exports orientation and increased employment in the\n            manufacturing sector; and (iii) a new agricultural policy\n            geared towards greater efficiency and a higher volume of\n            goods for export. Supported by the technical assistance\n            project, the government would also undertake a series of\n            studies and technical assistance designed to strengthen the\n            Social
