In aggregate the\n            active number assisted (2,926) was less than the targeted\n            appraisal number (3,800). A certain number of veterans were\n            trained but there is no evidence they actually were employed\n            (anecdotally, it appears they were not) and a small number\n            of disabled were assisted. The micro grant component had to\n            be cancelled after violence committed by ex-combatants in\n            light of the small amount of funds set aside for it and\n            charges of bias in its allocation to individuals, who tended\n            to view it as a cash entitlement rather than a program to\n            establish a means of livelihood. There is little evidence\n            that few, if any, of the former rebels benefited at all and\n            it is reported there is resentment that such benefits as\n            there were accrued largely to former government troops.\n            Project sustainability is unlikely: With the closing of the\n            IDA credit the project unit was disbanded and staff were let\n            go or reassigned elsewhere in the government. Under an\n            ongoing EU program, demobilization payments continue to be\n            made to veterans, but all efforts to reintegrate them\n            socially and economically have ceased. There is no ongoing\n            effort on the part of the government of Djibouti to continue\n            the kinds of intervention foreseen under the project,\n            although there is a recognition that further cost to the\n            military and police force are needed. Overall Bank\n            performance is rated unsatisfactory. Regular and flexible\n            supervision of projects can only rarely overcome operations\n            which are not adequately designed to reflect the local\n            context. Borrower performance, initially unsatisfactory, was\n            at project end satisfactory. It is worth emphasizing in\n            particular the effective problem solving of the\n            implementation team in the face of what were at times life\n            threatening situations. As the international community and\n            the Bank Group in particular are increasingly faced with\n            difficult post conflict situations, a number of lessons from\n            this experience in Djibouti are especially timely. 1) As was\n            foreseen at appraisal, the lesson is that, however desirable\n            it may be in principle, in the short term it is wrong to\n            expect opposing sides in a civil war can be reintegrated\n            simultaneously in the same community. Reintegration into\n            their own ethnic (in this case) community must precede\n            reintegration into a wider community. It is also important\n            to treat each side in the conflict equitably. 2) post\n            conflict needs to be fully part of a coherent country\n            strategy in which there is focussed attention to policy\n            reform. In the absence of that, while it may be possible to\n            demobilize, it will not be possible to reintegrate, and\n            there is no role for the Bank (demobilization can be left to\n            bilateral donors). 3) Learning and Innovation Credits are an\n            important tool in the Bank Group's arsenal of\n            intervention. The Bank took a calculated risk in the\n            operation to try to assist a disadvantaged group in\n            Djibouti. The fact that it failed does not invalidate the\n            usefulness of the instrument."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti - Ex-Combatants Reintegration Pilot
