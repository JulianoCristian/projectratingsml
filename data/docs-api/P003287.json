The\n            key lessons include: 1) The provision of links with markets\n            by the extension service proved to be an important incentive\n            for promoting the production of forest products and other\n            wood-based production, and ensuring the long term\n            sustainability of these activities, among rural communities.\n            2) Adequate farmer training and technical back-up, as well\n            as access to a good seed bank are essential for the\n            successful promotion of seedling production and tree\n            planting programs. 3) In the absence of supervisory capacity\n            in the executing agency, turnkey engineering packages should\n            be considered when undertaking a complex construction\n            operation such as the Chimanimani saw mill. 4) To minimize\n            delays, project implementation procedures and standards\n            should be established early in the project and it is\n            critical to ensure that all interested parties are familiar\n            with these. 5) Synchronization of supervision missions from\n            different donor agencies could have resulted in better\n            co-ordination of activities. 6) Development indicators\n            should be defined at the outset of the project to ensure\n            consistency and accuracy in measuring the success of project\n            activities in achieving the intended development activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe -
