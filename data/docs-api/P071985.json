Ratings were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was significant, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. The project components were not\n            revised but changes were made at the sub-component level,\n            with some cancellation or addition of activities from the\n            original design.  Some lessons learned were in the areas of\n            Institutional Reforms and Human Resource Capacity: Use the\n            Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument as a tool for\n            deepening reforms. Use of Additional Financing in place of\n            stand-alone project. Monitoring and Evaluation. Role for the\n            Bank in the road sector. Lack of foreign competition to the\n            local road Engineering, Procurement and Construction\n            companies (EPCs) in Zambia.
