Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to maintain flexibility of the DPL series to adapt to\n            current realities/priorities and to respond to economic\n            crisis by focusing on the important sectors.

document presents the first\n            in the series of up to three Programmatic Private and\n            Financial Development Policy Loans (PFDPLs) to the Republic\n            of Serbia to support the government's structural reform\n            program. The objective of the PFDPLs is to support three\n            policy areas: (i) further improve the business environment\n            to encourage new business and to attract foreign direct\n            investments (FDI); (ii) strengthen financial discipline by\n            enhancing hard budget constraints in the enterprise sector\n            through privatization or bankruptcy, of large Socially-Owned\n            Enterprise (SOE), and the restructuring of public utilities;\n            and (iii) build a more efficient and stable financial sector\n            through continuing the divestment of state ownership in the\n            banking and insurance sectors, enhancing prudential\n            supervision of banking and encouraging development of the\n            capital markets.  The PFDPL is designed to support the\n            government in advancing its financial and private sector\n            related reforms. It is envisioned to be complemented by\n            another Development Policy Loan (DPL) operation aimed at\n            supporting Serbia's public expenditure management. The\n            policy actions set in the PFDPL program will largely\n            conclude the era of fast-track transition reforms in private\n            and financial sectors of the Serbian economy. The private\n            and financial sector reforms outside the PFDPL context will\n            require a shift from immediate, near-term needs to medium-\n            and longer-term
