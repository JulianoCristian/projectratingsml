Throughout the\n            implementation of the project, relations between the\n            association of the Government of Pakistan (GOP) and OGDC\n            have been good. The most important contribution of the\n            Association took place during project supervision. The Toot\n            Oil and Gas Development Project is the most closely\n            supervised petroleum project to date. The experience of the\n            project can be considered as another example showing the\n            difficulty of bringing about institutional improvement in\n            the absence of strong commitment on the part of the\n            Borrower/Beneficiary. The underlying cause of OGDC's\n            institutional weakness is the fact that it remains a\n            government agency working closely under the direction and\n            supervision of the concerned ministry but charged with the\n            responsibilities in a field where operating autonomy and\n            both financial and management independence are standard.\n            Therefore, pending a change in the institutional character\n            of OCDC, the main thrust of the institution building\n            measures will need to be in strengthening OGDC's\n            management practices and accounting and management\n            information functions. Some meaningful progress in these\n            directions was achieved during project implementation.\n            However, the concerted efforts of the last few years will\n            need to be continued to establish OGDC as a capable and\n            competent national oil company."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

the Toot field; assist OGDC in strengthening its\n            capabilities in the effective conduct of oil operations; and\n            provide the means for evaluating the potential of the\n            recently discovered Dhodak field and preparing for its rapid\n            exploitation. Major project components include: the drilling\n            of eight wells and provision of surface facilities at Toot;\n            logistic support (heavy road transport equipment and a cargo\n            aircraft) for OGDC; a seismic survey and reserve evaluation\n            at Dhodak; provision of instructors and equipment for the\n            Oil & Gas Training Institute; and management and\n            accounting consultancy services for OGDC.
