Key lessons learned are: Borrower\n            ownership of the program, commitment to its objectives, and\n            the drive for results are critical to the successful\n            implementation of an ambitious structural reform program.\n            The close cooperation between the World bank and the\n            Government was instrumental in ensuring design quality and\n            effective project. It was determined initially that a core\n            set of up-front actions, including the adoption of major new\n            legislation, was essential to ensuring effective\n            implementation and sustainability of the program's\n            objectives. Insistence on this principle extended the period\n            preceding the Board presentation; and this period was used\n            very effectively to refine the program, gain political\n            support at the highest levels in the country, and advance\n            bank and enterprise privatization. From the outset, the\n            Government determined to sell State-owned enterprises and\n            banks to strategic investors who could bring in the\n            necessary capital and know-how and provide appropriate\n            governance. Putting in place a modern regulatory and\n            supervisory framework is crucial to reforming the financial\n            sector, but does not itself guarantee effective financial\n            sector supervision. While political independence and strong\n            regulatory and supervisory powers can be provided relatively\n            rapidly by passing appropriate legislation, the development\n            of supervisory skills, culture, and confidence is longer-term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan

           to support Hungary's efforts to implement effective\n            reform of its enterprise and financial sectors. The loan\n            will provide fast-disbursing funds for balance-of-payments\n            assistance for the government's reform program. The\n            government will aim to maintain a stable macroeconomic\n            framework within which essential structural reforms can be\n            implemented, especially those which will accelerate bank and\n            enterprise privatization. The reform program's main\n            components include: (1) an enterprise privatization program\n            targeting substantial reduction of remaining State shares in\n            enterprises, particularly in large utilities over the\n            1995-97 period; (2) a strong program to curtail and reduce\n            enterprise losses, and help free resources for projects of\n            much higher returns; (3) comprehensive legal and regulatory\n            development in the banking sector designed to preserve\n            financial discipline and to ensure that scarce resources are\n            effectively allocated to the most dynamic enterprises; and\n            (4) radical improvement in bank governance in the context of\n            a bank privatization program aimed at privatizing all\n            remaining State-owned banks by 1997's end."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan
