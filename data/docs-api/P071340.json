On\n            September 30, 2013, the Panel received a request for\n            inspection of the Nigeria: Lagos Metropolitan Development\n            and Governance Project ('the Project'), and after\n            consulting with the requesters and management, the Panel\n            decided to consider this case under the Pilot approach. In\n            addition to presenting the results of the case in the\n            context of the Pilot, this note also provides insights into\n            the issues that arose during the Panel's assessment of\n            the case and the lessons that emerged from it. The Request\n            for Inspection ('the request') was submitted by\n            the Social and Economic Rights Action Center (SERAC) in\n            Lagos, on behalf of 'individuals, families and groups\n            living in the Badia area of Lagos State' alleging that\n            the project has caused the 'impoverishment and\n            insecurity' of Badia residents, a vulnerable slum\n            community in Lagos, as a result of evictions that have\n            occurred under the Project 'without prior consultation,\n            notice, compensation or resettlement.' The requesters\n            believe that they have suffered serious harm as a result of\n            actions and omissions of the World Bank. They state that the\n            Bank is 'clearly obliged to ensure that the project is\n            implemented in accordance with its own operational policies\n            and to hold Lagos State to its commitments under the LMDGP\n            Project Agreement.' They add that on February 23, 2013,\n            again, hundreds of structures were demolished in the area of\n            Badia East immediately adjoining the canal mentioned above,\n            forcefully evicting about 9.000 inhabitants. According to\n            the Requesters, both incidences occurred without prior\n            consultation, notice, compensation or resettlement and\n            resulted in their further impoverishment. They add that\n            since February 23, 2013, no relief or emergency aid measures\n            have been provided to mitigate the extreme suffering of\n            thousands of affected people. The Request refers to a number\n            of interactions in which these concerns have been raised\n            with World Bank representatives between March 2012 and July 2013."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -

Some lessons learned included:\n            Bank teams should be cognizant of the prevailing political\n            economy and calibrate the complexity of projects\n            accordingly. A stand-alone case study is carried out to\n            extract lessons learned from LMDGP in a more systematic\n            manner, provide in-depth analysis of the modalities of urban\n            sector engagements in a mega-city like Lagos, and make\n            recommendations towards the structure and manner of\n            engagement in such settings. Projects well vested into\n            existing institutions are less vulnerable to the presence of\n            political capital and may be better suited for complex\n            environments like that of Lagos. Simultaneous deployment of\n            various lending instruments proved to be effective in\n            achieving desired outcomes. Lack of transfer of knowledge,\n            right skill mix, and appropriate background in task team\n            leaders (TTLs) and sector specialists affects the\n            relationship with the client and poses a risk to\n            implementation. When the Bank's and the client's\n            commitment to safeguards policies and their practical\n            implementation diverges significantly, both the Bank and the\n            client should be upfront and eliminate instances where\n            investments will trigger such policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -

The Request was sent by a civil society\n            organization based in Lagos on behalf of individuals,\n            families, and groups living in the Badia area of Lagos\n            State. The requesters believe that they have suffered\n            serious harm as a result of actions and omissions of the\n            World Bank. They state that the Bank is clearly obliged to\n            ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with\n            its own operational policies and to hold Lagos State to its\n            commitments under the LMDGP agreement. The requesters claim,\n            that the evictions and demolitions have resulted in further\n            impoverishment. The requester\u0092s state that on December 2012\n            a retroactive resettlement action plan was completed and\n            provided minimal financial assistance to 124 project\n            affected persons displaced during the March 2012 forced\n            eviction, the sums were insufficient to offset the harms\n            suffered, especially in light or the delay of nearly nine\n            months. They add that since February 23, 2013, no relief or\n            emergency aid measures have been undertaken to mitigate the\n            extreme suffering of thousands of affected persons. On\n            October 31, 2013, and in line with the new pilot approach,\n            Bank Management provided to the Panel a written note of\n            actions given by Bank Management to address the concerns of\n            the requesters, including an anticipated timeline as\n            follows: a copy of the 2012 resettlement action plan (RAP)\n            after the demolition or forced eviction in March 2012; a\n            copy of the most recent revision of the 2013 RAP (or\n            addendum to the 2012 RAP as was originally indicated), along\n            with related documents; and clarification about the\n            timetable for the setting up of the grievance mechanism with\n            reference to certain deadlines identified in the Management\n            actions. The Panel has decided to postpone its decision on\n            registration to provide an opportunity for an early\n            resolution of the concerns of the requesters under the\n            pilot. In accordance with the steps set out in the pilot\n            approach, the Panel will ask the requesters and management\n            to engage in dialogue directly on these matters, and to keep\n            it updated on progress in addressing the concerns of the\n            requesters. Also, in line with the pilot approach, the\n            requesters have the right at any time to indicate that they\n            are not satisfied and will like the Panel to register their Request."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Lagos Metropolitan Development and\n            Governance Project : request for inspection"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Lagos Metropolitan\n            Development and Governance Project : request for inspection"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/11/18509971/nigeria-lagos-metropolitan-development-governance-project-request-inspection","projn":"NG-Lagos Metropolitan Development And\n            Governance Project -- P071340","docty":"Inspection Panel Notice of Registration","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Corporate Law,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Social Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20131114114620"},"theme":"Municipal governance and institution building,Urban services and housing for the poor,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Other accountability/anti-corruption","subsc":"Flood protection,Sub-national government administration,Solid waste management,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Social Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets, Bank Management, civil society,\n            civil society organization, communities, compensation,\n            compensation payments, complaints, displaced persons,\n            displacement, employment, eviction, Government officials,\n            homes, housing, impoverishment, individuals, Involuntary\n            Resettlement, mitigation, Operational Policies, persons,\n            procurement, Project Affected Persons, RAP, Remedies,\n            resettlement, resettlement policies, Resettlement Policy,\n            resettlement programs, slum, slums, Specific Investment,\n            State Government, urban policy, urban services"}},"owner":"Urban Dev. & Services Prac 2 (AFTU2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF040164-NIGERIA:LAGOS PILOT URBAN\n            UPGRADING PROJECT - EVALUATION,TF051122-PHRD-NIGERIA : LAGOS\n            METROPOLITAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","majtheme":"Urban development,Public sector governance","repnb":"82626"},"18990252":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/11/18990252/nigeria-lagos-metropolitan-development-governance-project-resettlement-plan-vol-5-5-resettlement-action-plan-displaced-persons-badia-east","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/11/18990252/nigeria-lagos-metropolitan-development-governance-project-resettlement-plan-vol-5-5-resettlement-action-plan-displaced-persons-badia-east","new_url":"2013/11/18990252/nigeria-lagos-metropolitan-development-governance-project-resettlement-plan-vol-5-5-resettlement-action-plan-displaced-persons-badia-east","disclosure_date":"2014-02-10T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2014-02-10T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2014-02-10T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/02/17/000333037_20140217122455/Rendered/INDEX/RP3420V50AFR0R00Box382149B00PUBLIC0.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/02/17/000333037_20140217122455/Rendered/PDF/RP3420V50AFR0R00Box382149B00PUBLIC0.pdf","credit_no":"Q462","datestored":"2014-02-17T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2013-11-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"5","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"5","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Lagos Metropolitan Development\n            and Governance Project : resettlement plan"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Lagos Metropolitan Development\n            Project in Nigeria is a major investment in basic\n            infrastructure towards improving the quality of life of\n            Lagos State inhabitants, in particular, people living in\n            slums.

Any household identified as owning structures\n            affected by the project is eligible for resettlement and\n            compensation packages.
