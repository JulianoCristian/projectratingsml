Some lessons learned included: school grants\n            can be an effective way of addressing problems of access and\n            quality. Non-staff inputs acquired by schools under the\n            Primary School Improvement Program, and the provision of\n            personal needs such as school uniforms for disadvantaged\n            students by school grants played an important role in\n            improving the internal efficiency of primary schools by\n            reducing dropout and repetition rates. However, this depends\n            on school-level capacity (the SMC and head teacher).\n            Measures to ensure timeliness of receipt of funds by schools\n            would enhance the impact of school grants. Pooled funding\n            mechanisms are useful for encouraging a more holistic and\n            effective approach to addressing sector challenges. The\n            pooled fund account should be set up in such a way that can\n            facilitate auditing. In this case, auditing was made\n            difficult by using a system that was not activity based, and\n            this made auditing difficult. The timeframe of three years\n            for the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) funding is\n            too short to facilitate full implementation of activities or\n            even make an impact on the outcome indicators. The GPE\n            funding had to be extended twice to allow for completion of\n            the project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Project to Improve Education
