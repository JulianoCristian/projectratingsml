Some lessons learned includes: the Adaptable\n            program Loan (APL) instrument cut down on the demand for\n            rigorous project preparations for every Specific Investment\n            Loan (SIL). Institutional reform conducted parallel to\n            project implementation causes delays in program\n            implementation. An important lesson learned is that\n            establishment of new institutions require longer time than\n            anticipated for transition, which may impact on project\n            progress, and needs policy consultations and commitment as\n            part of the preparatory work. Restructuring an agency at the\n            same time as implementing a project is challenging and may\n            cause project implementation delays. Cost of the civil works\n            component both at appraisal and feasibility/detailed design\n            varied substantially due to the sudden sharp rise of the\n            cost of fuel, construction materials and other inputs at the\n            time of bidding. Cost of the civil works component at the\n            time of bidding varied substantially from that at the\n            feasibility and detailed design stage due to delays in the\n            procurement process of about four years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Third Phase of the Road Development\n            Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Third Phase of the

the Third Phase of the\n            Road Development Program Project for Uganda is to improve\n            access to rural areas and economically productive areas and\n            to progressively continue to build up sustainable road\n            sector planning, design and program management capability\n            including road safety management. The changes are as\n            follows: (i) dropping several sub-components such as civil\n            works for upgrading of about 23 km of Zirobwe-Wobulenzi\n            road; rehabilitation and re-gravelling of about 91 km of\n            Atiak-Moyo road; and reconstruction and upgrading of about\n            57 km on Busega-Mityana road that could not be implemented\n            due to a shortfall resulting from higher than anticipated\n            bids received on three tendered works contracts, out of the\n            seven originally planned for implementation under the\n            credit; (ii) re-allocating the amounts in category 1 (b) for\n            reconstruction and upgrading of Busega-Mityana road of SDR\n            16.53 million to category 1 (a) to meet the shortfall on\n            upgrading Soroti-Lira road (125 km) and\n            Kampala-Gayza-Zirobwe road (44 km); due to the above and due\n            to the fact that the financing agreement was amended (April\n            25, 2007) to allow 100 percent IDA financing of civil works\n            and consultancy services under the project resulting in cost\n            increases; and (iii) extending the closing date by 22 months\n            from December 31, 2009 to October 30, 2011. Due to initial\n            procurement delays, the last of three contracts for\n            upgrading of Dokolo-Lira road contract will end on November\n            30, 2011. Thus, the extension will allow for completion of\n            the contract and defects liability period and implementation\n            of the Technical Assistance (TA) support to the Ministry of\n            Works and Transport (MoWT) and Uganda National Roads\n            Authority (UNRA). The changes and reallocation will help\n            finance the deficit on the on-going contracts, caused by\n            higher bid prices than originally envisaged at appraisal,\n            resulting from increases in the costs of construction inputs\n            in both local and international markets. The changes will\n            also take into account the initial delays in the procurement\n            of works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Third Phase of the Road Development\n            Program

Road\n            Development Program for Uganda is to improve access to rural\n            areas and economically productive areas, and to\n            progressively continue to build up sustainable road sector\n            planning, design and program management capability including\n            road safety management. The project has the following six\n            components: (1) There is a major cotton processing facility\n            in Lira and the prospect of rehabilitating the factory would\n            increase substantially  the cotton production. Upgrading the\n            road would also extend the paved road network to the North,\n            providing for significant improvements to road transport\n            services between Kampala and the North and between the\n            North, the border regions of Malaba and Busia, and on to the\n            East African seaboard. (2) The facilities of the Ministry of\n            Works, Housing and Communication (MOWHC) date largely from\n            the colonial era. It is proposed to build the Headquarters\n            on MOWHC land near the Central Mechanical Workshop in\n            Kampala. (3) The road construction covers the estimates\n            costs for the supervision cervices of the construction of\n            project roads. (4) Consultants services are being undertaken\n            under Road Sector Institutional Support Technical Assistance\n            Project (RSISTAP) for the execution of full feasibility\n            studies on the upgrading to National Road Standards of a\n            number of District Road Sections as National Roads. (5)\n            Consultants services will be procured in 2004 with the\n            feasibility studies being completed in 2005.
