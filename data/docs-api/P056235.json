The project was\n            successful in the establishment of a medium-term framework\n            for structural reform in financial, corporate, and social\n            sectors; and, played a part in Korea's total rescue\n            package. Both the Bank and the Borrower's performances\n            were satisfactory, in light of substantial advances in the\n            reform program, and, accomplishments in policy commitments.\n            The key lessons include: 1) Loan preparation under time\n            constraints is conducive to oversights which may delay the\n            final analysis. These constraints led to pressures during\n            negotiations, causing inefficient delays in loan\n            effectiveness. 2) Initiating policy discussions with top\n            policy makers, is advisable, particularly, under adjustment\n            operations, for, they are who will actually make the\n            decision or commitment on required reform policies. Early\n            discussions with technical staff, led to policy discussions\n            which could not advance. 3) The Bank and the Fund under\n            simultaneous negotiations in policy areas, should present a\n            consistent unified front, for, inconsistencies, can play one\n            institution against the other, as the Bank, under time\n            pressure, accepted non-commital external audit reforms. 4)\n            While single tranche instruments are better suited for a\n            volatile environment, double tranche, offers longer\n            enactment for reforms, and, are administratively less expensive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Structural Adjustment Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Structural Adjustment

It\n            builds on the work initiated under the Economic\n            Reconstruction Loan, approved on December 23, 1997. The\n            project will help Korea deal with the immediate foreign\n            exchange crisis as well as support a major program of\n            structural reforms in the financial and real sectors to lay\n            the basis for Korea's eventual return to strong and\n            sustained growth. The structural reform program spans four\n            important areas: a) financial sector restructuring and\n            development; b) corporate sector reform, including reform of\n            corporate governance and competition policies; c) labor\n            market reform and the strengthening of social safety nets;\n            and d) institutional reform in economic policy management.\n            There are some risks to the program. A key risk derives from\n            Korea's still fragile macroeconomic situation, and its\n            continued vulnerability to shifts in investor confidence. To\n            mitigate this risk, the Bank will work closely with the IMF\n            (International Monetary Fund), ADB (Asian Development Bank),\n            and other partners. Another risk arises from the weakness of\n            the domestic banking system. This project will expedite the\n            process of financial sector restructuring and corporate debt\n            workouts. There is also a risk that the economic downturn\n            may be more severe than currently expected, which will be\n            mitigated by the strong safety net measures. The loan will\n            be disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Structural
