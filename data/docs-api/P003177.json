The proposed line of credit would carry the following\n            terms and conditions: (a) Onlending rate and exchange risk:\n            DBZ would onlend at a minimum rate of 12 percent and review\n            its interest structure annually with a view towards\n            maintaining real positive interest rates; (b) Free limit:\n            the free limit under the first line of credit to DBZ was\n            US$250,000 (aggregate US$3 million). In recognition of the\n            quality of DBZ' appraisals, the free limit will be\n            raised to US$400,000 and the aggregate to US$5 million. This\n            will still permit the Bank to review about 60 percent of\n            projects financed by the Bank loan, which is considered\n            adequate; (c) Amortization schedule: the proposed loan to\n            DBZ would have a flexible amortization schedule conforming\n            to the aggregate amortization schedule of DBZ sub-loans,\n            none of which should, in principle, exceed 15 years; (d)\n            Commitment fees: as a change from the first IBRD loan for\n            which DBZ had concessionary treatment, standard commitment\n            fees would be charged on the US$15 million Bank loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Second Development Bank Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - Second Development Bank Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/10/726154/zambia-second-development-bank-project","projn":"ZM-Dfc Ii-267849 -- P003177","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Zambia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912520448"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,arable land,Auditors,autonomy,bad\n            debts,Balance Sheets,bank deposits,capital goods,Cash Flow\n            Statements,Central Bank,cities,coal,commercial bank\n            deposits,commercial banks,controlled prices,credit\n            policies,debt,deposits,development projects,discount\n            rate,disposable income,dividends,economic\n            conditions,EIB,employment,Equity\n            Investments,expenditures,exploitation,exports,farms,financial\n            assets,Financial Institutions,Financial Ratios,Financial\n            Sector,FISCAL YEAR,fish,forecasts,Foreign\n            Exchange,GDP,GNP,Government subsidies,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Income Statements,income\n            taxes,industrialization,Inflation,Insurance,Interest\n            Rate,Interest Rates,intermediate goods,international\n            reserves,labor force,lending rates,liquidation,loan\n            financing,migration,Mines,net assets,Net Worth,oil,operating\n            costs,population growth,price setting,pricing\n            policies,private banks,profit margins,reserve\n            requirements,Retained\n            Earnings,Savings,subsidiaries,subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,transport,urbanization,value added,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,arable land,Auditors,autonomy,bad\n            debts,Balance Sheets,bank deposits,capital goods,Cash Flow\n            Statements,Central Bank,cities,coal,commercial bank\n            deposits,commercial banks,controlled prices,credit\n            policies,debt,deposits,development projects,discount\n            rate,disposable income,dividends,economic\n            conditions,EIB,employment,Equity\n            Investments,expenditures,exploitation,exports,farms,financial\n            assets,Financial Institutions,Financial Ratios,Financial\n            Sector,FISCAL YEAR,fish,forecasts,Foreign\n            Exchange,GDP,GNP,Government subsidies,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Income Statements,income\n            taxes,industrialization,Inflation,Insurance,Interest\n            Rate,Interest Rates,intermediate goods,international\n            reserves,labor force,lending rates,liquidation,loan\n            financing,migration,Mines,net assets,Net Worth,oil,operating\n            costs,population growth,price setting,pricing\n            policies,private banks,profit margins,reserve\n            requirements,Retained\n            Earnings,Savings,subsidiaries,subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,transport,urbanization,value added,working capital"}},"owner":"WB Off:Maputo - Southern AFR 2 (AFCS2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"3202"},"facets":{}}}
