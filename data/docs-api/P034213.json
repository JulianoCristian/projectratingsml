Some lessons\n            learned included: (1) given the large attitudinal shift\n            involved in the agricultural transition, government\n            officials and project staff need substantial technical\n            assistance and training before operations can be expected to\n            succeed; (2) in the complex and rapidly changing ECA\n            environment, sound donor coordination was critical; (3) with\n            respect to agriculture and agribusiness services, project\n            experience demonstrated that farmers and rural business\n            owners will respond enthusiastically to innovative\n            technologies corresponding to their needs; (4) on land\n            administration, the Bank\u0092s international experience\n            strengthened the design of projects in ECA, and these\n            projects showed the importance of avoiding a\n            'one-size-fits- all' approach and the sound payoff\n            to adopting a unified approach to develop property registry\n            and cadaster; and (5) the rural finance operations showed\n            that with appropriate regulation, technical advice and staff\n            training banks that lend to rural areas can operate\n            sustainably; also, non-bank financial intermediaries have an\n            important role to play in rural areas; but it is
