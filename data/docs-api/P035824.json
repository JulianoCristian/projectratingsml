The lessons learned indicate that changing\n            policies, processes, institutions and people's\n            incentives and attitudes is a pre-requisite for agricultural\n            transformation. Commercialization and private sector\n            involvement is necessary for raising rural incomes.\n            Stability in Project Coordinator and other senior staff,\n            together with appropriate decision making authority and\n            accountability, contributes significantly towards success.\n            Administrative and financial decentralization need to occur\n            together to be effective. Use of beneficiary groups as entry\n            points for project activities improves participation and\n            beneficiaries' capacity to absorb project-supported\n            changes. Input and service supply based on full-cost\n            recovery is feasible provided quality and timeliness are\n            assured. Early and adequate training in financial management\n            for project staff, including concerned staff of implementing\n            agencies/departments, is essential in view of the time\n            required to absorb and apply these skills. Use of an\n            independent agency for M&E improves quality and\n            timeliness of reporting, contributing significantly to\n            user-feedback and effective project monitoring and management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Diversified Agricultural Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Diversified Agricultural\n            Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/09/5143125/india-diversified-agricultural-support-project","projn":"IN-Diversified Agricultural Support Project\n            (Dasp) -- P035824","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,ICT Policy and Strategies,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040923094638"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development, Agricultural\n            extension, agricultural information, agricultural\n            information systems, Agricultural marketing, agricultural\n            policies, agricultural production, agricultural production\n            systems, agricultural productivity, Agricultural Research,\n            Agricultural Technology, agricultural technology\n            dissemination, Agricultural Universities, Agriculture,\n            animal health, animal husbandry, Artificial Insemination,\n            Audits, banks, Biodiversity, breeding, capacity building,\n            cattle, cereals, chemical fertilizers, clinics, commodities,\n            community participation, Conservation, cropping, crops,\n            decentralization, decision making, development projects,\n            economic analysis, economic status, environmental benefits,\n            expenditures, Extension, farmers, farming, farming systems,\n            feed, fertilizers, Financial analysis, Financial Management,\n            first aid, food processing, food security, fruits,\n            horticultural crops, households, Impact assessment, incomes,\n            Infrastructure services, Integrated Pest Management,\n            integration, Lands, Lessons Learned, livestock, Maize,\n            mortality, negative effects, new technologies, NGOs,\n            Nutrition, participatory approaches, Partnership, pesticide\n            residues, pesticides, Policy Analysis, poverty reduction,\n            private sector, procurement, project implementation, Project\n            Preparation, public expenditure, public sector, quality\n            control, rehabilitation/, rice, rural communities, Rural\n            Development, rural infrastructure, rural roads, sericulture,\n            silk, soil fertility, South Asia, suppliers, Universities,\n            vaccination, vegetables, waste, waste management, Watershed,\n            weight, wheat"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022513-NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL\n            TECHNOLOGY PROJECT,TF022584-PHRD-UTTAR PRADESH\n            DIVERS.AGRIC.

The first, support for\n            technology development, enhances capacity for research\n            coordination; establishes a competitive agricultural\n            research program (CARP) to support time bound adaptive\n            research on priority constraints, increases productivity of\n            the smallholder agriculture; and strengthens research\n            support for technology dissemination activities. The second\n            establishes a demand-driven technology dissemination system\n            through rationalizing, reorienting, and strengthening line\n            departments; increases participation by the private sector\n            in input supply and support services; increases\n            participation by the farming communities mobilized with the\n            help of nongovernmental organizations; and supports human\n            resource development and greater use of information\n            technology. The third supports increased private sector\n            involvement and public/private partnerships in agri-business\n            development. The fourth supports rural infrastructure\n            development by improving rural roads in the project\n            districts, rural markets, and market information collection\n            and dissemination systems.
