Lessons learned include: the\n            Casamance experience confirms that while a demobilization\n            and reintegration program is important it needs to be\n            complemented with broader development and social\n            mobilization efforts that can sustain peace. Building trust,\n            rebuilding social capital, and finding areas of common\n            ground between all stakeholders in parallel with formal\n            negotiations are key to achieving sustainable results in\n            fragile conditions. Project implementation shows that in\n            post conflict situations it is essential to first identify\n            and then address the causes of conflict. Before the Mid-term\n            Review (MTR) restructuring, it became clear that the peace\n            benefits from infrastructure rehabilitation were significant\n            despite the interruption in the negotiations and further\n            postponement of demobilization. It is clear from the\n            experience of the project that peace cannot be achieved\n            through negotiations alone, but requires a minimal\n            functional basic socio economic infrastructure. The project\n            unit in Ziguinchor realized that it had to obtain agreements\n            from all stakeholders, as well as from local MFDC (Mouvement\n            des Forces Democratiques de la Casamance - rebellion\n            movement in Casamance) representatives, on which\n            infrastructure to rehabilitate. The implementation unit in\n            Ziguinchor was only able to attract staff from the region\n            when it was established. Staff from other parts of Senegal\n            was not inclined to come and or bring their families in view\n            of the uncertain security situation prevailing at the start\n            of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Casamance Emergency\n            Reconstruction

Reconstruction\n            Support Project aims to support the Government of Senegal\n            in: (a) facilitating a speedy restoration in Casamance of a\n            productive economic and social environment similar to that\n            existing in the rest of Senegal; and (b) laying the\n            groundwork for sustainable long-term development in the\n            region, while fully respecting its specificities. To achieve\n            its objectives, the project will have three components: (1)\n            demobilization and reinsertion of combatants and other\n            conflict victims; (2) infrastructure reconstruction and\n            rehabilitation; and (3) technical support for the\n            preparation o f a long-term development program. The\n            projects support for long-term development program\n            preparation and cross-cutting issues including monitoring\n            and evaluation, conflict warning and prevention, social\n            mobilization, social and environmental activities, project\n            management. This component aimed at funding studies\n            (hydraulics, land tenure, transport, tourism, private sector\n            development, environmental and natural resources), and\n            salaries, equipment, and capacity building of the project\n            coordinating unit. The project improve key infrastructure in\n            education, health, transport, including the electrification\n            of rural medical centers. The project increase school gross\n            enrollment rate to the level it was before the conflict (93\n            percent) and increases the use of health facilities by 40\n            percent. Number of communities connected to the core road\n            network (all-weather roads). The project results will allow\n            gauging the effectiveness of the advocacy strategy in the\n            peace process and the subsequent effective demobilization of\n            rebels. Gauge the effectiveness of the strategy to improve\n            not only the access to better social services, but also to\n            promote the peace process as a whole."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -

To achieve\n            its objectives, the project will have three components: (1)\n            demobilization and reinsertion of combatants and other\n            conflict victims; (2) infrastructure reconstruction and\n            rehabilitation; and (3) technical support for the\n            preparation o f a long-term development program. In\n            addition, the National Agency for the Recovery o f Social\n            and Economic Activities in Casamance (ANRAC) will directly\n            implement other cross-cutting activities, such as\n            instituting a management information system. The project\n            will benefit Senegal as a whole and the Casamance region in\n            particular. All ex-combatants and their families will be\n            offered opportunities to resume normal civilian lives with\n            appropriate economic activities. Approximately 30,000\n            displaced persons will be supported in their return to\n            normal life in their original homes. After project\n            completion, Casamance is expected to be an exporter of\n            agricultural products abroad and a supplier to the local\n            Senegalese market. Significant foreign direct investment in\n            the tourism sector should also occur once regional stability\n            is secured. External risks to the project include: 1. A\n            full-scale rebellion because of disagreements between the\n            Rebellion Movement in Casamance (MFDC) and the Government;\n            and repeated attacks staged by gangs of former combatants.\n            Project risks comprise the following: 1) Poor coordination\n            among the various efforts taking place in Casamance; 2) Lack\n            of collaboration/trust between the administration and the\n            beneficiaries.; 3) Slowness of implementation and\n            disbursement; and 4) Inability of displaced persons to\n            return to their original homes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Casamance Emergency Reconstruction\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Casamance Emergency\n

biodiversity and in\n            marine resources, and presents a regional analysis of the\n            degradation of these natural resources. The analysis further\n            demonstrates the detrimental impact of currently ongoing,\n            resource degradation and its socioeconomic consequence; and\n            identifies all pertinent positive and negative impacts\n            expected of program interventions. Project interventions\n            comprise demining, demobilization, community development,\n            and reconstruction. Of the four, the component supporting\n            reconstruction and rehabilitation of non-community\n            infrastructures may have major negative impacts-although\n            this component could have a distinct positive impact when\n            correcting existing infrastructure problems. General risks\n            concern the overexploitation of forest resources; accidents\n            connected with demining; conflicts over land use, especially\n            between farmers and herders, and newcomers and residents;\n            social and political discrimination; the spread of sexually\n            transmitted diseases-particularly HIV/AIDS; disappearing\n            species and the loss of habitats; flooded lands;\n            agro-chemical pollution of water and soil from pesticides;\n            soil salinity, sedimentation, and erosion; increase of\n            water-borne illnesses; air pollution caused by dust from\n            solid and liquid waste disposal; transformation and\n            destruction of coastal areas and mangrove areas because of\n            shrimp production;  Mitigation measures will include\n            rehabilitating degraded natural habitats; construction and\n            rehabilitation of anti-salinity dikes; involving the\n            population in improving land management; and institutional\n            measures that improve knowledge of biodiversity and\n            environmental management, evaluate natural resources,\n            regulate their uses, and put in place measures for their\n            conservation; and training, information, and awareness\n            building measures. Also recommended is supplementary project\n            financing from the GEF Operational Program on sustainable\n            land management in order to further improve the land\n            resource base of the Casamance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republique de Senegal - Programme de relance\n            des activites economiques et socials en Casamance"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \u2013 Programme de relance\n            des activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques et sociales en Casamance :\n            \u00e9valuation environnementale : R\u00e9publique de S\u00e9n\u00e9gal\u00a0-\n            Programme de relance des activit\u00e9s \u00e9conomiques et sociales\n            en Casamance"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/5036902/senegal--casamance-emergency-reconstruction-support-project-environmental-assessment-republique-de-senegal-programme-de-relance-des-activites-economiques-socials-en-casamance","projn":"SN-Casamance Emergency Reconstruction\n            Support Project - Cersp -- P069207","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Senegal","authors":{"authr":"Buursink, Dakar"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040813154920"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Roads and highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Forest resource depletion; Demining;\n            Demobilization & reintegration programs; Reconstruction;\n            Infrastructure rehabilitation; Land use management; Land use\n            restrictions; Discriminatory treatment; Conflict management;\n            Sexually transmitted diseases; HIV/AIDS; Habitat\n            conservation; Biodiversity conservation; Flood management;\n            Agrochemicals; Pesticide management; Soil salinity;\n            Sedimentation; Soil erosion control structures; Water-borne\n            diseases; Air pollution control; Dust nuisance; Solid waste\n            disposal; Liquid waste disposal; Coastal environments;\n            Mangrove ecosystems; Shrimp farming; Natural resources\n            management; Environmental awareness; Training programs"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026228-PHRD-CASAMANCE RURAL INVESTMENT PROJECT","repnb":"E1001","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Republique de Senegal - Programme de\n            relance des activites economiques et socials en Casamance"}}},"5059628":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/06/5059628/senegal-casamance-emergency-reconstruction-support-project-resettlement-framework-programme-de-relance-des-activites-economiques-sociales-en-casamance-cadre-de-politique-de-reinstallation","available_in":"French","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/06/5059628/senegal-casamance-emergency-reconstruction-support-project-resettlement-framework-programme-de-relance-des-activites-economiques-sociales-en-casamance-cadre-de-politique-de-reinstallation","new_url":"2004/06/5059628/senegal-casamance-emergency-reconstruction-support-project-resettlement-framework-programme-de-relance-des-activites-economiques-sociales-en-casamance-cadre-de-politique-de-reinstallation","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/08/24/000160016_20040824112133/Rendered/INDEX/rp25910Sen0Cas1ique0de0RTinstallat1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/08/24/000160016_20040824112133/Rendered/PDF/rp25910Sen0Cas1ique0de0RTinstallat1.pdf","credit_no":"Q426","datestored":"2004-08-24T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-06-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Casamance Emergency\n            Reconstruction Support Project : resettlement framework"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This resettlement framework discusses\n            the criteria and the means to be used in assessing losses to\n            project affected persons and compensating them equitably in\n            a transparent procedure.
