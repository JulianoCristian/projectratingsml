Some lessons learned includes: financial\n            sector reforms are relatively easy to design but difficult\n            to implement. Successful implementation depends on two\n            crucial factors: the commitment of the authorities to the\n            reform program; and the effectiveness of project\n            supervision. The Egyptian authorities have shown a strong\n            commitment to the multi-year reform program that was\n            designed by the reformist government that was appointed in\n            2004. The reform program did not include the privatization\n            of the two largest commercial banks nor the large insurance\n            companies. However, many measures were taken to improve the\n            management of these institutions, which one commentator\n            resembled to an effective 'privatization of\n            management' rather than 'privatization of\n            ownership'. A dogmatic approach to the ownership\n            question would not be justified, especially after the public\n            rescue of so many leading private banks and insurance\n            companies in high-income countries during the 2008 global\n            financial crisis. Policy based operations may require strong\n            Bank technical assistance efforts as part of the process,\n            particularly in the financial sector. Multi-trenched\n            financial sector adjustment operations are effective\n            instruments to support major financial sector reforms.\n            Achievements under the operations three policy areas thus\n            contributed substantially to the overall development outcome\n            sought by the operation: strengthen the enabling legal and\n            institutional environment for financial intermediation and\n            risk management and to increase the role and participation\n            of the private sector in the provision of financial\n            services. The most relevant lesson of this project is\n            perhaps the importance of the ownership of the reform\n            program by the authorities and their strong commitment to\n            its success. This is underscored by the second component of\n            the operation concerning the restructuring of the ailing\n            specialized public financial institutions. The key lesson\n            from these two projects was the importance of the commitment\n            of the authorities to the reform program, which was most\n            evident prior to and during the project. Without this strong\n            and effective commitment, such significant results could not\n            have been achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt, Morocco and Guatemala - First and\n

Some lessons learned included: an efficient\n            cooperation between the project team and the country office\n            team can lower the operational cost of a project.

The\n            project will support these objectives under three components\n            aimed at: 1) implementing an effective and modern legal,\n            regulatory and supervisory framework, in line with\n            international standards, across the banking, insurance, and\n            securities markets, so as to improve financial\n            intermediation and risk-taking behaviors, and, foster a more\n            efficient mobilization of savings; 2) restructuring weak\n            public financial institutions, particularly in addressing\n            their stock of non-performing assets, and streamlining their\n            role and activities in the financial sector; and, 3)\n            developing as needed the financial sector infrastructure in\n            modernizing the payments system, improving the integrity of\n            the financial sector through better anti-money laundering\n            policies, and, enhancing the quality of financial\n            information in upgrading accounting and auditing standards.\n            However, main risks could include a slowdown of the reform\n            momentum, to a path that would not allow for a genuine move\n            towards market-based, risk-taking business patterns in the\n            specialized public banking institutions (moral hazard\n            issue). This is of particular concern to the restructuring\n            of the Credit Agricole du Maroc, the pace of this\n            restructuring, and, the burden-sharing of costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Financial Sector Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Financial Sector\n            Development
