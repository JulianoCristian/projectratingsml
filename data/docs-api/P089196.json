Some lessons learned\n            included: the higher risk can sometimes produce higher\n            return; the success of customs automation has led to\n            systemic and institutional changes in the way customs\n            clearance is operated. IT may be a good tool for\n            institutional and structural changes. It can bring about a\n            more transparent and predictable way of conducting\n            transactions which can lead to growth of trade and of the\n            economy. The crucially important factor in this success was\n            the strong ground team, with close and frequent exchanges\n            with the client. The Bank may not want to implement the same\n            type of project in a country where there isn't such a\n            strong field presence. This kind of customs\n            automation/modernization project serves and supports the\n            backbone of the private sector, and Cambodia's national\n            poverty reduction strategy emphases that the private sector\n            is the engine of economic growth. The project responded well\n            to that. It may be useful for other LDCs to learn from that\n            approach. Another lesson was learned when stakeholders in\n            this project accused the Bank of excessive rigidity in its\n            management of procurement, resulting several times in the\n            rejection of all bids. In such cases rebidding delayed\n            implementation by 6-12 months, which has been costly to the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Trade Facilitation and\n            Competitiveness

Trade Facilitation\n            and Competitiveness Project (TFCP) for Cambodia is to\n            promote economic growth by reducing transaction costs\n            associated with trade and investment, introducing\n            transparency in investment processes, and facilitating\n            access of enterprises to export markets. The restructuring\n            will mainly reallocate resources from the subcomponent on\n            the electronic single window to: (i) a further extension of\n            the customs automated system; (ii) automation of\n            Certificates of Origin (C/O) issuance; and (iii) creation of\n            a Trade Information Website (TIW). Early during project\n            implementation, the Government indicated its decision not to\n            proceed with the institutional model initially envisaged for\n            the creation of a single window. However, it remained\n            committed to offering much of the functionality initially\n            envisaged under such a single window, building on the\n            platform of the customs automated system supported by the\n            TFCP. The restructuring supports this new approach through\n            redeploying resources that will support further deployment\n            of the customs automated system, the automation of C/O, and\n            the dissemination of trade-related information on a new TIW.\n            Other resources are being redeployed to continue support to\n            trade-related labor standards in the garment industries\n            ('better factories Cambodia') and additional training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -
