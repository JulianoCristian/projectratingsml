For both projects, the project outcome is rated\n            highly satisfactory. Institutional development is rated\n            substantial, and project sustainability is likely. World\n            Bank performance is rated satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance is rated highly satisfactory. A number of\n            lessons were confirmed by these experiences. Although\n            oft-repeated, it remains a truism that government commitment\n            is critical for success. Projects often have components\n            involving multiple ministries, but these can be successfully\n            implemented when there is a strong stakeholder commitment to\n            reform and when there is political and administrative\n            commitment to setting and achieving high-quality standards.\n            Second, beside academic qualifications, criteria for\n            awarding fellowships should include work experience and\n            activities indicating leadership ability. Third, while using\n            well-trained and dedicated teachers as supervisors may\n            significantly promote high achievement, it takes them out of\n            the classroom and may undermine the purpose. Fourth,\n            suitable incentives are needed to create a pool of qualified\n            and effective teachers. Fifth, fellowship programs need\n            components of cost recovery, clear prioritizing of local\n            needs, and clear selection criteria to raise the\n            population's confidence level regarding the\n            impartiality of selections made. Sixth, training abroad may\n            be more economical and efficient."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - The First and Second Education\n            and Training

This\n            project demonstrates that projects in small countries with\n            limited resources can be successfully implemented where\n            there is strong stakeholder commitment to reform, and where\n            there is political and administrative commitment to setting\n            and achieving high quality standards. In this instance the\n            level of parental commitment to education manifested itself\n            in the much larger than expected enrollment in the new\n            junior secondary institutions, and in post-secondary\n            courses, and improving equitable access to school. For\n            effective project implementation, an efficient and\n            autonomous Project Implementation Unit (PIU) is a necessary\n            condition. Investment in developing PIU capacity can have\n            wider benefit to contribute to an increase in public sector\n            management efficiency. The fellowship scheme has proved\n            successful in developing much-needed expertise and\n            knowledge. Fellowship placements should commerce early\n            during project implementation to allow for completion of\n            studies within the project period. Cost-recovery mechanisms\n            should be implemented as soon as beneficiaries return from\n            overseas study. Community commitment to education can have a\n            strong positive impact. Improving the internal efficiency of\n            an education system by increasing student-teacher ratios\n            requires strong government commitment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - Second Education and Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Maldives - Second Education and\n            Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/04/1346267/maldives-second-education-training-project","projn":"MV-Education -- P004337","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Girls Education","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Maldives","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01060804031587"},"subsc":"Vocational training,Central government administration,Secondary education,Primary education,Tertiary education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"academic\n            staff,Achievement,achievements,addition,age\n            cohort,classrooms,computer\n            skills,curricula,curriculum,development\n            program,developmental impact,diplomas,distance\n            education,education facilities,education materials,education\n            officials,education quality,Education Sector,Education\n            Statistics,education system,educational\n            indicators,educational institutions,educational\n            materials,educational policy,educational\n            quality,enrollment,equitable access,Female students,female\n            teachers,GER,Girls,Girls enrollment,Gross Enrolment\n            Ratio,Institutional\n            Development,instructors,interventions,labor force,labor\n            market,leadership,medium of instruction,positive\n            impact,pre-service teacher training,Primary\n            Education,primary enrollment,primary school,primary school\n            teachers,primary teachers,principals,printing,professional\n            development,Quality Assurance,scholarships,school\n            facilities,school structure,schooling,schools,secondary\n            education,secondary enrollment,secondary level,secondary\n            school leavers,secondary school teachers,secondary\n            schools,Secondary Teacher Education,significant\n            impact,skills training,staff development,stipends,student\n            enrollment,Student Teacher Ratio,student teachers,subject\n            areas,Teacher,Teacher Education,teacher education\n            programs,teacher educators,teacher quality,teacher\n            trainers,teacher training,teachers,teaching,teaching\n            profession,Tertiary education,training\n            programs,universities,untrained teachers,Vocational Training"},"1":{"cdata!":"academic\n            staff,Achievement,achievements,addition,age\n            cohort,classrooms,computer\n            skills,curricula,curriculum,development\n            program,developmental impact,diplomas,distance\n            education,education facilities,education materials,education\n            officials,education quality,Education Sector,Education\n            Statistics,education system,educational\n            indicators,educational institutions,educational\n            materials,educational policy,educational\n            quality,enrollment,equitable access,Female students,female\n            teachers,GER,Girls,Girls enrollment,Gross Enrolment\n            Ratio,Institutional\n            Development,instructors,interventions,labor force,labor\n            market,leadership,medium of instruction,positive\n            impact,pre-service teacher training,Primary\n            Education,primary enrollment,primary school,primary school\n            teachers,primary teachers,principals,printing,professional\n            development,Quality Assurance,scholarships,school\n            facilities,school structure,schooling,schools,secondary\n            education,secondary enrollment,secondary level,secondary\n            school leavers,secondary school teachers,secondary\n            schools,Secondary Teacher Education,significant\n            impact,skills training,staff development,stipends,student\n            enrollment,Student Teacher Ratio,student teachers,subject\n            areas,Teacher,Teacher Education,teacher education\n            programs,teacher educators,teacher quality,teacher\n            trainers,teacher training,teachers,teaching,teaching\n            profession,Tertiary education,training\n            programs,universities,untrained teachers,Vocational Training"}},"owner":"S.A.
