Ratings for the\n            Third Programmatic Development Policy Grant Operation\n            Project for Tajikistan were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: achieving development results is possible if\n            interventions are designed on the basis of a good\n            understanding of Tajikistan's political economy and the\n            Bank is willing to be flexible in identifying the reform\n            program that it will support. Having in place a good\n            monitoring and evaluation framework promotes a better\n            dialogue improves government coordination and helps in\n            monitoring implementation and progress towards expected\n            outcomes. A mix of development policy lending and investment\n            operations can be effective in supporting development\n            outcomes in post-conflict and fragile states. However, the\n            desire to improve overall portfolio performance carries the\n            risk of overloading the policy-based finance agenda.\n            Providing support for implementation of the reform agenda is\n            essential to success in environments of low capacity. Basing\n            the reform program on a strong foundation of analytical work\n            and piloting innovative approaches can help stakeholders\n            better understand what will work in the specific\n            circumstances of Tajikistan. Substantial progress has made\n            with development partner coordination, with the Bank\n            regularly consulting with other development partners on a\n            wide variety of issues. This has led to a greater division\n            of labor among partners and reduced and the burden on\n            government of uncoordinated development partner efforts. The\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Asian Development\n            Bank, the European Commission (EC), and the major bilateral\n            donors in Tajikistan were all informed of the status of the\n            implementation of the prior actions and milestones of the\n            PDPG 1-3 series to ensure that all were able to advance the\n            reform

First component is\n            to maintain macroeconomic stability; second component is to\n            improve investment climate through reform of licensing and\n            inspections, increasing transparency of the privatization\n            process and promoting market competition; and third\n            component is to reform regulatory frameworks by separating\n            policy making from regulatory functions in key strategic\n            sectors (aviation, cotton, and energy). Pillar two: improve\n            public sector management and public service delivery.
