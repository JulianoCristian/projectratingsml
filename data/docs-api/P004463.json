It would be implemented primarily by LBP,\n            would benefit about 28,000 rural families, and would\n            include: (i) production and marketing credit mainly for\n            rice, corn and vegetables; (ii) term credit for light farm\n            mechanization, post-harvest facilities, backyard livestock\n            and poultry and cottage industries; (iii) strengthening of\n            LBP's field operations; (iv) minor infrastructural\n            works in selected agrarian reform areas; and (v) studies\n            aimed at better understanding of the socio-economic\n            conditions of small-scale agriculture.

It would be implemented primarily by LBP,\n            would benefit about 28,000 rural families, and would\n            include: (i) production and marketing credit mainly for\n            rice, corn and vegetables; (ii) term credit for light farm\n            mechanization, post-harvest facilities, backyard livestock\n            and poultry and cottage industries; (iii) strengthening of\n            LBP's field operations; (iv) minor infrastructural\n            works in selected agrarian reform areas; and (v) studies\n            aimed at better understanding of the socio-economic\n            conditions of small-scale agriculture. Incremental\n            employment is estimated at 11,900 man-years and additional\n            production of goods and services at $15.4 million at full\n            development, resulting in foreign exchange savings of $8.8\n            million annually. Attainment of higher crop yields, loan\n            repayment, and LBP's limited experience in agricultural\n            credit are the main risk factors. Against these risks,\n            strengthened field level technical assistance and\n            organizational measures adequate to promote higher yields\n            and ensure satisfactory loan collections have been\n            incorporated in the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Small Farmer Development -\n            Land Bank - Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Small Farmer\n            Development - Land Bank - Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/11/726756/philippines-small-farmer-development-land-bank-project","projn":"PH-Small Farmer Devt. -- P004463","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912413584"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abaca,accounting,Agrarian\n            Reform,Agricultural\n            development,Agriculture,animals,bamboo,beef,breeding,by-products,cash\n            crops,Cattle,cattle diseases,coconut,coconuts,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,corn,cost centers,Cottage\n            Industries,cotton,crop,crop losses,cropping,cropping\n            intensity,cultivation,current\n            assets,Debt,deposits,diet,diseases,earning assets,Economic\n            Conditions,effective use,empirical\n            evidence,Employment,Extension,Extension Services,Farm,farm\n            income,farm incomes,Farm Management,farm productivity,farm\n            work,Farmers,farming,farms,feed,financial\n            management,Financial Structure,flood control,food crops,food\n            grains,Foreign Exchange,fruits,grain,grain\n            production,Grains,gross\n            earnings,groundwater,harvests,husbandry,imports,integration,Irrigation,labor\n            force,land reform,lands,liquidity ratio,Livestock,Local\n            Government,market prices,Marketable\n            Securities,MARKETING,multiple\n            cropping,nutrition,paddy,pests,planting,pork,Poultry,poverty\n            line,produce,producers,production costs,rainfed\n            areas,rattan,Return on Assets,rice,rice cultivation,rice\n            production,rural employment,securities,Small Farmer,SMALL\n            FARMERS,small- scale farmers,small-scale\n            farmers,sugar,technical\n            assistance,tillage,tillers,tobacco,vegetables,veterinary\n            services,water use,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"abaca,accounting,Agrarian\n            Reform,Agricultural\n            development,Agriculture,animals,bamboo,beef,breeding,by-products,cash\n            crops,Cattle,cattle diseases,coconut,coconuts,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,corn,cost centers,Cottage\n            Industries,cotton,crop,crop losses,cropping,cropping\n            intensity,cultivation,current\n            assets,Debt,deposits,diet,diseases,earning assets,Economic\n            Conditions,effective use,empirical\n            evidence,Employment,Extension,Extension Services,Farm,farm\n            income,farm incomes,Farm Management,farm productivity,farm\n            work,Farmers,farming,farms,feed,financial\n            management,Financial Structure,flood control,food crops,food\n            grains,Foreign Exchange,fruits,grain,grain\n            production,Grains,gross\n            earnings,groundwater,harvests,husbandry,imports,integration,Irrigation,labor\n            force,land reform,lands,liquidity ratio,Livestock,Local\n            Government,market prices,Marketable\n            Securities,MARKETING,multiple\n            cropping,nutrition,paddy,pests,planting,pork,Poultry,poverty\n            line,produce,producers,production costs,rainfed\n            areas,rattan,Return on Assets,rice,rice cultivation,rice\n            production,rural employment,securities,Small Farmer,SMALL\n            FARMERS,small- scale farmers,small-scale\n            farmers,sugar,technical\n            assistance,tillage,tillers,tobacco,vegetables,veterinary\n            services,water use,yields"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"2189"},"facets":{}}}
