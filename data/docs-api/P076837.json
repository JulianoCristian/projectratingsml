Some lessons\n            learned included: initially set up as a temporary agency,\n            under the NCDP Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF) has\n            continued to innovate with approaches to poverty reduction\n            at the community level and to provide an example of\n            transparency and good governance. As a result, the NCDP\n            experience has shown that a multi-sectoral, poverty-targeted\n            agency can be a well integrated instrument of Government\n            policy. Jamaica did not have a functioning system of\n            participatory community development planning. NCDP correctly\n            identified Social Development Commission (SDC) as the agency\n            having the closest to this mandate, but had little capacity\n            to readily fulfill this role. Community Driven Development\n            (CDD) projects face a quandary in this circumstance and good\n            institutional analysis upfront to determine capacity and\n            responsibilities is essential. Even without this broader\n            community planning, very relevant and sustainable community\n            investments can be made provided there are effective\n            sectoral linkages and good community outreach. Social\n            development objectives, like developing community\n            institutions, building social capital, developing trust in\n            and between communities, and changing longstanding\n            inter-community relationships may take longer and not be a\n            straight path. These broader social objectives should be\n            modest and well-focused in the short-term. And, it is\n            important to find ways of documenting these on-going changes\n            where simple quantitative indicators are insufficient."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - National
