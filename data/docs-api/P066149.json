Some\n            lessons learned included: ownership of the implementing\n            agency remains the single most important factor in\n            determining the success of a project. Clearance and support\n            from central Government agencies are a necessary but not\n            sufficient condition for success. Better understanding and\n            increased awareness of the political economy surrounding a\n            specific program or operation is likely to positively affect\n            its ultimate outcome. From a Government perspective, carving\n            out a relevant role for the Bank in a sophisticated country\n            needs careful discussion of where the Bank's\n            value-added is, and how it can be maximized. Remaining\n            engaged in non-performing operations should be carefully\n            evaluated against longer-term implications.

The educators say,\n            grants are crucial for improving Turkey's education\n            system, and for getting more children into the classroom.\n            Emirdag is several hundred kilometers outside of Ankara. The\n            student enrollment at many schools here was below 90\n            percent. With support from the World Bank, schools in poorer\n            areas, with less than 90 percent enrollment, are eligible\n            for small grants. 10 percent of Turkey's schools\n            receive them. The grants are designed, first and foremost,\n            to raise enrollments. But they also aim to get the community\n            involved in schooling, and they bring decision-making to the\n            local level. The schools decide how to use the money, which\n            runs from 4,000 dollars to nearly 30,000 dollars. Some use\n            the money on buildings. The local health school paid to\n            convert an old hospital into its school building. Some\n            schools invest in new computer centers, which are open to\n            the public after school hours. Some use the money to offer\n            Turkish culture classes, or even to build a basketball\n            court. The basketball court has spawned a competitive\n            girls' team, which is a great source of school pride.\n            But that was only the start.

But now the quality of that education is\n            coming under scrutiny.
