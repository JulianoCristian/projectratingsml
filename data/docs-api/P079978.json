Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Ratings for the District Heating\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant.\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a supportive regulatory environment is crucial for\n            overcoming risk aversion to adopting new financing\n            instruments for energy efficiency projects, creating a level\n            playing field for a competitive Energy Service Company\n            (ESCO) market, and to ensure sustainability of energy\n            services. Ensuring reliable means for verifying energy\n            savings provides a clear basis for sharing the resulting\n            gains between the beneficiary and the financing source, and\n            therefore incentivizes energy efficiency efforts. The Energy\n            Efficiency project was unable to stimulate the ESCO market\n            beyond some sectors in the public domain due to remaining\n            regulatory and legal constraints (as for example in the\n            residential sector). There is a need for the Government to\n            coordinate its various ministries in order to provide common\n            technical and other support services, with a view to\n            mitigating risks for investors and consumers in renewable\n            energy efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Energy Efficiency Project;\n            Renewable Energy Resources Project; and
