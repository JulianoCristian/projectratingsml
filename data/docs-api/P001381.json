Given the role the Bank played in setting up the\n            labor-intensive operations, far more attention should have\n            been focused on the progress of the Labor Intensive\n            Construction Unit (LCU). More emphasis should have been put\n            on training, as in other labor-intensive programs supported\n            by the International Development Association (IDA) in\n            Africa, given the crucial role played by qualified\n            supervisors in the success of such programs. However, there\n            was no specific training program identified at appraisal. It\n            would have been beneficial to have had an engineer\n            experienced in labor-intensive methods review the operations\n            of LCU half way through the project in 1982, especially\n            since LCU has tended to use more equipment than other\n            similar programs. Funding of the brigades continued under\n            the Fourth Highway Project and although the supervision and\n            quality of work improved, the program has tended to drift\n            and has no clear objectives. The project was timely insofar\n            as it focused on maintenance requirements at a time when the\n            road network was increasing at a rapid pace. Although there\n            is still much room for improvement, maintenance standards in\n            Lesotho are still higher than in many other African\n            countries and maintenance costs are at a comparable level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -
