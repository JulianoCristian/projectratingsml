To achieve these objectives, a comprehensive\n            program of structural reforms is being carried out by the\n            government in the areas of industry, energy, and public\n            sector efficiency. In industry, the program includes import\n            liberalization, tariff and tax incentive reforms, further\n            liberalization of foreign investment, and restructuring of\n            the fertilizer industry. In energy, the program includes\n            measures to improve pricing and investment planning in the\n            electric power sector, pricing, taxation, and regulatory\n            reform of the petroleum and coal sectors, the introduction\n            of LNG, and measures to foster industrial and building\n            energy conservation. In the public sector, measures are\n            being taken to improve resource mobilization, reduce\n            budgetary deficits and increase efficiency of the public\n            sector through improved screening of expenditures and reform\n            of public enterprise management. The foreign exchange\n            provided by the loan would be used to finance essential imports."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Second Structural Adjustment Loan
