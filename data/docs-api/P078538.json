Some lessons learned include:\n            business management principles can be applied successfully\n            to HIV prevention interventions for sex workers, men who\n            have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDUs)\n            when they are regarded as clients to whom services need to\n            be marketed and delivered, with rigorous attention to\n            results, quality, and efficiency, and detailed monitoring\n            using a management information system in which data are\n            collected routinely and used to guide decisions, adjust\n            operating procedures, and propagate good practice.\n            Prevention can be effective when a tailored localized HIV\n            response relies on trusted community-based organizations\n            (CBOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as\n            front-line implementers. Detailed procedural and protocol\n            manuals, guidelines, and standards-backed with regular\n            training, with periodic review and updating to reflect best\n            practice-can greatly enhance the efficiency and quality of\n            program implementation. Developing a computerized management\n            system, and investment in on-site long-term technical\n            information technology (IT) support can have a strong\n            pay-off in debugging the system in its initial stages, and\n            then in seeking ways to improve and enhance the system to\n            take advantage of changing technology and to continuously\n            look for ways it can better support management decisions.\n            Country- and context-specific judgment is needed in deciding\n            which safeguard policies should usefully apply, instead of\n            bureaucratic box-ticking compliance that uses scarce time\n            and other resources without adding value or gains for\n            intended beneficiaries. Roles and responsibilities need to\n            be clearly defined so that this does not slip between two\n            stools of procurement and financial management units in an\n

However, HIV prevalence\n            has declined from 0.39 percent in 2004 to 0.31 percent in\n            2009 and recent data show that the number of new infections\n            was halved in the last decade. An impact evaluation\n            conducted in 2011 points to a decline in HIV among female\n            sex workers attributable to the program, and a 2011 cost\n            effectiveness analysis indicates that three million new\n            infections will be averted by the national program by 2015.\n            The Bank has been asked by the department of economic\n            affairs to support the fourth phase of the program as it\n            aims to accelerate reversal of trends and integrate\n            components of the program with other health services and\n            programs over the next program phase. The national program\n            will continue to innovate and generate lessons from its\n            innovative performance management system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Scaling up the response to HIV and AIDS to\n            successfully halt and reverse the epidemic"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Scaling up the response to HIV\n            and AIDS to successfully halt and reverse the epidemic"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/05/24536838/scaling-up-response-hiv-aids-successfully-halt-reverse-epidemic","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"female sex workers, treatment, sex workers,\n            hiv prevention interventions, hiv, donor, self help, sex\n            with men, deaths, effective prevention, aids control\n            project, prevention interventions, population groups,\n            services, discrimination, prevalence, hiv prevention,\n            health, transmission, epidemic, drug users, populations,\n            aids control, prevalence rates, use of condoms, number of\n            people, policy, new infections, sex, knowledge, high risk\n            groups, national aids, risk populations, partners,\n            infections, all, population, number of new infections, hiv\n            infections, aids, female, health services, epidemics,\n            behavior change, national aids control, condoms, aids\n            program, allocation of resources, injecting drug users"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Human development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Ampliaci\u00f3n de la respuesta al VIH y el\n            sida para detener y poner fin a la epidemia"}},"topic":"Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,HIV and AIDS m1327522 1416,Health Education m1327026 1463,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,HIV/AIDS and Education m1326805 1542","projn":"IN-India:  Third National Hiv/Aids Control\n            Project -- P078538","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Adolescent Health,Disease Control & Prevention,Gender and Health,Population Policies,AIDS HIV","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b082ec2373_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","theme":"Other social protection and risk management,Population and reproductive health,Health system performance,HIV/AIDS","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,HIV and AIDS m1327522 1416,Health Education m1327026 1463,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,HIV/AIDS and Education m1326805 1542","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
