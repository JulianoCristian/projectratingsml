Lessons from project experience confirms the\n            validity of the general project design, namely, the creation\n            of the Social Development Agency - ADS - enabled a learning\n            environment, and promoted the use of a constructive\n            self-evaluation mechanism, focused on self-improvement, and\n            improved program management. The ADS, and through it, the\n            implementation of the project, had a catalytic effect\n            because it demonstrated that a public agency, operating in\n            the social service sector, can be innovative, effective, and\n            achieve good results, in addition to demonstrating, and\n            confirming the successful use of private contractors.\n            Moreover, although the administrative framework of the ADS\n            is not designed on the typical worldwide model of autonomous\n            social funds, the agency is obtaining good results, and its\n            structure is well suited to the administrative environment\n            of the country. However, the studies carried out,\n            particularly social safety net program beneficiary\n            assessments, did not yield the expected results, as the\n            assessments were primarily based on quantitative, rather\n            than qualitative inputs; thus, during the second phase, the\n            terms of reference will be enhanced, to collect concrete\n            data on impact. Furthermore, in Algeria, the new concept of\n            a Community Development Program will require the application\n            of lessons learned, and increased efforts, elements that the\n            ADS management support so as to attain the desired program\n            impact. Nonetheless, it should be underlined that ADS\n            structures to implement individual programs, still need\n            support, particularly in light of recent changes made at the\n            administrative level, which have reduced ADS's\n            managerial flexibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Social Safety Net Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria -
