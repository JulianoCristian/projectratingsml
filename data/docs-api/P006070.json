The project objective was\n            to help implement major elements of the second phase of the\n            Government's long term plan to expand and upgrade the\n            country's training system. The project pursued two key\n            objectives, namely: (i) to provide institutional development\n            and improved policy implementation in training management\n            and finance; and (ii) to expand and upgrade training\n            capacity in combination with measures to use existing\n            training capacity more effectively. The overall outcome of\n            the project has been rated as moderately satisfactory. The\n            project was successful in improving the management and\n            sustainability of training, although more is still needed.\n            Key lessons learned can be summarized as follows: a) Policy\n            on sector development should be based on detailed sector\n            work, a broader stakeholder participation and better\n            commitment building; b) The Bank should initiate\n            restructuring of projects when political priorities change,\n            in order to retain ownership; c) Project objectives as\n            defined with the governments in the SAR should be realistic,\n            focused, and take into consideration the feasibility of\n            achieving major policy and institutional changes over the\n            short term; d) Supervision missions should be appropriately staffed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bahamas -
