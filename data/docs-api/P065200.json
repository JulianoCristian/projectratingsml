Some lessons learned included: the project\n            proved that communities' participation is positive for\n            biodiversity conservation, which was its original principle.\n            Indeed, communities were a driving force during project\n            execution through a participation process that encouraged\n            co-responsibility and intercultural dialogue. The project\n            demonstrated the feasibility of combining conventional\n            conservation with an indigenous conception of protected\n            areas as their living environment. The project showed that\n            co management required enabling indigenous communities by\n            building their capacity to directly execute activities\n            affecting their livelihoods. Training under the project\n            responded to this demand and has been a key element in the\n            development of the co management model because: (i) it is an\n            instrument that has helped to strengthen and empower people\n            to achieve social change; (ii) it was promoted as an\n            intercultural dialogue in which both sides learned from each\n            other; and (iii) it was custom-made to adapt to local\n            capacity and cultural background."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Indigenous Management of Protected\n            Areas in the Peruvian

There are four project components.

The second\n            component prepares management plans for titled indigenous\n            land; technical studies and demand and market studies; and\n            provides biodiversity investment sub-grants.
