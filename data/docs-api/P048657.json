through the deconcentration\n            to line agencies of the primary responsibility for\n            management of their financial resources; c) improve the\n            execution of public investment; and d) establish and/or\n            strengthen mechanisms to reduce corruption in public sector\n            spending.  The project has five components.  1) Extending\n            integrated financial management reforms will support reforms\n            in budgeting, accounting, cash management, procurement,\n            decentralization, information technology, legal framework,\n            and training.  2) Strengthening the Comptroller\n            General's Office (CGO) will cover external audit\n            system, CGO restructuring, change management, human resource\n            management, audit information technology system, audit\n            out-sourcing, and internal audit units.  3) Strengthening\n            public investment function will create a national system of\n            public investment, strengthen public investment plans,\n            decentralize investment design and execution, and reform\n            contracting process.  4) Strengthening public debt\n            management will be conducted through restructuring debt,\n            fees system, capital markets specialized unit, training, and\n            information technology system.  5) Project coordination will\n            oversee project development, procurement and
