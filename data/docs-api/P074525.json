The principal\n            objective of the project was to develop the capital markets\n            in the WAEMU region, and mobilize public and private\n            financing for the region infrastructure development. The\n            project is expected to contribute to the WAEMU countries\n            efforts to achieve sustainable regional economic growth\n            through the provision of efficient, region wide\n            infrastructure services and greater financial market\n            integration.

   conditions should be realistic; (iv) multi-donor operations\n            require clear and efficient implementation arrangements; (v)\n            the implementation of project activities co-financed by\n            different donors created practical; and (vi) project\n            supervision requires close oversight, and active\n            decision-making from management in light of

project paper concerns the approval\n            of the Executive Directors to introduce changes to the West\n            Africa Capital Market Development Project, for the West\n            Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The proposed\n            restructuring will help on several fronts to reach the\n            project. Expanding the eligibility criteria for project\n            financing under the line of credit will have two advantages:\n            (i) bringing the program more in line with market demand by\n            expanding the eligibility criteria of the credit line to\n            encompass other non-road infrastructure sub-projects; and\n            (ii) increasing the opportunity for regional integration\n            through the financing of other non-road infrastructure\n            projects. By extending the closing date by two years, there\n            will be sufficient time to fully implement the reforms and\n            successfully complete the project activities and to meet\n            their development objectives. It is anticipated that demand\n            for financing may surpass available funding. It was agreed\n            that if the restructuring was completed and the\n            International Development Association (IDA) credit was\n            extended, Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)\n            would also extend the closing date of i t s trust fund to\n            enable West African Development Bank (BOAD) to complete the\n            technical assistance program. By restructuring the guarantee\n            facility, Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)\n            will be able to provide guarantee to larger infrastructure\n            projects presented by BOAD. Also, the Technical Assistance\n            (TA) to be provided on risk mitigation will allow BOAD to\n            move away from its traditional focus on financing public\n            projects and help BOAD finance private infrastructure\n            projects through diverse financing options. There are three\n            changes: (a) expand the eligibility criteria of the LOC to\n            (i) include other infrastructure projects in addition to\n            roads; (ii) increase the ceiling of sub-projects be funded\n            under the line of credit; and (iii) include cross-border\n            projects related to food security; (b) cancel the guarantee\n            facility; and (c) extend the credit closing date by two\n            years from September 30, 2009 to September 30, 2011 and the\n            IDA managed CIDA trust fund by two years to March 31,

To this end, one of its components supports the\n            development of a strategy towards an integrated transport\n            sector, backed by the Roads Sector Environmental and Social\n            Management Framework Study, which assesses global\n            environmental, and social conditions as related to road\n            construction. This environmental management plan (EMP)\n            reviews the study, and accordingly, identifies mitigation\n            measures, applicable to the West Africa countries - Benin,\n            Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali,\n            Niger, Senegal, and Togo - to minimize environmental\n            adversity as a result of road construction. Mainly, this EMP\n            endorses the Framework Study recommendations, and\n            incorporates measures as follows. The West African\n            Development Bank will establish environmental and social\n            guidelines, provide technical assistance (TA), and ensure\n            mechanisms to enforce environmental protection regulations.\n            Specifically, regarding the roads sector, and following\n            public awareness campaigns, member states should adopt\n            directives for inclusion of precautionary clauses in road\n            construction contracts that include water and soil pollution\n            control, noise abatement, waste management control, and\n            traffic safety measures.
