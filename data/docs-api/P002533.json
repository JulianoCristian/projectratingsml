The project will accomplish this latter\n            item by facilitating future financing of other plantations\n            in the cocoa subsector; creating applied research capacities\n            in the food crop subsector; (iii) supporting smallholders\n            development; and (iv) addressing other issues through\n            studies and consulting services.  This latter element will\n            assist the Government in formulating and implementing its\n            policies, in diversifying  its agricultural base, and in\n            shifting the status of its state enterprises to that of\n            mixed-economy enterprises."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sao Tome and Principe -
