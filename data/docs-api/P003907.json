Some lessons learned\n            included: sustainability in a large forest resource can only\n            be developed over a long term, integrated and sequenced\n            involvement in the sector: to the extent possible, provision\n            should be made for this kind of long term Bank involvement\n            right from the beginning of the initial operation. Inputs to\n            enhance the technical and human resources capacity of\n            forestry agencies to deal with the fundamental problem of\n            long-term sustainability of Indonesia's forest will\n            have limited impact in the longer run if concomitant shifts\n            in policies and incentives are not introduced by the\n            governments.
