Increased focus\n            on generating community feedback in the Nigeria Fadama\n            project, funded by the World Bank, is helping to improve\n            rural livelihoods by deepening the quality and quantity of\n            communication between development practitioners,\n            governments, and community members. The farmers have\n            struggled in the face of grinding poverty and livelihoods\n            have been undercut by low agricultural yields. The project\n            has developed a vibrant network of inclusive community\n            networks. It has also launched a promising mobile phone and\n            SMS-based system that will allow beneficiaries to provide\n            feedback on a variety of indicators from the performance of\n            project staff to suggestions on how to improve the timing of\n            funds disbursement. It is currently operating in all the 36\n            states of Nigeria including the Federal Capital Territory.\n            The World Bank has also provided technical assistance,\n            drawing upon its experience with community driven\n            development approaches in other countries. Fadama project\n            has built strong networks of community associations and user\n            groups and piloting of an SMS network should be seen as a\n            starting point for a system of feedback mechanisms that can\n            provide both more quantitative and more qualitative\n            information on project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -

Nevertheless,\n            the performance of the Bank was marginally satisfactory, for\n            although considerable flexibility was given during\n            implementation, supervision was negligent due to the lack of\n            appropriate procurement planning, and transparency in the\n            selection process. Similarly, the performance of the\n            Borrower gave mixed results, particularly, due to the\n            untimely release of counterpart funds, and, delays during\n            implementation because of late budgetary, and project\n            approvals. The lessons convey primarily, the importance of\n            beneficiary participation in both the design, and\n            implementation stages of projects, to enhance project\n            ownership, and increase loan repayment. This flexibility\n            allows the inclusion of beneficiaries' suggestions, -\n            as in this case - on appropriate usage, and location of\n            pumps, which proved successful for water availability.\n            Private sector involvement can greatly improve project\n            sustainability, as will, that from non-governmental\n            organizations, and local governments, if agreed early on,\n            ensuring greater commitment.
