The evaluation cites four\n            major factors that make sustainability likely. The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            assessed as satisfactory overall. These are among the\n            lessons learned: 1) The project has clearly demonstrated\n            that the delegation of contract management and reliance on\n            private consultants are powerful and successful means of\n            leveraging the otherwise linited municipal capabilities. The\n            partnership among the municipalities, the public works\n            executing agency of Mauritania (AMEXTIPE), and private\n            consultants was effective in that consultants and AMEXTIPE\n            alike contributed technical know-how and professionalism,\n            while the municipalities provided intimate knowledge of the\n            preferences of their constituencies. It allowed\n            municipalities to leverage their otherwise weak capacities.\n            2) Organizing and staffing the relevant vital services of\n            municipalities and the local government directorate and\n            building their capacities should have accompanied the\n            introduction of the managmeent tools introduced byy the\n            project--city performance contracts and audits--or even\n            preceded it. 3) Enhancing the competitiveness of local\n            construction and engineering firms requires sustained\n            efforts by an appropriate mix of specialized institutions.\n            Such responsibility is well beyond the scope of AMEXTIPE and\n            is incongruent with the need to enforce stringent post\n            qualification and other selection criteria."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Urban Infrastructure and Pilot\n            Decentralization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritania -
