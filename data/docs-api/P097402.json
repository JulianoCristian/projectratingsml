Some lessons learned included: the\n            project had a simple design, procurement by United Nations\n            Children's Fund (UNICEF), and a straightforward\n            objective of supporting one component of a larger\n            effectively functioning national program. With a relatively\n            simple project design and objectives, it was easier to\n            measure success. This principle could be applied to projects\n            across sectors and countries; however it does need to be\n            acknowledged that development issues often do not have\n            simple solutions, and hence the complexity of many Bank\n            projects. Also, the simple design could have compromised the\n            Bank's role to have an effective dialogue for the\n            entire Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI). The project\n            was entirely implemented by the existing EPI management unit\n            and hence sustainable after project completion. Ensuring\n            realistic indictors to measure project success is important.\n            The Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) supply indicator as developed\n            was ambitious, and when developed did not take into account\n            the global OPV demand-supply situation. At the same time, an\n            early recognition of the inappropriateness of an indicator\n            and revising/changing it can be critical to project success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Partnership for Polio\n            Eradication Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Partnership for\n            Polio Eradication Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/12/10297203/pakistan-second-partnership-polio-eradication-project","projn":"PK-Pakistan: Second Partnership For Polio\n            Eradication Project -- P097402","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business,Disease Control & Prevention","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20090227020350"},"theme":"Child health","subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acute Flaccid Paralysis, aged, blindness,\n            Child health, cold chain, communicable diseases,\n            communication activities, communication strategy,\n            communities, community involvement, confirmed Polio Cases,\n            delivery system, description, disease, districts, effective\n            use, endemic countries, epidemiological surveillance,\n            epidemiology, eradication of polio, female, financial\n            benefits, Financial Management, financial resources,\n            financing plan, Front-end, Gender, geographical areas,\n            global eradication, Global Polio Eradication Initiative,\n            Health Management, health outcomes, Health Services, Health\n            Workers, HIV, hospitals, households, human resources, ID,\n            Immunization, Immunization Activities, implementation\n            period, implementation plan, implementation strategy,\n            Implementing Agencies, Implementing Agency, Infant\n            Mortality, infants, innovation, institution,\n            institutionalization, international standards, IP, live\n            births, living conditions, management system, maternal and\n            child health, maternal deaths, maternal mortality, maternal\n            mortality ratio, migration, mobile teams, mobility,\n            monitoring mechanism, Mortality, national surveillance,\n            nutrition, patients, performance indicator, Performance\n            Indicators, personal communication, POLIO, polio\n            elimination, POLIO ERADICATION, polio eradication program,\n            Polio Vaccine, polio-free areas, polio-free countries,\n            poliomyelitis, polioviruses, population groups, posters,\n            primary health care, procurement, project management, public\n            health, radio, result, RESULTS, risk groups, screening,\n            sites, Social Development, storage facilities, Supervision,\n            targets, technical assistance, technical experts, technical\n            issues, technical support, television, towns, transmission,\n            treatment, vaccination, vaccines, verification, villages,\n            Vitamin A, Vitamin A deficiency, waste, Wild Polio Virus, Workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
