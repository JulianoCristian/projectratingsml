Some lessons include:\n            selective targeting of implementing agencies. The project\n            design clearly identified implementing agencies and assigned\n            specific tasks to each one, resulting in a clear\n            implementation plan. Such a design had been shown to work\n            well in other similar projects, namely in Saint Lucia and\n            Guyana. Selecting key, measurable indicators. The country\n            would also benefit from a more focused and shorter list of\n            indicators that need to be tracked. While SVG has been\n            generally able to report on key indicators, other countries\n            with weak Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) capacity and\n            culture often have difficulties in collecting large sets of\n            data, which may in fact hinder progress. Supporting broader\n            health systems strengthening. SVG's Health Management\n            Information System (HMIS), financed through this Project,\n            has a broader impact beyond HIV/AIDS. Transitioning staff\n            for sustainability. Within the Government infrastructure,\n            the ability to retain technical staff after project closure\n            is a necessary requirement to guarantee operational\n            sustainability, as well as to solidify the gains achieved\n            under the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines - HIV/AIDS\n            Prevention and Control
