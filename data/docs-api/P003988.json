The first component is a Fellowships and\n            Training Component which consists of three subcomponents\n            which will provide domestic and overseas degree and\n            non-degree fellowships to professional, managerial, and\n            science and technology staff of key government ministries\n            and agencies at national and local levels; overseas\n            fellowships in appropriate professional, managerial and\n            technical subjects not yet available in Indonesia; improve\n            reentry procedures for the utilization of past, present and\n            future fellowship holders; and facilitate overseas degree\n            and non-degree programs of private and public firms by\n            making available such services as testing, placement and\n            monitoring. The second component will assist the National\n            Steering Team for Overseas Training (NASTOT) in playing a\n            more effective role in formulating policy, coordinating and\n            monitoring the civil service fellowships and the pilot\n            programs for fresh graduates, and undertaking the studies to\n            lead to development of a possible new merit-based fellowship scheme."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Professional Human\n            Resource Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second Professional\n            Human Resource Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/11/732824/indonesia-second-professional-human-resource-development-project","projn":"ID-Phrd II -- P003988","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Agricultural Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007044732"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Tertiary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population,(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agribusiness,Agriculture,audit\n            reports,audits,BANK LOANS,Capital markets,civil\n            service,competitive\n            environment,Crops,decentralization,deregulation,Economic\n            Rate of Return,environmental impact,expenditures,export\n            growth,exports,Financial Sector,Financial services,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Fisheries,foreign exchange,Forestry,GDP,GDP growth\n            rate,human capital,Industrial\n            Development,industrialization,Integrated Pest\n            Management,interest rate,Irrigation,Low\n            Income,Nutrition,Price Increases,private sector,public\n            services,Rural Electrification,Rural Roads,tax\n            laws,Technical Assistance,technological\n            innovations,technology transfer,Telecommunications,training\n            activities,training programs,Urban Development,Water\n            Supply,Watershed,Watershed Management"},"1":{"cdata!":"agribusiness,Agriculture,audit\n            reports,audits,BANK LOANS,Capital markets,civil\n            service,competitive\n            environment,Crops,decentralization,deregulation,Economic\n            Rate of Return,environmental impact,expenditures,export\n            growth,exports,Financial Sector,Financial services,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Fisheries,foreign exchange,Forestry,GDP,GDP growth\n            rate,human capital,Industrial\n            Development,industrialization,Integrated Pest\n            Management,interest rate,Irrigation,Low\n            Income,Nutrition,Price Increases,private sector,public\n            services,Rural Electrification,Rural Roads,tax\n            laws,Technical Assistance,technological\n            innovations,technology transfer,Telecommunications,training\n            activities,training programs,Urban Development,Water\n            Supply,Watershed,Watershed Management"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"P6427"},"facets":{}}}
