The following are among the\n            more important project lessons: (1) this project raised\n            issues concerning blended versus standalone projects and the\n            Bank's effectiveness in delivering on the latter. The\n            justification for the standalone was far weaker and the\n            decision entailed many implementation difficulties. Blended\n            projects should have mitigation measures including\n            restructuring if appropriate - should such an operation not\n            proceed or for some other reason, the linked approach does\n            not function. (2) Inter-institutional coordination and open\n            internal communication are essential for conservation and\n            biodiversity interventions which rely on broad consensus and\n            solidarity to maintain momentum. (3) Changes in higher level\n            positions within the project coordination unit must be\n            accompanied by an intense, accelerated induction process to\n            build understanding concerning the project concept,\n            methodology, stage of achievement, and difficulties\n            encountered prior to the changeover. This is essential to\n            generate and strengthen channels of communication among\n            project authorities and related institutions, and garner\n            commitment. (4) Mobilizing citizen participation can have\n            major impacts on the sustainability of otherwise\n            controversial conservation activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -
