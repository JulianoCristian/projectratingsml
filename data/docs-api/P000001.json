Lessons learned:\n            Community-Based Natural Resource and Wildlife Management\n            Project (GEPRENAF's) success in bringing about policy\n            changes in the management of natural resources demonstrates\n            that a few carefully calculated risks can produce valuable\n            results. In approaches such as GEPRENAF's that rely on\n            sustaining community commitment to conservation and\n            sustainable use of wild resources through the\n            materialization of future economic benefits, the design\n            should err on the side of caution. In both countries, the\n            AGEREFs and the inter-village development committees favored\n            local development activities over conservation work. The\n            GEPRENAF approach tested a model that fully empowers\n            communities. Modern wildlife management is a complex and\n            highly technical operation that should be conducted by\n            trained, experienced professionals, and not by amateurs. The\n            project signed several protocols with government agencies\n            and NGOs for the provision of technical services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire - West\n            Africa Pilot Community-Based Natural Resources and Wildlife\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso and Cote\n            d'Ivoire - West Africa Pilot Community-Based Natural\n            Resources and Wildlife Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6050764/burkina-faso-cote-divoire-west-africa-pilot-community-based-natural-resources-wildlife-management-project","projn":"3A-West Africa Pilot Community-Based Natural\n            Resources & Wildlife -- P000001","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050708092221"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Global Environment Project","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Research, agriculture, animal\n            health, audits, Biodiversity, biodiversity conservation,\n            blindness, concession, conservation activities, conservation\n            of biodiversity, dams, decentralization, decision making,\n            economic impact, Ecosystem, Ecosystem Management,\n            ecosystems, Endangered Species, Environmental policies,\n            equipment, Exchange Rate, Expenditures, exploitation,\n            extension, feasibility studies, Financial management,\n            fishing, flood protection, forest, forest guard, Forest\n            Policy, forest products, forest service, Forestry, forestry\n            sector, habitat management, hunting, hunting regulations,\n            income, integration, intervention, inventories, Land\n            administration, land areas, Land Management, land tenure,\n            land tenure security, land use, laws, legislation,\n            livestock, local authorities, migration, national\n            accounting, Natural Resource, natural resource base, Natural\n            Resource Management, NATURAL RESOURCES, natural resources\n            management, new technologies, NGOs, nurses, participatory\n            approaches, Partnership, pastoralists, plots, population\n            dynamics, poverty alleviation, Present Value, primary\n            schools, private sector, quality of life, quotas, radio,\n            rural development, social services, streams, sustainable\n            use, timber, WILDLIFE, wildlife conservation, wildlife populations"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 4 (AFTS4)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020460-NORWEGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF022100-ITALIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF022565-PHRD-STRUCT.ADJ.CREDIT I/REG.ENTERP.DEV.,TF022982-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT-AFRICA,TF025142-WEST AFRICAN PILOT\n            COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL RESOURCE AND WILDLIFE MANAGE,TF025143-PILOT COMMUNITY-BASED NATURAL\n            RESOURCES AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF026105-SAHELIAN NATURAL RESOURCE MGT SUPPORT,TF028302-GEF1-BURKINA FASO GEPRENAF,TF028303-GEF1-COTE D'IVOIRE GEPRENAF,TF028502-FOOD SECTOR REFORM,TF028503-HOUSING REFORM,TF028504-PETRO LEGIS RUSSIA,TF028505-PETRO LEGIS KAZAKH,TF028506-OIL PIPE.

Segmented into four main objectives the project\n            seeks to: 1) strengthen the capacity of local communities,\n            nongovernmental organizations and government to manage wild\n            plant and animal resources in a sustainable manner; 2) to\n            improve the managmement and use of habitat and wildlife\n            populations at each site; 3) to improve local land\n            management practices and infrastructure; and 4) to establish\n            a durable system for monitoring and evaluating project\n            implementation and impact. There are four components to\n            achieve this objective: support for local-level capacity\n            building; implementation of habitat and wildlife management\n            measures; land management and infrastructure development;\n            and project management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire -
