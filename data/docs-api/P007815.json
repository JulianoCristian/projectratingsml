Bank\n            supervision missions were frequent. They were mostly\n            combined with other supervision missions in Madagascar to\n            save resources. Staff involved adhered to project objectives\n            and were able to convince Government of the need to limit\n            design options and minimize investment costs. The major\n            findings and lessons learned are: It is important to keep a\n            project such as this one simple and focused. When\n            considerable uncertainty exists on available options, the\n            design phase of a large project should be separated from the\n            implementation phase in order to avoid lengthy delays. A\n            master plan for the rehabilitation and long-term development\n            of the Plain was completed and designed to minimize\n            investment needs and maximize economic benefits, to improve\n            the flood-warning system for the lower town of Antananarivo,\n            and to provide for institutional coordination of major\n            structures in the plain. The master plan was ultimately used\n            as the basis for preparing the Antananarivo Plain\n            Development Project. It also led to significant donor\n            support for other projects on the Plain."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Sixth Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Sixth Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/12/736353/panama-sixth-power-project","projn":"PA-Power VI Distributio -- P007815","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,National Governance,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Panama","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925170650"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounts,accounts\n            receivable,authorization,Bank Lending,Bank supervision,bid\n            documents,bills,Borrower,borrowing,Borrowings,budgetary\n            autonomy,centralization,competitive\n            bidding,conditionality,Contractors,cost of capital,cost\n            overruns,cost recovery,counterpart,current\n            prices,debt,Decree,disbursement,disbursements,execution,expansion\n            plan,expenditure,expenditures,financial autonomy,financial\n            difficulties,financial management,Financial\n            Performance,Financial Ratios,Fiscal,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,Government agency,Guarantee\n            Agreements,illiquidity,institutional autonomy,internal cash\n            generation,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreement,Loan\n            disbursements,loan effectiveness,LRMC,maintenance\n            costs,marginal costs,Nations,Operating Revenue,political\n            confrontation,Presidency,procurement,public sector,public\n            service,purchasing,quality of service,regulatory\n            body,rehabilitation,reorganization,representatives,Return on\n            Investment,Sales,savings,technical assistance,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounts,accounts\n            receivable,authorization,Bank Lending,Bank supervision,bid\n            documents,bills,Borrower,borrowing,Borrowings,budgetary\n            autonomy,centralization,competitive\n            bidding,conditionality,Contractors,cost of capital,cost\n            overruns,cost recovery,counterpart,current\n            prices,debt,Decree,disbursement,disbursements,execution,expansion\n            plan,expenditure,expenditures,financial autonomy,financial\n            difficulties,financial management,Financial\n            Performance,Financial Ratios,Fiscal,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,Government agency,Guarantee\n            Agreements,illiquidity,institutional autonomy,internal cash\n            generation,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreement,Loan\n            disbursements,loan effectiveness,LRMC,maintenance\n            costs,marginal costs,Nations,Operating Revenue,political\n            confrontation,Presidency,procurement,public sector,public\n            service,purchasing,quality of service,regulatory\n            body,rehabilitation,reorganization,representatives,Return on\n            Investment,Sales,savings,technical assistance,working capital"}},"owner":"Central America Countries CMU (LCC2C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"repnb":"11456"},"18217930":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/06/18217930/panama-sixth-power-project-loan-2313-loan-agreement-conformed","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/06/18217930/panama-sixth-power-project-loan-2313-loan-agreement-conformed","new_url":"1983/06/18217930/panama-sixth-power-project-loan-2313-loan-agreement-conformed","disclosure_date":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b081e999ba","chronical_docm_id":"090224b081e999ba","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2013/09/08/090224b081e999ba/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/Panama000Sixth0greement000Conformed.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2013/09/08/090224b081e999ba/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Panama000Sixth0greement000Conformed.pdf","loan_no":"2313","datestored":"2013-09-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1983-06-09T14:05:06Z","docna":{"cdata!":"Panama -
