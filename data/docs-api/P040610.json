Some lessons learned included: low\n            institutional capacity of government departments and\n            implementing agencies, which is all the more pronounced in\n            low-income states, will negatively impact project\n            implementation and outcomes. In addition to providing\n            needs-based training to staff and officers of government\n            departments and implementing agencies, more consistent\n            technical assistance may be needed to generate the behavior\n            change and skills upgrading required to manage more\n            technically sophisticated water management systems. To\n            achieve sustainable management of groundwater, it is\n            essential to have commitment of the community. Information,\n            education and communication are essential for motivating\n            communities to the need for restraint and cooperation in the\n            use of groundwater. This takes a lot of time but can be made\n            to work with enabling legislation together with the active\n            and continued technical support to the community\n
