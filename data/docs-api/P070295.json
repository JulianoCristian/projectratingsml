The main lesson of this project is that the\n            Bank can play a productive role in providing support in\n            urgent operations dealing with post-conflict situations,\n            provided there is a pragmatic approach to the issues at\n            hand. The success of the Kosovo Urgent Road Project can be\n            explained by: (i) the simplicity of the project, which\n            focused on the indispensable capacity needed in the public\n            and private sectors to keep the operability of the road\n            network; and (ii) the willingness of the Bank to adapt the\n            requirements of project preparation to the urgency of the\n            project, accepting the trade-offs between short lead-times\n            and limited data gathering and background studies. This was\n            done with the knowledge that the recommended actions would\n            not be substantially changed if there would have been time\n            for extensive preparation. The project highlights the\n            importance of the long term efforts necessary to achieve\n            lasting improvements in institutional performance, the more\n            so when those improvements are not limited to technical\n            know-how but involve a profound revision of cultural mores."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo -

The three main\n            components will: 1) provide funding for road maintenance, on\n            those sections of the main network not requiring\n            rehabilitation, but in need of maintenance to remain\n            serviceable. Maintenance works will cover approximately\n            1,500 km of the main network, and will include treatment of\n            potholes, surface dressing, cleaning of drainage systems,\n            and road signaling, to restore traffic safety; 2) perform\n            road rehabilitation activities, on approximately 150 km of\n            the main network, and will include restoration of\n            culverts/drainage systems, overlays. Only a selective\n            emergency reconstruction will be performed, on those\n            sections almost destructed, given the scarce availability of\n            funds. Overlay works will be performed on a high priority\n            stretch of the Pristina-Gnjilane road; and, 3) support the\n            re-establishment of a core road management capacity in\n            Kosovo, providing technical assistance to the Directorate of\n            Roads, in road maintenance, capacity building, and project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia -
