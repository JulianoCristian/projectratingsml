Some lessons learned\n            includes: the program demonstrated the potential for\n            increased use of budget support modalities in Samoa. The\n            program was successful in achieving important development\n            objectives, despite low monitoring effort and limited Bank\n            engagement in ongoing policy dialogue around program\n            implementation. Close coordination and engagement with other\n            donors in the identification of policy priorities is a\n            useful approach in sectors where the Bank has limited\n            knowledge and engagement. In the Pacific Island Countries,\n            the Bank does not have sufficient presence to maintain\n            in-depth knowledge of all sectors across all countries.\n            Development policy operations can be quickly mobilized and\n            achieve good results in the context of strong reform\n            momentum. With the Government's strong ownership of a\n            broad on-going reform agenda the Bank was able to identify\n            substantive and realistic policy actions to support through\n            the program within short timeframes. Project-level\n            engagement can assist in identifying key priorities to be\n            supported through policy operations. Prior project\n            engagement provided a vital foundation for design,\n            implementation, and monitoring of the program. Coordinated\n            management of international aid flows, in the context of\n            prudent fiscal policy, can provide vital support in\n            mitigating impacts of external shocks in small Pacific\n            states. Without the international support provided to Samoa\n            in responding to the global economic crisis and the tsunami,\n            the impacts of both would almost certainly have been more\n            extensive and longer lasting. Improved knowledge and data is\n            required to track the impact of reforms on the extent and\n            distribution of poverty in Samoa. There is a high degree of\n            confidence among the Government of Samoa and donors that the\n            program and broader policy response to the global economic\n            crisis and tsunami has positive impacts on the poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Samoa - Economic Crisis Recovery Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Samoa - Economic Crisis

         Credit Program for Samoa aims to support the\n            government's efforts to counter the impacts of the\n            global economic crisis that have been exacerbated by the\n            tsunami, and facilitate medium term recovery. Even in these\n            challenging circumstances the government has stayed broadly\n            on-track with its reform agenda, largely articulated in the\n            Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS). The policy\n            actions included in this operation will help maintain the\n            reform momentum, while at the same time supporting the\n            government's recovery measures. The operation\n            selectively covers a small set of policy actions in four key\n            areas: (i) assisting with economic recovery, particularly in\n            the tourism sector; (ii) instituting mechanisms to protect\n            the vulnerable; (iii) progressing on public financial\n            management reforms to ensure that fiscal discipline is\n            maintained at a time when public expenditure is increasing\n            rapidly; and (iv) public enterprise reform to strengthen\n            infrastructure service delivery to support medium term\n            recovery. The Supplementary Budget passed in January 2010\n            increased allocations to protect the vulnerable and support\n            private sector activity. Government of Samoa (GoS) requested\n            all stakeholders including the development partners to\n            assist in this effort. The operation carries a moderate risk\n            on account of the limited institutional capacity of the GoS\n            which is currently stretched due to the major crises that\n            have occurred in the last two years. In addition the\n            external economic environment, while improving, remains\n            unsettled. Samoa's high vulnerability to external\n            economic factors implies that the government's ability\n            to maintain macroeconomic stability, restore growth and\n            achieve fiscal consolidation in the medium term will\n            continue to be tested."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Samoa - Economic Crisis Recovery Support\n            Credit
