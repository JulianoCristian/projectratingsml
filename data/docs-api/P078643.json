Some lessons\n            learned included: regional projects are difficult and entail\n            specificities that require close attention. They often\n            progress at the pace of the slowest stakeholders, as all\n            countries face different implementation contexts, and\n            coordination with different cultures and languages is a\n            challenge. In that setting, the design of any regional\n            project should be kept simple, unambiguous, and streamlined\n            wherever possible. Inadequate preparation and design has\n            lasting impacts on its implementation, efficiency and\n            eventually its outcomes. In the context of a regional\n            project, robust preparation work is even more essential, and\n            the true commitment of each government and its agencies\n            should be ensured before the start of the project. Through\n            adequate collaboration and positive cross-stimulation, South\n            African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) and Indian Ocean\n            Commission (IOC) have been able to advance their own field\n            of expertise with very good results and in part compensate\n            for a suboptimal preparation. It has been noted that pairing\n            two implementing agencies is likely to complicate any\n            substantial restructuring, the project requires. Obtaining\n            buy-in and ensuring sustainability are therefore far from\n            being straightforward, and should be given more explicit\n            consideration at design stage for this type of project. More\n            importantly, sustainability arrangements can quickly become\n            collateral casualties of difficulties that arise during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa - GEF- Western Indian Ocean Marine\n            Highway Development and Coastal and Marine Contamination\n            Prevention Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa -
