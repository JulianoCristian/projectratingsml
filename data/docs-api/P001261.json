The study has drawn some key conclusions: 1) The\n            projects helped support the rapid economic growth, and raise\n            the standard of living in Nairobi throughout the last two\n            decades. Particularly in the field of water supply and\n            sanitation, the results are sustainable. On the other hand,\n            although progress was made in developing housing programs,\n            no lasting impact was achieved in terms of housing policies\n            and cost recovery in the housing sector. In the area of\n            institutional development, the Water and Sewerage Department\n            of the Nairobi City Council serves as a good example of\n            substantial achievements on effective capacity building. The\n            report presents recommendations for future operations in the\n            areas of sequencing of technical assistance and investment\n            intervention, design of housing

It provides for construction of physical\n            infrastructure and community facilities to serve existing\n            unserved squatter settlements, preparation of new housing\n            areas with serviced plots, credit for house improvements and\n            new house buildings, and employment opportunities. In\n            Kenya's three largest cities Kisumu, Mombasa and\n            Nairobi, more than 30,000 low-income households will benefit\n            directly from the project. There are no special risks.\n            However, the economic rate of return could be reduced from\n            16% to about 14% should overall market rental levels be\n            substantially lower than expected.
