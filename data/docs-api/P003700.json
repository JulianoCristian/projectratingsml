Some key lessons learned are: A\n            satisfactory business environment is necessary for success\n            in a market development project. Market-based projects\n            should provide broad scope for companies to adjust product\n            lines and business models to meet changing market signals.\n            Both front-loaded and performance based grant support help\n            induce retail market entry by for-profit companies for a\n            variety of reasons. Project design should focus as much on\n            profitability as on affordability. Performance based grants\n            for solar home systems sales in retail markets should scale\n            down during implementation to facilitate transition of\n            companies to commercial operations. A convincing end-user\n            audit program and transparent grant releases encourages\n            companies to participate in the project and follow the\n            consumer protection requirements. Support to financial\n            organizations is necessary to increase their knowledge of\n            the market. The household and institutional market segments\n            should be targeted in an integrated way in order to achieve\n            sustainable access and development impacts. Highly\n            subsidized systems made available to consumers through\n            government and donor supported programs can undercut market\n            development based projects. A carefully designed\n            socio-economic survey mechanism should be built in the SHS\n            projects to assess the development impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Solar Home Systems Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Solar Home Systems Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4637770/indonesia-solar-home-systems-project","projn":"ID-Solar Home Systems -- P003700","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Access to Markets,Markets and Market Access","teratopic":"International Economics and Trade","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040630104957"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Renewable energy","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"International Economics and Trade","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actual costs,auditing,audits,Bank\n            Performance,banking sector,banking services,capacity\n            building,Carbon,Carbon Dioxide,Central Bank,Climate\n            change,coffee prices,commercial\n            banks,commercialization,commodity\n            prices,competitiveness,consumer protection,consumer\n            satisfaction,consumer surplus,consumers,cost analysis,cost\n            savings,credit approval,crowding out,demand\n            curve,devaluation,discount rate,down payments,economic\n            conditions,economic development,Economic Rate of\n            Return,emissions,Exchange Rate,expenditures,financial\n            crisis,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,fossil\n            fuels,income,inflation,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,key performance indicators,local\n            government,LRMC,Marginal Cost,market conditions,market\n            penetration,market prices,marketing,Mines,nominal\n            prices,oil,oil prices,Present Value,problem loans,producer\n            prices,purchasing,recapitalization,replacement\n            costs,retail,retail prices,rural communities,sales,supply\n            chains,Technical Assistance,Willingness To Pay,WTP"},"1":{"cdata!":"actual costs,auditing,audits,Bank\n            Performance,banking sector,banking services,capacity\n            building,Carbon,Carbon Dioxide,Central Bank,Climate\n            change,coffee prices,commercial\n            banks,commercialization,commodity\n            prices,competitiveness,consumer protection,consumer\n            satisfaction,consumer surplus,consumers,cost analysis,cost\n            savings,credit approval,crowding out,demand\n            curve,devaluation,discount rate,down payments,economic\n            conditions,economic development,Economic Rate of\n            Return,emissions,Exchange Rate,expenditures,financial\n            crisis,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,fossil\n            fuels,income,inflation,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,key performance indicators,local\n            government,LRMC,Marginal Cost,market conditions,market\n            penetration,market prices,marketing,Mines,nominal\n            prices,oil,oil prices,Present Value,problem loans,producer\n            prices,purchasing,recapitalization,replacement\n            costs,retail,retail prices,rural communities,sales,supply\n            chains,Technical Assistance,Willingness To Pay,WTP"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022865-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY &\n            PROJECT DEV.,TF023485-USDOE-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY ACTIVITIES,TF024995-USTDA-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT,TF028488-GEF1-INDONESIA SOLAR HOME\n            SYSTEMS PROJECT,TF029633-PHRD-SOLAR HOMES SYSTEMS (SHS) PROJ.","repnb":"29153"},"facets":{}}}
