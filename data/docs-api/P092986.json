Cross-sector\n            approach could work if there is synergy: e.g. government\n            debt management in public sector reform (e.g. forecasting,\n            planning and cash management) and domestic bond market\n            development in financial sector reform. The institutional\n            capacity of the Bank's managing unit, as well as of the\n            client and the implementing agencies, has to be considered\n            when determining how wide a sector-wide approach should be.\n            Given the open-endedness of the PSR program in the design\n            phase, it appears an adaptable or more phased-in instrument\n            will be more fitting. There was only one QER close to the\n            decision meeting for appraisal and project negotiation. It\n            appears that before the project was submitted for Board\n            review, the design was not checked to see if the QER and\n            decision meeting recommendations were incorporated. The\n            financial sector part of the project benefited from strong\n            ownership of the reform strategy by the Government of Ghana\n            (GOG) and the regulatory authorities, thanks to the\n            participatory approach in years of Financial Sector\n            Strategic Plan (FINSSP) development. The regular Financial\n            Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) updates (2003, 2006 and\n            2011) gave the Bank a handle on the status of Ghana's\n            financial sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Economic Management Capacity\n            Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Economic Management\n            Capacity Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/11/18638349/ghana-economic-management-capacity-building-project","projn":"GH-Economic Management Cap.

Economic Management\n            Capacity Building Project for Ghana is to support the\n            recipient to perform its role as a facilitator for economic\n            development through: (i) implementation by Ministries,\n            Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of a reform initiative for\n            improved public sector management and service delivery; and\n            (ii) strengthening of the governance and competitiveness of\n            the financial sector. This paper seeks approval from the\n            Country Director for a second-order restructuring plan for\n            the project based on the results of the midterm review\n            conducted in August 2009, and the slower than anticipated\n            implementation pace thereafter. The restructuring will allow\n            refocusing the activities on outstanding priorities, and\n            improving overall project implementation performance. The\n            closing date of the project, originally set for June 30,\n            2011, will be extended by 18 months, until December 30, 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Economic Management\n            Capacity Building Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14415933/ghana-economic-management-capacity-building-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"GH-Economic Management Cap.
