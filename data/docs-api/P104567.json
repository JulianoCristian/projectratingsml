Some lessons learned included:\n            the productive partnerships approach can be a cost-effective\n            way to boost productivity, expand production, improve\n            competitiveness, and link farmers to markets. Selection of\n            sub-projects through an open, competitive process based on\n            clearly defined technical evaluation criteria can be crucial\n            for establishing credibility among stakeholders and avoiding\n            political interference. Accompanying producer groups over an\n            extended period while they grow and mature is crucial for\n            ensuring long-term success. Transition planning for World\n            Bank-financed projects should begin early and not left to\n            the final months of implementation. Successful projects that\n            are not effective in communicating their achievements to key\n            audiences may have difficulty securing funding going\n            forward.

objective of the Second\n            Rural Productive Partnerships Project for Colombia is to\n            increase rural competitiveness and build up rural\n            entrepreneurship in poor rural communities in a sustainable\n            manner through demand-driven partnership schemes with the\n            commercial private sector. This restructuring will provide\n            for: (i) a first 15- months extension of the closing date\n            from September 30, 2013 to December 31, 2014; and (ii) a\n            reallocation of loan proceeds. This extension of the closing\n            date will allow the project to supervise and support the\n            sub-projects approved during 2012 until the end of their\n            implementation. The reallocation of loan proceeds will\n            allocate the funds that prudentially were not allocated at\n            the beginning of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second Rural Productive\n            Partnerships Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Second Rural\n            Productive Partnerships Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/01/20479609/colombia-second-rural-productive-partnerships-project-restructuring","count":"Colombia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, bank account, disbursement,\n            Expenditure, International Bank, LOAN, Loan proceeds,\n            partnership, Rural Development, supervision, Sustainable Development"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","projn":"CO-Second Rural Productive Partnerships\n            Project -- P104567","topic":"Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Rural Finance m1326285 191,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Productivity Enhancing Policy m1326653 1133,Rural Connectivity m1326457 2337","subtopic":"Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Regional Rural Development,Literature & Folklore","docty":"Project Paper","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Culture and Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20141208100159"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural markets","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Culture and Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Rural Finance m1326285 191,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Productivity Enhancing Policy m1326653 1133,Rural Connectivity m1326457 2337","owner":"Agriculture - GP (GFADR)","Environmental Category":["B"],"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"74863"},"16758847":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/09/16758847/colombia-second-rural-productive-partnerships-project-p104567-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-11","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/09/16758847/colombia-second-rural-productive-partnerships-project-p104567-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-11","new_url":"2012/09/16758847/colombia-second-rural-productive-partnerships-project-p104567-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-11","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-09-22T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-09-22T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b08168ce60","chronical_docm_id":"090224b08168ce60","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2012/09/22/5479F1ABCC6C307685257A82000DB2C2/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/ISR0Disclosabl022201201348367377519.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2012/09/22/5479F1ABCC6C307685257A82000DB2C2/1_0/Rendered/PDF/ISR0Disclosabl022201201348367377519.pdf","loan_no":"IBRD74840","datestored":"2012-09-22T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-09-22T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second Rural Productive\n            Partnerships Project : P104567 - Implementation Status\n            Results Report : Sequence 11"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Second Rural\n            Productive Partnerships Project : P104567 - Implementation\n            Status Results Report : Sequence 11"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/09/16758847/colombia-second-rural-productive-partnerships-project-p104567-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-11","projn":"CO-Second Rural Productive Partnerships\n            Project -- P104567","docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report","count":"Colombia","authors":{"authr":"Collion,Marie-Helene"},"entityids":{"entityid":"0000A8056_2012092222293847"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Gen agr/fish/for sec,Central government administration,Trade","theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural markets","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"ISR7746"},"facets":{}}}
