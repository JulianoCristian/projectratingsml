Some lessons learned included:\n            it is important that the Bank understands and serves the\n            client's needs when there has been little previous\n            interaction by preparing upfront capacity building on\n            Bank's processes and procedures. In the context of\n            interrupted engagement, projects should be designed to be\n            modular and requiring less interdependence between\n            components, with a simple design and deliberate and\n            thoughtful preparation. There should be a shortened project\n            horizon rather than components/projects which require a\n            long, steady relationship. When a project is to move quickly\n            because of an emergency situation, arrangements must be made\n            to ensure that project design is kept simple. Future project\n            design should avoid considering a broad range of sectors\n            under the umbrella of a single emergency project. It is more\n            effective to focus projects on specific sectors and\n            activities that are directly related to the immediate\n            reconstruction efforts. Presence of a local office in the\n            country invariably helps resolve issues in a timely manner.\n            The revised guidelines for emergency projects provide\n            flexibility
