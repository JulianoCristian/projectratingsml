Some lessons learned\n            included:  deep reforms changing the patterns of governance\n            and public sector management require adequate preparation,\n            including political economy assessment, consensus building\n            effort and wide political and social ownership. In the\n            absence of such thorough preparation, the likelihood of\n            success is low, irrespective of potentially huge long-run\n            gains for the country and society. In the post-conflict\n            environment, a development policy operation (DPO) instrument\n            can be effective if the reform program is well calibrated to\n            a context of weak technical capacity and multiple\n            priorities. In both countries, and for each operation,\n            ownership of reforms was permanently elusive, and was only\n            assured fleetingly by the lure of arrears clearance or debt\n            relief. Ownership of reforms by respective governments\n            followed a pattern of temporary commitment to reforms for\n            immediate returns. Incentives to governments, leadership and\n            ground conditions lacked for a successful pursuit of the\n            ambitious reform agenda in both counties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo,

In particular, the project will\n            help the country: a) enhance transparency in the oil sector,\n            through the implementation of the action plan, devised after\n            the audit of the accounts of the oil company; b) rationalize\n            public investment, to ensure fiscal discipline, and\n            accountability, and make it more consistent with the\n            pro-poor, and pro-sustainable development goals of the\n            Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP); and, c)\n            reduce domestic arrears in an orderly, and transparent\n            manner. Although risks are significant, these must be\n            balanced with the risks of inaction, which are considerable.\n            Risks stemming from Congo's post-conflict context are\n            being mitigated under a number of International Development\n            Association (IDA) credits. Also, the project would increase\n            the chances of access to the Poverty Reduction and Growth\n            Facility (PRGF) and HIPC, allowing further consolidation of\n            peace. The risk of weak implementation capacity is mitigated\n            by the relatively simple design of the operation, and will\n            be further mitigated by the appointment of a monitoring, and\n            follow-up team in the Ministry of Finance, intensive project\n            supervision, and technical assistance under other IDA credits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Economic Recovery
