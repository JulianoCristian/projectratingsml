Some important project lessons learned were:\n            (1) Implementing improved financial management in local\n            governments is an essential element of improving local\n            governance and oversight but also a complex process that\n            must adapt to shifts in management and technical\n            difficulties. (2) Need to ensure adequate appraisal, quality\n            at entry and documentation of all operations to mitigate\n            risk. (3) Impact of changes in Bank Policy for projects\n            under implementation should be not be underestimated and\n            should be well communicated to the clients. (4) Operating in\n            conflict environments necessitates a high level and\n            creativity of supervision, especially for projects with a\n            reform element. (5) Restructuring should be pro-active,\n            especially in conflict areas, and guidance to task teams\n            should always be clear in this regard. (6) Pay particular\n            attention to capacity equilibrium in the local government system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Local Government\n            Capacity Building
