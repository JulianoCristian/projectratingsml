A legal\n            amendment was made to the Agreement to reflect this change,\n            and to include 36 districts of new UP and 6 districts of UA\n            under the project. The Amendment became effective in August\n            2003. The initial Project Development Objective (PDO) was to\n            assist the Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) in its efforts\n            to build capacity to ensure that all 6-10-year-old children\n            in 42 districts of the (undivided UP) state, particularly\n            those from socially disadvantaged groups, complete a\n            five-year primary education cycle of appropriate quality.\n            Project ratings are as follows : project outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            :Bank performance, satisfactory; borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are : continuity of project staff, especially at state and\n            district levels, is important for the process of project\n            implementation to proceed smoothly; ownership of and\n            interest in the program at all levels of the government is\n            clearly a contributing factor; effective and sustained\n            communication strategies need to be in place to ensure\n            internalization of the reforms planned; a strong M&E\n            set-up is critical for continuous learning and for assessing\n            outcomes; community engagement and support should go beyond\n            mere involvement in developing of the school facility to\n            wider issues related to school management and students'\n            learning; finally, training in financial management\n            functions is important at all levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Uttar Pradesh Third District

complete a five-year\n            primary education cycle of appropriate quality.

The second\n            component institutes a comprehensive teacher development\n            system including revising the curriculum revision, improving\n            teacher materials and modules, developing a continuous\n            learning assessment, and monitoring classroom practices.\n            This component also provides book banks and assesses student\n            learning.
