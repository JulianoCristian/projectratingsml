Some lessons learned included: more\n            narrowly focused operations limit the complexity of\n            implementation for the borrower and supervision breadth for\n            the Bank. In this operation the broad extent of the\n            operation stretched the capacity of government to fully\n            coordinate and execute. It required a substantially\n            increased supervision effort (and funding) by the Bank.\n            While largely successful in this case because of the\n            commitment and capacities on both sides, the question\n            remains whether opportunities for deeper reforms clustered\n            around fewer components were missed. Plugging financing gaps\n            or responding to client requests are frequent factors in\n            Bank operations, but sometimes at the cost of coherence and\n            dispersed efforts. Improving the efficiency, effectiveness,\n            and transparency of government are worthy aspirations but\n            cannot serve as the basis for judging value for money or\n            provide much of an operational guidepost for counterparts,\n            teams, or the Board. When accompanied by sloppily conceived\n            and/or poorly written outcome and intermediate results\n            indicators the burden on client and Bank supervision team is\n            exponentially increased. This is especially ironic in\n            operations which genuinely seek to improve administrative\n            processes, transparency, and better accountability to\n            citizens. It appears in this case, as in many similar\n            projects, that mid-course corrections are inevitable. Hence\n            there should be a presumption on the part of teams and\n            management that restructuring is required. This might help\n            overcome counterpart resistance by lowering any perceived\n            negative public fallout of restructuring, focus the\n            attention of teams earlier on to the specific priorities for\n            adjustment, permit more flexibility in project design if\n            restructuring is viewed as a more acceptable and normal\n            development, help client countries adapt projects to their\n            evolving needs rather than the reverse, and provide more\n            transparency in operations to the Board. Mid-term reviews\n            themselves should be treated by sector and country\n            management as important events (rather than somewhat\n            expanded supervision missions) requiring more active\n            participation of managers or outside donor funded evaluators\n            if feasible. In the case of this operation the mid-term\n            review did lead to important course corrections, but this\n            reflected the strength and commitment of the task teams\n            rather than an institutionalized presumption of the need for change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Public Sector Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Public Sector\n

The project consists o f six\n            components, which in combination will fund key innovations\n            in horizontal management processes and capacity building in\n            specific institutions in the Armenian Public Administration.\n            The ministry and agency-specific interventions aim to have a\n            demonstrative effect and are expected to generate further\n            reforms in other ministries. The components related to\n            horizontal management processes focus on strengthening Civil\n            Service Management, introducing e-Procurement, Financial\n            Oversight by strengthening the Chamber of Control (the\n            supreme audit institution), Policy Management and local\n            level policy implementation. Ministry and Agency specific\n            components focus on the Office o f the Government, the\n            Ministry of Finance and Economy, the Ministry o f Economic\n            Development and Trade and four selected agencies working in\n            the area o f standardization, certification and Metrology.\n            These components assist the government in addressing\n            weaknesses in the policy formulation and implementation\n            process in the central state administration, in particular\n            through the development of electronic document management\n            systems and systems for tracking policy implementation. In\n            addition the project will pilot other public management\n            innovations to enhance transparency and accountability and\n            address priority capacity building needs in selected\n            institutions (the Ministry of Finance and Economy, the\n            Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, and the Office\n            of the
