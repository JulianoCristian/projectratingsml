Some lessons learned included: in a country\n            facing high risks of devaluation, the demand for foreign\n            currency loans by private investors would be limited if they\n            have to bear the foreign exchange risk. In that environment,\n            the investors could be provided with the option of\n            purchasing foreign exchange from Development Finance\n            Institution (DFI) at the market exchange rate. Careful\n            consideration should be given to revising on lending terms\n            of a Bank loan in a timely manner if there are clear\n            indications that the environment for the use of funds is not\n            improving and demand for term loans is sluggish. The Bank\n            leverage on the overall DFI operations is only limited with\n            respect to on lending terms and conditions when funds are\n            available from other sources on soft terms. In this\n            environment, Bank funds bearing tougher terms and conditions\n            would be utilized only when funds from other sources bearing\n            softer terms are used up. Moreover, it is not practical to\n            achieve a positive on lending interest rate under a Bank\n            loan in a financial market which has widespread
