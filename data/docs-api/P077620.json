Financial Management Capacity\n            Building Project (FMCBP)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Financial Management\n            Capacity Building Project (FMCBP) for Lao were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the FMCBP highlights the experience from initially seeking a\n            strong project implementation  unit (PIU) organization\n            structure to compensate for low national capacity to deliver\n            timely outputs to relying on existing capacity for project\n            implementation, perhaps at the expense of expediency. While\n            a strong PIU could deliver some outputs on time, more often\n            than not its staff had to work within the existing low-level\n            capacity environment. This critical factor affected the\n            project implementation across the board. The FMCBP shows\n            that a strong PIU could be effectively used to focus on\n            certain critical areas where strong capacity is needed to\n            bring about timely results. But for a capacity building\n            project in general, it is beneficial to take into account\n            and to work with the country's existing capacity and\n            given environment to best support the capacity building\n            agenda. Due to the need for intensive supervision, a\n            technical assistance project would require adequate funding\n            and staffing to be able to address and manage challenges at\n            the implementation stage, some of which were unexpected and\n            unanticipated. The need for intensive supervision will\n            clearly benefit from the continuing and close presence of\n            the task manager (TM) and the core project team. The TM, in\n            close cooperation with other team members in the field and\n            at headquarters, maintained the implementation momentum for\n            the project through actively coordinating the\n            trouble-shooting activities among Bank staff and government\n            officials for all the challenges and bottlenecks facing the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao - Financial Management Capacity Building\n            Project (FMCBP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lao - Financial Management\n            Capacity Building Project (FMCBP)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15650451/lao-financial-management-capacity-building-project-fmcbp","projn":"LA-Financial Management Capacity Building\n            Credit -- P077620","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Contract Law,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120123010202"},"subsc":"Banking,General industry and trade sector,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Apr, Back-up, Capacity Building, Competitive\n            Bidding, Computer Network, Computers, Debt, Digital Cameras,\n            Finance Management, Financial Management, Financial\n            Management Capacity, Flash, Hard Drive, LAN, Local Area\n            Network, prior agreement, Procurement, Procurement Plan,\n            Public Finance, Server, Technical requirement, Telephone,\n            Treasury, value of Goods"}},"owner":"Knowledge and Information Servs. (IMTKI)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF057139-PHRD: LAO PDR - FINANCIAL\n            MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING CREDIT","repnb":"ICR1681"},"12701565":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/08/12701565/lao-pdr-financial-management-capacity-building-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2010/08/12701565/lao-pdr-financial-management-capacity-building-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","new_url":"2010/08/12701565/lao-pdr-financial-management-capacity-building-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","disclosure_date":"2010-08-26T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/08/26/000356161_20100826233345/Rendered/INDEX/563360PJPR0P081ructuring0Data0sheet.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2010/08/26/000356161_20100826233345/Rendered/PDF/563360PJPR0P081ructuring0Data0sheet.pdf","credit_no":"3676;H316","datestored":"2010-08-26T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2010-08-04T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"Lao PDR - Financial Management Capacity\n            Building Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Financial\n            Management Capacity Building Project is to improve the\n            Government of Lao PDR (GOL) budget preparation, execution,\n            reporting and auditing systems; strengthen monitoring of\n            state owned commercial bank operations, and to improve\n            financial management of selected state owned enterprises.\n            The reallocation is necessary to mainly support the\n            increasing requirements for budget training and procurement\n            of consultants to carry out fiscal and budget works.
