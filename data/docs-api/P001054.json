The project\n            achieved all of its major objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was highly satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, it would be more appropriate, in situations\n            such as Guinea's in 1980, to begin by addressing the\n            sector in its entirety by means of adjustment or sector-wide\n            investment operations with strong capacity-building\n            components. Second, the question of whether cost recovery\n            affects the accessibility of the poor to health services\n            should be further addressed. Third, specific quality control\n            measures and surveys should be carried out regularly to\n            further improve utilization rates and health services\n            outcomes. Fourth, weak family planning outcomes show that\n            strong, high-level political support and a convincing effort\n            to sensitize the target are needed from the start of the\n            project. Proper primary health services are also needed to\n            boost the demand for modern contraception. Finally,\n            community-based activities should be developed, together\n            with more general policy consensus processes, from the very\n            beginning of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -
