Hopes for reconciliation and a renewal\n            of government have not materialized despite the Fomboni\n            Agreement reached in February 2001 to end political turmoil\n            and which outlined the path to reunification and\n            democratization of the country. However, new lines of\n            confrontation emerged as the agreements had left room for\n            interpretation and negotiation on the specific\n            responsibilities and prerogatives of the four governments\n            (the Union and three islands pressing for autonomy). Since\n            July 2002 disagreements over budget issues emerged,\n            particularly with respect to modalities of tax collection\n            and customs administration. Disputes over control of\n            revenues and the security forces, and mutual accusations of\n            coup and assassination plots have charged the atmosphere\n            further, and caused indefinite postponement of legislative\n            elections for the Union and the three islands. The tensions\n            between the Union and the islands are further compounded\n            because Anjouan has been operating much like an independent\n            entity, while Moheli and Grande Comore have never been able\n            to fully exercise their autonomous prerogatives. Comoros is\n            not a war-torn, post-conflict country recovering from heavy\n            loss of human or physical capital. But unconventional\n            business practices have flourished in an institutional\n            vacuum and poor governance, as evidenced by the\n            single-source contracting for the country's telephone\n            code, by Anjouan's \"double privatization\" of\n            its port, and by the lack of competitive practices for oil\n            or rice imports. The setting-up of the Union and of the\n            three independent islands was not properly prepared and\n            to-date there is a significant lack of understanding as to\n            the roles and responsibilities of the different spheres of\n            government. This report points out the barriers to project\n            completion as the islands' preoccupation with autonomy\n            and unwillingness to accept Union oversight in any of their\n            development efforts; the failure of the road fund to\n            preserve investments and release resources; and the\n            criticism of the role of the international expert who\n            managed the project unit. The report suggests focusing\n            development assistance on communities and civil society in\n            situations where a functioning government is absent and\n            mutual distrust exists among political leaders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros -

The primary program\n            objective is to improve living conditions and stimulate\n            economic growth in the Comoros, while protecting the\n            environment through investments in basic infrastructure.\n            There are three project components.

The\n            urban water supply component will support the rehabilitation\n            and extension of urban water infrastructure, and support\n            technical assistance to strengthen the management and\n            operation of urban water utilities. The third component\n            funds agency coordination and supports training on\n            environmental management for government staff and others who\n            design, implement, maintain,

Nonetheless, it is expected that environmental\n            adversity will occur as a result of project implementation,\n            namely due to construction, and rehabilitation works.\n            Mitigating measures are: 1) Establishment of waste disposal\n            sites, and retention schemes to drain water flows, under\n            strict bacteriological quality testing of waters, to protect\n            aquatic marine bio-diversity. Sewers should be covered, to\n            facilitate road functionality. 2) Hydro-biological studies\n            should address watershed management, particularly regarding\n            water supply distribution; and, regarding the construction\n            of water supply systems, protection walls should be built to\n            avoid contamination, in addition to including precautionary\n            clauses in the bidding documents. Engineering design will\n            limit deforestation, and loss of agricultural land. However,\n            potential agricultural losses include compensation, or\n            resettlement to new lands of equal agricultural value,\n            including new seedlings for lost fruits, and vegetables,\n            accompanied by compensation for the length of time those\n            seedlings remain unproductive. 3) Roads, and infrastructure\n            works will require limited working hours, to abate noise and\n            air pollution, including spraying to avoid dust pollution.\n            Safety measures include road signaling, and an awareness\n            campaign to inform the communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Infrastructure, Water and\n            Environment Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comores \u2013 Projet infrastructure,\n            eau et environnement : \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/12/692999/comoros-infrastructure-water-environment-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"KM-Infrast, Water & Env Prj (Fy01) -- P047250","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Comoros","authors":{"authr":"SCETAUROUTE"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00102005304296"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Roads and highways,Water supply,Central government administration","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Infrastructure\n            development projects; Urban development; Water supply\n            systems; Transport infrastructure; Construction works; Waste\n            disposal sites; Waste disposal in the ocean; Drainage\n            systems; Bacteriological examination; Marine conservation;\n            Aquatic ecoystems; Biodiversity conservation; Sewerage;\n            Biological treatment; Studies; Watershed management; Water\n            supply engineering; Precautionary principle; Bidding\n            documents; Engineering design; Deforestation; Agricultural\n            land settlement; Compensation; Resettlement allowances;\n            Seedlings; Noise abatement; Air pollution control; Spraying;\n            Road safety measures; Road signs & signals; Public awareness"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF023976-FAC CONSULTANT TRUST FUND (USD A/C),TF027002-PHRD-INFRASTRUCTURE, WATER\n            & ENVIRONMENT PROJ.","repnb":"E388"},"facets":{}}}
