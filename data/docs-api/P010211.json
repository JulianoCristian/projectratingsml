The project achieved most of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was modest,\n            sustainability is uncertain at this time, and both the Bank\n            and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, adequate long term\n            measures, both institutional and financial, should be built\n            into the design of projects. Second, more attention needs to\n            be given to raising both general awareness and technical\n            capability of lower level technicians in the area of water\n            management. Third, more attention should be given to\n            agricultural extension services and marketing. Fourth, O\n            & M of irrigation systems cannot be carried out by\n            farmers alone. It requires skilled inputs from technical\n            personnel as well as adequate funding. Fifth, it is\n            necessary to improve farmers' incomes through crop\n            diversification in the yala season where possible. Lastly,\n            farmer organizations undertaking construction activities is\n            a good concept. However, they should be protected against\n            major price fluctuations in materials to enable them to\n            carry out work without delay."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Major Irrigation Rehabiltation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Major Irrigation\n            Rehabiltation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/733802/sri-lanka-major-irrigation-rehabiltation-project","projn":"LK-Irrig.
