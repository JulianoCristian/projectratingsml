The lessons learned indicate that a limited\n            scope and a short implementation span are ideal to approach\n            transitional situations, such as that encountered in Yemen\n            at the onset of this project, in which the government had\n            been reluctant to focus on policy and reform aspects of the\n            sector as a whole in the past. When acute scarcity is the\n            main sector issue, it is best to avoid fragmentation of\n            instruments and to address issues of long-term\n            sustainability of water resource management together with\n            issues of urban supply of water and sanitation. Thinking\n            strategically throughout project implementation is critical\n            to secure better outcomes. In this case, the earlier\n            implementation of the strategic study included in the water\n            resources component could have provided valuable insights\n            for the preparation of the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project (UWSSP) and the Sana'a Basin Water Resources\n            Management Project. When planning a private transaction in a\n            risky country, establishing at the onset an adequate\n            fall-back option might prove critical to the overall success\n            of the approach. Contracting out the establishment of house\n            connections to the private sector is, generally speaking, a\n            good idea and should be encouraged in most situations.\n            Supervision from the field is helpful when institutional\n            capacity is scarce. Having the task management in the field\n            during supervision was helpful in the early identification\n            of implementation issues, such as the design problems with\n            the wastewater treatment plant, and monitoring of the\n            implementation of the environment mitigation plan. It is\n            important to set realistic objectives, especially in areas -\n            such as cost recovery and reduction of losses - which are\n            known for requiring major managerial change before results\n            can improve. In order to better guide design and supervision\n            decisions, outcome indicators should be defined as closely\n            as possible to direct measures of impact on beneficiaries,\n            e.g., consistency of water supply and increase on the\n            overall population served, rather than mileage of network\n            rehabilitated. Outcome indicators and monitoring and\n            evaluation efforts are useless without a solid initial\n            baseline. Levels of UFW constitute a standard and quite\n            acceptable indicator in water operations. In this case,\n            however, the limited scope of the intervention, coupled with\n            the absence of a credible baseline, meant that the indicator\n            would remain marginally significant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen, Republic of - Sana'A Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen, Republic of - Sana'A\n            Water

rehabilitation of existing\n            wellfields, and the provision of bulk meters. 2) Water\n            supply and distribution will support leak detection,\n            rehabilitation of tertiary networks and house connections\n            characterized by high unaccounted for water, and network\n            improvements. 3) Sewerage will finance emergency sewer\n            network installations, including an urgently needed\n            extension of the sewer trunk main. 4) Technical assistance\n            and institution capacity building will support establishment\n            of an autonomous Sana'a Branch, incremental operating\n            expenditures, construction supervision, technical assistance\n            and studies to support sector reform, and computer\n

Although no major\n            environmental issues are envisaged, since there is no land\n            acquisition to force involuntary resettlements; nor is there\n            any indigenous people or cultural heritage issues, there are\n            nonetheless, environmental aspects to consider, such as: 1)\n            cesspit removal and sewage disposal during construction; 2)\n            disposition of dried sewage sludge; and, 3) handling of\n            chemicals flushed into water lines. Mitigation measures call\n            for the prevention of public access to the site during\n            construction. Initially liquid wastes will be transported\n            to, and disposed into the existing wastewater treatment\n            plant pond at off-peak hours, and coliform levels will be\n            monitored. Regarding the dried sewage sludge, even though\n            dried sludge is already being sold for compost purposes, a\n            formal policy will be developed as part of the environmental\n            mitigation component of the project. The disposal of\n            hazardous chemicals will be, partly, the responsibility of\n            the contractor in training workers on handling such\n            chemicals, as well as providing safety gear. In addition, a\n            contingency plan, will specify counter-control measures and\n            spill prevention. Abatement of noise and air pollution,\n            public awareness and consultation processes are also included."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Sana'a Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Sana'a Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/03/441024/yemen-sanaa-water-supply-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"RY-Sana'A Ws/Sanitation -- P005907","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Sanitation and Sewerage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water and Industry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Yemen, Republic of","authors":{"authr":"Shair & Partners"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99060411070038"},"subsc":"Water supply,Central government administration,Sewerage,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Aeration,chemical treatment,Collection\n            System,community leaders,compost,construction,Cost of\n            Water,Disinfection,environmental consequences,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Laws,Environmental\n            Legislation,environmental management,Environmental\n            Protection,gas,Groundwater,heavy\n            equipment,households,inspection chambers,Leak\n            detection,Manholes,moisture content,oversight\n            role,pipes,Pollution,pond,ponds,Population\n            Density,Population Distribution,public health,raw\n            sewage,regulatory requirements,Sanitation,SANITATION\n            AUTHORITY,Sanitation Sector,Sanitation\n            Services,screens,Service Provision,Sewage Disposal,sewage\n            network,sewage sludge,sewer system,Sewerage,Sewerage\n            Network,sewerage system,Soils,storm\n            drainage,town,Treaties,Urban Area,Urban Growth,waste,Waste\n            Disposal,wastes,wastewater,wastewater services,wastewater\n            treatment,wastewater treatment plant,wastewaters,Water\n            Resources,Water storage,Water Supply,Water Supply\n            Rehabilitation,Water Supply System,water system,Water Use,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"Aeration,chemical treatment,Collection\n            System,community leaders,compost,construction,Cost of\n            Water,Disinfection,environmental consequences,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT,environmental\n            issues,Environmental Laws,Environmental\n            Legislation,environmental management,Environmental\n            Protection,gas,Groundwater,heavy\n            equipment,households,inspection chambers,Leak\n            detection,Manholes,moisture content,oversight\n            role,pipes,Pollution,pond,ponds,Population\n            Density,Population Distribution,public health,raw\n            sewage,regulatory requirements,Sanitation,SANITATION\n            AUTHORITY,Sanitation Sector,Sanitation\n            Services,screens,Service Provision,Sewage Disposal,sewage\n            network,sewage sludge,sewer system,Sewerage,Sewerage\n            Network,sewerage system,Soils,storm\n            drainage,town,Treaties,Urban Area,Urban Growth,waste,Waste\n            Disposal,wastes,wastewater,wastewater services,wastewater\n            treatment,wastewater treatment plant,wastewaters,Water\n            Resources,Water storage,Water Supply,Water Supply\n            Rehabilitation,Water Supply System,water system,Water Use,wells"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF039389-MIDDLE EAST AND PACIFIC -\n            SEWERAGE (IRAN, YEMAN, LEBANON),TF037562-YEMEN - SANA'A WATER\n            SUPPLY & SANITATION,TF037105-YEMEN - SANA'A WATER\n            SUPPLY AND SANITATION,TF037104-YEMEN - SANA'A WATER\n            SUPPLY AND SANITATION,TF037102-YEMEN - SANA'S WS.,\n            NAT'L COM.
