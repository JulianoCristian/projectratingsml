The objectives of the project were to: (a) provide\n            additional education facilities through the construction of\n            420 classrooms, provision of school equipment and materials,\n            and training of teachers; (b) support agricultural\n            production with seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, feedstuffs,\n            veterinary products, equipment, spare parts, and flood\n            control materials (gabions); (c) procure equipment,\n            materials and training for labor intensive construction of\n            410 km secondary and feeder roads; and (d) prepare 2,500\n            serviced sites for housing construction by returnees.\n            Bank's performance was not satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was not satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (1) there should be\n            specific plan of coordination between Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) and Project Implementation Units (PIU) especially\n            in a multi sector project like ERP; (ii) to award the PIU\u2019s\n            the complete facilities as an independent unit, to enable\n            the proper execution of its tasks rather than attaching the\n            PIU's under direct dealings with the Ministers as it\n            happened in ERP; (iii) provision of adequate counterpart\n            budget without any delay for smooth execution of the\n            projects activities (iv) pre co-ordination with water,\n            Drainage services sector before the commencement of any\n            housing complex, to facilitate its proper execution; (v)\n            good project preparation and strong support from the\n            concerned authorities in the government; and (vi) continuous\n
