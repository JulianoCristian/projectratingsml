Some lessons learned included:\n            Federal states involve complex relationships and governance\n            issues in terms of sub-national collaboration. Therefore,\n            projects require greater supervision and coordination for\n            successful implementation. The complexity associated with\n            procurement processes for goods and services differed\n            significantly between the provinces and the capital of the\n            country. The distance between the provinces and the capital\n            is a significant factor that must be considered before\n            procurement processes are started. This project faced many\n            problems because the more remote areas in the provinces lack\n            equipment providers, therefore equipment purchases had to be\n            done in Buenos Aires. In order to avoid unnecessary delays\n            and to promote institutional strengthening, projects should\n            create financial and procurement capacities in their own\n            agencies. Monitoring and evaluation processes cannot be a\n            'paper' process overlooked during the\n            project's design stage. They should be utilized\n            primarily as a means to provide feedback and understanding\n            to project participants during the entire project cycle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

The three\n            main components will: 1) improve preparedness, and\n            responsiveness to maritime pollution, and oil spills, and,\n            prevent ship-based pollution, through: a) improved analysis\n            of contingency plans, using modern technology for database\n            organization; b) extensive training in oil spill mitigation,\n            and, in oil spill trajectory modeling; and, c) improved\n            enforcement of the International Convention for the\n            Prevention of Pollution from Ships regulations. Navigational\n            risks will be reduced by introducing a marine electronic\n            infrastructure program, through an enhanced vessel tracking\n            system, and implementation of hydrographic mapping of\n            critical zones; 2) improve knowledge base, and identify\n            ecologically sensitive areas of marine biodiversity, by\n            targeting programs to understand the dynamics of ocean\n            production, and environmental degradation of the Patagonian\n            ecosystem, including trans-boundary analysis to complete\n            ecological identification, and inter-calibration of key\n            marine laboratories. Marine protection tools will be\n            developed, through analyses of regulatory, and technical\n            aspects to pilot marine reserves, and, an action program\n            will be developed based on the evaluation of incidental\n            catch of birds, or mammals; and, 3) support capacity\n            building, and dissemination practices on marine biodiversity\n            protection, including monitoring and evaluation, and project management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
