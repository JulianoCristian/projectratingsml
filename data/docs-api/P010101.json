The co financiers\n            supervised the project regularly, and maintained excellent\n            relations with the Government of Sri Lanka. The main lessons\n            have been to: (i) carry out surveys and detailed designs and\n            plan the construction of works adequately in advance to\n            avoid implementation delays; (ii) allow sufficient time for\n            construction in view of the limited time during which canals\n            can be closed; (iii) prevent indiscriminate land and water\n            use in the catchment areas which reduces inflow to the tanks\n            and increases erosion; (iv) build confidence among farmers\n            that water will arrive on time and will be distributed\n            equitably; and (v) assure farmers that changes in cropping\n            practices they are expected to make will get the necessary\n            support from the agencies concerned. Although the warning\n            has been sounded earlier, it is worth repeating here that\n            the level and quality of support services provided to\n            farmers may well determine the success of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Tank Irrigation Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Tank Irrigation\n            Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/12/740970/sri-lanka-tank-irrigation-modernization-project","projn":"LK-Tank Irr.
