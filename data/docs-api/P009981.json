Lessons\n            learned from the project are: 1) a free market is a\n            requisite for the rapid growth of an industry. In a\n            developing country, however, the government has to actively\n            support the transition from a command economy to a free\n            economy; 2) to be competitive and efficient and to have\n            staying power, the industry must possess and continuously\n            upgrade its technical and management skills and knowledge;\n            3) any technology that is introduced in a developing country\n            should have proven track record. Initial price attractions\n            of unproved technology could be ultimately detrimental; 4)\n            in planning projects, a holistic approach that should\n            include what external agencies should provide is necessary.\n            Power, transportation, access roads and other items, in\n            regard to their availability and dependability have to be\n            assessed and built in at the start; and 5) in the present\n            context of high interest rates on loans in India, attention\n            should be paid to the capital structure so that the debt to\n            equity ratios are carefully determined at start of a\n            project. The project costs could become high due to interest\n            during construction and delays in commissioning could have a\n            deleterious effect on the finances of a project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Fourth, the project will\n            assist DCCI in studying policy and strategic options for\n            mini cement sector, coal washing, use of lignite, pollution\n            control and environmental protection for the cement\n            industry, and further development of bulk cement transport\n            and applications."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Cement Industry Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Cement Industry\n            Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/04/738180/india-cement-industry-restructuring-project","projn":"IN-Cement Industry Rest -- P009981","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Construction Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Roads & Highways,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Transport","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928210929"},"subsc":"(Historic)Industrial restructuring","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ash,Audits,Bank Lending,Book value,capital\n            employed,capital formation,Cement,Cement Industry,CEMENT\n            MANUFACTURING,cement plants,Cement\n            Production,coal,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,concrete,concrete\n            roads,construction industry,consumers,controlled\n            prices,deposits,developed countries,devolution,economic\n            efficiency,economies of scale,elasticity,environmental\n            protection,equalization,exchange rate,expected\n            return,Financial Institutions,financial\n            performance,Financial Restructuring,Fog,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,GNP per Capita,grade,growth\n            rate,houses,housing,imports,income,interest rate,labor\n            force,limestone,loading,local governments,market\n            competition,mines,Monopolies,net worth,oil,Ownership\n            Structure,Policy Environment,Pollution,Pollution\n            Control,Portland Cement,ports,power plants,private\n            consumption,private housing,producers,production\n            costs,production technology,productivity,profit\n            margin,profitability,public housing,quotas,Reserve Bank of\n            India,return on investment,sales taxes,savings,Shadow\n            Prices,Slag,Steel,Technical Assistance,Transport"},"1":{"cdata!":"ash,Audits,Bank Lending,Book value,capital\n            employed,capital formation,Cement,Cement Industry,CEMENT\n            MANUFACTURING,cement plants,Cement\n            Production,coal,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,concrete,concrete\n            roads,construction industry,consumers,controlled\n            prices,deposits,developed countries,devolution,economic\n            efficiency,economies of scale,elasticity,environmental\n            protection,equalization,exchange rate,expected\n            return,Financial Institutions,financial\n            performance,Financial Restructuring,Fog,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,GNP per Capita,grade,growth\n            rate,houses,housing,imports,income,interest rate,labor\n            force,limestone,loading,local governments,market\n            competition,mines,Monopolies,net worth,oil,Ownership\n            Structure,Policy Environment,Pollution,Pollution\n            Control,Portland Cement,ports,power plants,private\n            consumption,private housing,producers,production\n            costs,production technology,productivity,profit\n            margin,profitability,public housing,quotas,Reserve Bank of\n            India,return on investment,sales taxes,savings,Shadow\n            Prices,Slag,Steel,Technical Assistance,Transport"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"8422"},"facets":{}}}
