outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: due diligence\n            in respect to safeguards should involve close monitoring of\n            changing conditions on the ground, especially where there\n            has been a considerable time lag between initial collection\n            of baseline data and final preparation of safeguards\n            documents. The Bank and Borrowers should ensure careful\n            cross-sectoral coordination, internally and externally, as\n            early as possible during project design to avoid potentially\n            conflicting designs and or siting of investments. There are\n            trade-offs between strengthening the institutional capacity\n            of implementing agencies through learning by doing\n            approaches while at the same time holding them accountable\n            for implementing critical project activities, and associated\n            risks to implementation progress and quality should be duly\n            recognized and adequately mitigated. Design of project\n            implementation schedules should ensure that sufficient time\n            is given to the implementation of software activities in\n            order to reap the full benefits. For infrastructure\n            investments and services targeting the poor, it is not\n            uncommon to continue to require in the short-to medium-term\n            some form of cross-subsidy among beneficiary groups and or\n            continued support from central or local governments from\n            revenues other than direct user fees to ensure service\n            delivery on a sustainable basis. Adequate resources should\n            be allocated for critical monitoring and evaluation (M and\n            E) activities such as Beneficiary Assessment (BAs), and\n            these activities included as deliverables in procurement\n            plans to allow for completion of data collection and\n            analysis of project outcomes before the closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana
