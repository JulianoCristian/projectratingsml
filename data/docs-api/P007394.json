The specific objectives were to help Government\n            of Honduras (GOH) to sustain its poverty alleviation efforts\n            and maintain social cohesion during the period of economic\n            adjustment, while the line ministries strengthened their\n            institutional capacities and completed policy reform\n            programs, building upon the achievements. The Second\n            Honduras Social Investment Fund (FFHS II) mandate was to\n            serve as the implementing arm of the line ministries in the\n            management and financing of priority small and medium-scale\n            social and economic infrastructure subprojects, as well as\n            to fund priority programs in basic needs. Some main lessons\n            learned are that: (a) Bank supervision should be intensified\n            during election years, and following a change in\n            implementing agency management, especially when management\n            changes are related to a change in government\n            administration; and (b) the Bank and the implementing agency\n            should agree on detailed, practical key performance and\n            impact indicators which the project entity and the Bank will\n            use to monitor and evaluate the achievement of project\n            objectives, while recognizing that the implementing agency\n            may use other indicators for its own purposes. The Bank\n            should also pay more attention to the information technology\n            aspects of the monitoring and evaluation system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Second Social

alleviation efforts and maintain social cohesion while the\n            line ministries strengthen their institutional capacities\n            and complete their reform programs. The credit will finance\n            a range of small-scale subprojects in four broad categories:\n            (a) social infrastructure; (b) economic infrastructure; (c)\n            social services; and (d) credit to small informal sector\n            entrepreneurs. Wherever feasible, the subprojects will be\n            carried out by small private contractors using\n            labor-intensive methods.  The credit will also provide\n            institutional support through technical assistance to the\n            Honduran Social Investment Fund.  Finally, the credit will\n            provide technical assistance to the Nongovernmental\n            Organization Liaison Office, to strengthen the partnership\n            between the public sector and nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs) in addressing poverty problems, and to promote\n            NGOs' role in the preparation of subprojects in poorer\n            communities, so that the poor can actually take advantage of\n            all funds targeted on them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Second Social Investment Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Second Social\n            Investment Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/05/736813/honduras-second-social-investment-fund-project","projn":"HN-Soc Inv Fund II -- P007394","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,National Governance,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Honduras","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961002215847"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative costs,agricultural\n            sector,audits,authorization,banking system,cost\n            recovery,disposable income,donor community,economic\n            growth,employment,exchange rate,executing\n            agencies,expenditures,external auditors,families,financial\n            support,FISCAL,fiscal deficit,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,Government agencies,Gross National\n            Product,illiteracy,income,inflation,informal\n            sector,legislation,living standard,Living Standards,Living\n            Standards Measurement,malnutrition,management information\n            systems,mortality,mothers,municipalities,Nations,nutrition,operating\n            costs,partnership,poor communities,poverty\n            alleviation,poverty criteria,poverty issues,poverty\n            map,Presidency,primary education,primary school,primary\n            schools,private sector,public investment,public\n            sector,public utilities,recurrent\n            expenditures,rehabilitation,rural areas,rural\n            communities,safety,safety net,schools,social cost,social\n            infrastructure,social sector,social services,social\n            support,Structural Adjustment,Subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,transport,unemployment,urban\n            poverty,vitamins,vulnerable groups,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative costs,agricultural\n            sector,audits,authorization,banking system,cost\n            recovery,disposable income,donor community,economic\n            growth,employment,exchange rate,executing\n            agencies,expenditures,external auditors,families,financial\n            support,FISCAL,fiscal deficit,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,Government agencies,Gross National\n            Product,illiteracy,income,inflation,informal\n            sector,legislation,living standard,Living Standards,Living\n            Standards Measurement,malnutrition,management information\n            systems,mortality,mothers,municipalities,Nations,nutrition,operating\n            costs,partnership,poor communities,poverty\n            alleviation,poverty criteria,poverty issues,poverty\n            map,Presidency,primary education,primary school,primary\n            schools,private sector,public investment,public\n            sector,public utilities,recurrent\n            expenditures,rehabilitation,rural areas,rural\n            communities,safety,safety net,schools,social cost,social\n            infrastructure,social sector,social services,social\n            support,Structural Adjustment,Subsidiary,technical\n            assistance,transport,unemployment,urban\n            poverty,vitamins,vulnerable groups,workers"}},"owner":"Human Development (LCSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"repnb":"P5746"},"facets":{}}}
