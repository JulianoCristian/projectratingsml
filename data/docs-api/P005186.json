Dez Irrigation Project : completion report"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Government of Iran requested in the\n            late 1950s a loan from the Bank for the development of the\n            Khuzestan area in the southwest of Iran. The Dez irrigation\n            area is located in the upper Khuzestan on both banks of the\n            Dez river, about 120 kilometer (km) north of Ahwaz and has\n            about 125,000 hectares of irrigable land. Land leveling and\n            the re-alignment, improvement and construction of farm\n            irrigation channels, which were to be the responsibility of\n            the land owners with technical assistance provided by\n            consultants under the project, were delayed due to changes\n            brought about by the land reform program in the 1960s. The\n            next phase in the development of the project area, which\n            came to be called stage one, included the construction of a\n            re-regulating dam and a diversion dam near Dezful with\n            canals, drains, irrigation distribution systems, flood\n            protection works, and maintenance roads to serve an\n            additional 37,000 hectares. In early 1972, the Bank\n            appraised what was called stage two of the total project\n            area. This was envisaged as a project to provide irrigation\n            to the remaining 27,000 hectares not covered under other\n            projects, thus fully utilizing the irrigation water\n            resources of the Pahlavi dam. In 1972 the International\n            Finance Corporation approved a loan of United States (U.S.)\n            l. 25 million dollars for one of the agribusinesses involved\n            in the project area. The agribusinesses in the project area\n            were partly financed later on with Bank funds through two of\n            the three loans to what came to be called the Agricultural\n            Development Bank of Iran. This project completion report\n            relates specifically to Loan 594-IRN which helped finance\n            stage one. This report makes extensive reference to all\n            aspects in its effort to comprehend the results of\n            irrigation development in the Khuzestan area."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Dez

During its appraisal\n            of the project the Bank concluded that there were serious\n            doubts about the justification of the irrigation portion of\n            the project and finally agreed with the Government to\n            finance only the Dez Pilot Irrigation Project (DPIP) of\n            20,000 hectares. This was included in Loan 247-IRN, male in\n            1960. The intention in financing only the DPIP was to test\n            on a relatively small scale, before proceeding to consider ~\n            larger investment, the capacity of the Government, the\n            landowners and the tenant farmers to solve the\n            organizational, administrative and technical problems\n            involved in transforming a very backward area to achieve\n            agricultural production at the level .needed to justify the\n            cost of development. The measures required to overcome the\n            problems had never before been introduced nor even attempted\n            in Iran. This paper examines the measures applied, assesses\n            their effectiveness and describes, in relation to the\n            experience of the DPIP, some additional measures on the\n            application of-which the Bank has now obtained assurances\n            from the Government for the new loan for the construction of\n            the first phase (stage one) of the larger development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran, Islamic Republic of -
