Lack of\n            effective financial management, audit and procurement\n            functions in the public sector continued to hamper the\n            government's ability to function effectively. The\n            Financial Management Transparency and Accountability Project\n            (FIMTAP) was designed to provide a toolkit of solutions to\n            poor fiscal discipline, transparency, accountability and\n            operational inefficiency in the public service. The project\n            introduced new payroll and human resource management and\n            debt management systems. An effective Integrated Financial\n            Management Information System was linked to the budget\n            development system, to streamline budget and cost estimates.\n            All government bank accounts was consolidated into a\n            Treasury Single Account, to better control public debt\n            management, and provide control over the public wage bill."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -

Some lessons learned\n            included: the project design should be simple and designed\n            for easy implementation and should take into account the\n            absorptive capacity of the country and the prevailing\n            political context. For efficient use of available resources\n            in a country, project design should take account of grant\n            financing from donors, which however, requires more flexible\n            design of capacity building activities. This will minimize\n            duplication of efforts, and encourage cost effectiveness.\n            Changes in political economy are not predictable, but could\n            be better adapted to if project design allowed greater\n            flexibility in implementation. It is pertinent therefore, to\n            constantly evaluate and adapt to change in circumstances to\n            better maneuver public management reform programs.\n            Candidness in project supervision reporting is essential, as\n            is early management attention to emerging problems. A\n            project should not proceed with Board presentation unless a\n            full technical appraisal and feasibility study of its\n            components have been conducted. Inter-ministerial and donor\n            coordination is crucial to the success of project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Financial Management, Transparency,\n            and
