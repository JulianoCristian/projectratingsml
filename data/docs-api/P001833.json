While the project succeeded in establishing\n            the PCAs, it was inconsistent over time in its approach to\n            the organizations. As a result, the PCAs have not developed\n            a clear role and consequent visibility, either locally or\n            nationally, and risk becoming insignificant. Given the\n            marginality of pastoral livestock producers and their need\n            to integrate into the larger economy, this is increasing\n            frustration and could undercut other efforts, including\n            those of successor projects, unless the lessons learned from\n            the project's efforts to support pastoralists are\n            heeded. First, instead of a misplaced emphasis on resource\n            management systems that attempts to devise and introduce\n            improved technologies, priority should be given to actions\n            that will help the pastoralists better integrate into the\n            larger economy and society. Second future projects should\n            consider actions that will foster the growth of a broader\n            pattern of local leadership in the communities, actions\n            providing an enabling environment for new initiatives and\n            the emergence of new cooperative groupings. Third when\n            strong local structures for development-oriented activities\n            do not exist, a sequenced and process approach to project\n            operations is required."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania -
