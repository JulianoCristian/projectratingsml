Some lessons learned included: the\n            formulation or amendment of laws is a political process\n            where the Bank can only have a limited influence and will\n            essentially be governed by local politics. This is true even\n            when the government recognizes the need for legal\n            amendments, but reforms might be opposed by a number of\n            interest groups that rely on the status quo to maintain\n            their position. A project implementation unit (PIU) with\n            substantial decision making power helps project\n            implementation when the responsible Ministry is challenged\n            due to frequent changes at the top. Countries that have\n            reasonably functional land use and cadaster maps as well as\n            building regulations and permit requirement need significant\n            amounts of time and coordination efforts to get permits and\n            documentation approved and verified by the competent\n            authorities before works can commence. The flexibility in\n            approach to accommodate parallel financing on site selection\n            and responding to farmers needs based on current activities\n            with electrification rather than strictly pushing the\n            project design helps in achieving concrete on the ground results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia -
