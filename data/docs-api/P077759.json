As a result of Hurricane Ivan,\n            more than 80 percent of the building structures on the\n            island sustained some form of damage, including 90 percent\n            of the housing stock. The damage caused to schools was only\n            second to the damage in the housing sector.  Out of the 58\n            primary public schools, 25 suffered major structural damage\n            or destruction.

This objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing\n            equitable access to secondary education; (ii) improving the\n            quality o f the teaching and learning process, with more\n            direct interventions and provision of resources at the\n            school level, a focus on student-centered learning and\n            various mechanisms to provide student support; and (iii)\n            strengthening management o f the sector and governance of\n            schools. In Grenada, special emphasis will be placed on\n            improving students' literacy and numeracy skills. There\n            are three main components. Component 1 expands and\n            rehabilitates existing secondary schools. Component 2\n            improves the quality of teaching and learning by developing\n            curricula for Forms I to III, upgrading teacher skills,\n            improving the student assessment system, and improving\n            student support services. Component 3 strengthens governance\n            and management by strengthening school supervision and\n            management, establishing an educational management\n            information system,
