Some\n            lessons learned included: getting the system's\n            structure and technical content right was a process that\n            took time and involved some trial and error. The ministry of\n            labor's (MoL's) commitment to learning and\n            improving before scaling up was a key factor to success, and\n            contributed to the strong results for project activities.\n            Employment and training policy became a priority given the\n            resumption of economic growth, employment creation, and\n            improved fiscal performance after the decline of\n            competiveness during the 1990's and the economic crisis\n            of 2001-02. Without the recognition of the training program\n            as part of government's policy to improve the\n            employability and employment outcomes of low skilled and\n            unemployed workers, it is unlikely that an effort of the\n            current magnitude will have emerged (as is the case in most\n            countries where efforts to cover vulnerable populations tend\n            to resemble a patchwork of projects rather than a structured\n            program). To sustain the interest of industry and employers,\n            the MOL worked with sector councils to ensure they had\n            flexibility to tailor training programs to fit industry\n            needs (that is, course duration, training length, trainer\n            profile, training location, etc.) while meeting overall\n            competency-based training and certification standards.\n            Implementing a competency-based training and certification\n            system that truly reflects industry demands is a complex\n            task that requires working with a multiplicity of sectors\n            and many stakeholders within each sector. The output based\n            disbursement mechanism proved effective for financing agreed\n            outputs that the MoL decided to move the payments for\n            evaluation and certification services to disbursement modality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Lifelong Learning and Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Lifelong Learning and\n            Training

supporting the Government of Argentina to consolidate,\n            strengthen, and increase the coverage of a lifelong learning\n            and competency-based training system for disadvantaged\n            adults 18 years or older with the objectives for those who\n            participate to: (i) enhance employability (for unemployed);\n            and (ii) improve career opportunities (for employed). As of\n            August 15, 2012, the loan has disbursed nearly US$170\n            million or about 80 percent of total proceeds. Overall\n            progress in project implementation is good. The targets set\n            for some indicators such as the number of trained and\n            evaluated workers have already been exceeded. The\n            reallocation is necessary primarily to reflect some changes\n            in the administrative procedures associated with project\n            implementation. The method of contracting the orientation\n            and employability youth workshops was changed from\n            consultancy services to the use of a standard set of fees,\n            as used by other training courses. The Ministry hired fewer\n            consultants than planned because of a decision to\n            incorporate gradually temporary staff into its formal\n            structure. The Ministry also decided to finance some\n            expenditures envisaged under the project using national\n            resources in order to simplify internal procedures.\n            Moreover, the number of trained workers (financed under the\n            expenditure category of fees) has exceeded the project\n            target. In addition, the initial amount assigned to category\n            seven (youth stipends) was conservative as the youth\n            employment program was new and its pace of implementation\n            uncertain. In practice though coverage targets have been\n            exceeded.

As of\n            August 15, 2012, the loan has disbursed nearly US$170\n            million or about 80 percent of total proceeds. Overall\n            progress in project implementation is good.
