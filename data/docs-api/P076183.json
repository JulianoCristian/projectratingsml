Ratings for the Higher Education Learning and\n            Innovation Project for Yemen were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was highly unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Higher\n            Education Project for Jordan were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the introduction of a widely adopted change model\n            needs to be preceded by sufficient sector analytic work to\n            create an appreciation of the complexities (implications) of\n            the changes and of the likely sources of resistance. Such\n            analysis could help determine the parts of the model that\n            are appropriate to the context, and the pace of adoption.\n            Efforts to improve the quality of higher education need to\n            improve student learning outcomes. Standard assessment of\n            student achievement in higher education is challenging, both\n            in a technical and a political sense. Moves in that\n            direction have already begun in Egypt and Jordan.\n            Restructuring higher education courses and programs and\n            ensuring appropriate private sector participation in\n            decision-making are not in themselves sufficient to ensure\n            that reforms will result in more employable graduates.\n            Higher education systems need to systematically monitor the\n            labor market relevance of their offerings and the success of\n            their graduates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Higher Education Enhancement\n

      outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is crucial\n            to have a rigorous monitoring and evaluation plan for all\n            project activities to detect obstacles at early stages and\n            act quickly to prevent worsening of the problem and delay in\n            implementation. Furthermore, it is important to regularly\n            evaluate the quality of Technical Assistance (TA)\n            activities. Throughout the implementation of this project,\n            there was no solid and systematic evaluation of the\n            effectiveness and relevance of TA activities except for\n            contractors' final reports which contained general\n            self-assessment on their TA activities. Keeping decision\n            makers informed of project progress is critical for\n            appropriate readjustment of project scope and activities.\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) plays a key role in this\n            as it enables the effective collection and dissemination of\n            data and information to a wider group, including\n            beneficiaries. As seen with the diminished role of the\n            steering committee, the absence of M&E resulted in\n            missed opportunities to effectively guide the project as the\n            implementation environment evolved. Project re-structuring\n            should be considered at any time during project\n            implementation if substantial changes are being proposed by\n            the Borrower or additional donor resources become available\n            in an evolving environment. This project should have been\n            considered for restructuring to reflect a changing\n            government approach to reform and to re-align new objectives\n            with revised outcome indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Higher Education Learning and\n            Innovation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Higher Education Learning\n            and

in\n            the preparation of a higher education reform strategy, and\n            to pilot initial phases of its implementation, which, if\n            successful, would prod the development of a second,\n            medium-term phase of the reform, likely to require donor\n            support, and further Bank lending. Three main components\n            will support: 1) governance, by developing a strategy and\n            medium-term development plan for the education sector, and a\n            legislative and institutional framework, promoting improved\n            management. Activities include a participatory higher\n            education reform development, and the preparation of\n            medium-term investment program, comprising as well capacity\n            building to the Ministry of Higher Education staff, and,\n            technical training to the two universities involved, for\n            their management, and accountability assumption; 2)\n            financing of the redesign process of the universities'\n            budget structures, and procedures, to facilitate flexible\n            allocation of resources, and efficient expenditures.\n            Moreover, assistance for the development of equitable\n            funding mechanisms for universities will be provided, to\n            increase girls' education, and attendance by diverse\n            income-level groups. Information management systems, and\n            related training will be adapted to provide institutional\n            management services; and, 3) quality of education, by\n            upgrading the faculty in selected disciplines (medicine,\n            education, and commerce), and piloting strategic\n            initiatives, such as evaluation methods, and teaching\n            skills,
