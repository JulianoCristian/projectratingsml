Some lessons learned included:\n            balanced project design and adequate team supervision are\n            critical to achieve agreed intermediate indicators and final\n            goals. The project benefited from a very stable environment\n            and it has proven an ideal context for institutional\n            reforms. The National Financial Administration System\n            (SIGFE) project was instrumental in supporting these reforms\n            process, avoiding any disruption and facilitating an orderly\n            evolution process of modernization. Chile provides good\n            example for many nations. It has decided to take longer, but\n            critical steps. By doing so, transparency and governance\n            indicators compared with international benchmarks have been\n            stable and even facilitated the increase of foreign\n            investment and economic growth. The efficient allocation of\n            resources and timely reporting have promoted and benefited\n            from efficiency gains. It is crucial to incorporate the user\n            into the design and implementation process. The Central\n            Agencies needed to coordinate both the messages and the\n            actions in order to avoid confusion among the other agencies\n            and to maximize the impact on government functioning.\n            Finally, the importance of institutional tolerance to\n            mistakes and the open discussion of alternative solutions\n            protected the project goals. In the case of SIGFE, instead\n            of insisting on following the original plan, the project\n            redesigned the initially complex prototype that was\n            interfering with the dissemination process as soon as it was identified."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - First Public Expenditure Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile - First Public Expenditure\n

Within tight\n            fiscal constraints, project components will strengthen\n            financial management, and accountability as follows. First,\n            a unified information management system will be developed,\n            integrating a modular design into a single system for the\n            public sector, to validate operational transactions and data\n            recording, through extensive, advanced data-communications,\n            as institutionally required. Continuous system improvement\n            will be established, such as security systems, i.e.,\n            procurement, public credit, fixed assets, and inventory\n            management. Related sub-systems reform includes updating of\n            the accrual based public accounting system, improved cash\n            management policies, and procedures, and, procurement\n            reforms. Second, a multi-annual financial planning component\n            will strengthen capacity to focus on macroeconomic, fiscal,\n            and public investment policies, including budgeting by\n            results, with technical assistance for public program\n            evaluation as key tasks. The third, and fourth components\n            will finance the design of a human resources management\n            information system, and, strengthen financial, and human\n            resource management units respectively, while the fifth\n            component will finance the costs of the project coordinating\n            unit, i.e., activities, goods and services, operating costs,\n
