The overall project objective of supporting\n            Madagascar efforts to shift to a higher private sector led\n            growth path was achieved.  Four main lessons are drawn from\n            the implementation of PATESP: (i) A Technical Assistance\n            project should not be prepared and carried out without being\n            integrated in a well defined reform program. (ii)  To ensure\n            a rapid, positive and sustainable impact, a liberalization\n            and divestiture program aimed at adjusting the structures of\n            the economy should be more focused on key underperforming\n            sectors and public enterprises.  (iii) If political\n            commitment to divest is strong, the privatization committee\n            does not have to be independent and should include line\n            ministers who need to be given, to some extent, the control\n            of the divestiture process. However, the roles and\n            responsibilities of the privatization committee and the\n            privatization secretariat need to be clearly defined and\n            agreed.  (iv) Project costs, including supervision costs,\n            for complex and comprehensive technical assistance project\n            such as PATESP should be carefully estimated. Time and\n            resources necessary for land and asset titles regularization\n            should be carefully estimated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Private Sector Development and\n
