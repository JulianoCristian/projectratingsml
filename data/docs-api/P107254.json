Government\n            of Eritrea (GoE) also considered participation in the\n            Heavily Indebted Poor Country Initiative (HIPC) for which it\n            remained potentially eligible to receive debt relief.\n            However, client commitment to the necessary reforms was\n            uneven over the course of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN)\n            and as a consequence the Bank shifted focus to maximize\n            improved service delivery through the existing portfolio,\n            largely centered on human development, and select analytical\n            work. Domestic policies had not been conducive to growth.\n            While effective in addressing macroeconomic imbalances, they\n            acted as a constraint on economic growth resulting in a\n            decline in annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth per\n            capita since 2005. In recognition of this, the GoE had\n            started to adopt a strategy intended to revitalize the\n            economy by: (i) improving broad-based growth through rural\n            development; (ii) exploiting valuable mineral deposits;\n            (iii) developing tourism and commercial fishing; and (v)\n            encouraging investment in newly-established economic\n            tax-free zones. Despite the weak overall economic\n            performance, the government support for the social sectors\n            had remained strong and World Bank assistance had achieved\n            positive results in the health and early childhood and\n            education sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea - Second Integrated Early Childhood\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Eritrea - Second Integrated Early\n            Childhood Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/06/12619156/eritrea-second-integrated-early-childhood-development-project","projn":"ER-Integrated Early Childhood Development\n            Project II -- P107254","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Housing & Human Habitats,Primary Education,Population Policies","teratopic":"Education,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Eritrea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100805005258"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Pre-primary education,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adult education, adult life, adult\n            population, advocacy efforts, aged, anemia, basic social\n            services, breastfeeding, capacity building, care seeking,\n            caregivers, CDD, Child Development, child growth, Child\n            health, child survival, Childhood Illnesses, clinics,\n            cognitive tests, communities, Community Health, community\n            participation, Description, Development Objectives,\n            diarrhea, dropout, dropout rates, drugs, EARLY CHILDHOOD,\n            EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT, Early Childhood Education,\n            early education, economic development, economic growth,\n            Education Sector, equal access, families, family size, food\n            insecurity, food security, food supplies, General Education,\n            government capacity, government support, Gross Domestic\n            Product, health Education, health indicators, health\n            interventions, health outcomes, health services, Health\n            Workers, HIV, HIV/AIDS, households, human capital, Human\n            Development, Human Welfare, Illness, Illnesses, IMCI,\n            Immunodeficiency, infant, infant mortality, institutional\n            capacity, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness,\n            iodine, iodine-deficiency, Kindergarten, kindergartens,\n            learning, learning materials, live births, Malaria,\n            malnourished children, Malnutrition, malnutrition rates,\n            Maternal &amp;

There are three components to the\n            project. The first component of the project is maternal and\n            child health and nutrition. This component will strengthen\n            the community based health system in order to expand and\n            sustain the household and community Integrated Management of\n            Childhood Illnesses (HWC-IMCI), as well as growth monitoring\n            and promotion in villages already covered in Phase I. The\n            second component of the project is early childhood care and\n            education (ECCE). This component will aim at consolidating\n            quality provision of ECCE services already established in\n            Phase I, expanding cost effective ECCE services to cover all\n            children in the target villages, and ensuring sustainability\n            of interventions in target communities after the completion\n            of Phase II. The third component of the project is project\n            management, monitoring, evaluation, advocacy and strategic\n            communication. This component will provide overall\n            coordination and manage cross cutting issues of monitoring\n            and evaluation (M&E) and advocacy and strategic
