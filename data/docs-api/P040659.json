The performances of both the Bank and\n            the Borrower are rated satisfactory. Lessons by component\n            cited were several by project : 1. Within the limited fiscal\n            space of developing countries, involvement of community\n            volunteers provides a complementary and inexpensive method\n            for delivery of social services. 2. Given the importance of\n            health outcomes in early stages, if funds are limited,\n            community nutrition programs should primarily target\n            children below the age of two years old. 3. The project\n            design needs to be flexible to adapt to local realities. 4.\n            Sensitization and capacity building at all levels are\n            crucial for the project's success. 5. Poor access to\n            potable water hinders the project outcomes. 6. Street\n            children programs could achieve better results if they are\n            not limited just to basic assistance to children in the\n            street, but rather include development-oriented activities\n            through integration into the family, school and labor\n            market. 7. Not every NGO has enough knowledge and expertise\n            to deal with street children, and ,furthermore, NGO programs\n            alone are not enough to significantly reduce the number of\n            children in the street. It is crucial that NGOs cooperate\n            among themselves and with local governments to achieve\n            long-term impact and sustainability of interventions in the\n            area. 8. Strengthening the capacity of the family and\n            community to take care of their young members can increase\n            the efficiency of street children programs. 9. Strengthening\n            the poverty monitoring capacity of district assemblies leads\n            to their empowerment, increases accountability and informed\n            decision making. 10.  Poverty monitoring capacity building\n            for district assemblies needs to be harmonized and carried\n            out within the PRSP poverty monitoring efforts. 11. Given\n            the short time and limited resources allocated to learning\n            and Innovation Loans (LILs), such projects should not be\n            complicated in design and implementation. 12. The Bank staff\n            need to be more engaged in the preparation of LILs in order\n            to explain the learning and innovation nature of this\n            lending instrument. 13. The national team's lead on\n            project design, preparation and implementation builds\n            capacity and increases ownership of project objectives and outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Community-Based Poverty\n            Reduction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/05/6849132/ghana-community-based-poverty-reduction-project","projn":"GH-Community-Based Poverty Reduction Project\n            -- P040659","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Street Children,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Primary Education,Adolescent Health,Rural Poverty Reduction","teratopic":"Education,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development","count":"Ghana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060612102208"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account, Agricultural Development, aid\n            agencies, Basic Education, basic social services,\n            beneficiary assessments, beneficiary communities, birth\n            attendants, capacity building, child care, child mortality,\n            child mortality rates, children in the street, Community\n            Health, community nutrition, computer skills,\n            cost-effectiveness, crime, decision making, education,\n            families, farmers, food intake, food products, Food\n            Security, food security component, food security\n            interventions, formal education, girls, health, health care,\n            health outcomes, Health Planning, health services, housing,\n            human development, immunization, income-generating\n            activities, informed decision making, intervention,\n            leadership, Learning, literacy, malnutrition, manuals,\n            morbidity, numeracy, nurses, Nutrition, nutrition component,\n            nutrition programs, nutritional status, Patient, policy\n            document, potable water, poverty data, poverty indicators,\n            poverty measurement, poverty monitoring efforts, poverty\n            rates, POVERTY REDUCTION, poverty reduction actions, poverty\n            reduction interventions, poverty reduction programs, POVERTY\n            REDUCTION PROJECT, Poverty reduction Strategy, public\n            awareness, reproductive age, rural areas, Rural Bank, rural\n            children, Rural Development, safety nets, schools, skills\n            development, social assistance, social protection, Social\n            safety, social services, Street Children, Street children\n            programs, traditional birth attendants, vocational training,\n            vulnerable groups, Youth"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Learning and Innovation Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF025436-PHRD-GHANA COMMUNITY DEV.
