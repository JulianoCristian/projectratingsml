Some lessons\n            learned included: the analytical work conducted as part of\n            the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) and in preparation\n            for the first operation provided a thorough examination of\n            environmental priorities and an understanding of the\n            country's institutional framework for environmental\n            management. The actual process of carrying out the analysis\n            was equally as important, as it helped to build consensus\n            among stakeholders on reforms to the National Environmental\n            System (SINA). Inter-institutional coordination is essential\n            for strengthening the reform program. Inter-institutional\n            coordination, in particular National Planning Department\n            (DNP) participation in the DPL Program has been instrumental\n            in enhancing coordination among key SINA actors as well as\n            other line ministries. This coordination among line\n            ministries, as well as vertically between national and\n            regional authorities, has enriched policy development in the\n            areas of air quality, water quality, and environmental\n            health, as well as data collection required for the\n            monitoring of SINA's progress toward goals linked with\n            sustainable

is for a Second\n            Programmatic Development Policy Loan for Sustainable\n            Development (SusDevDPL II) to the government of Colombia.\n            This development policy loan (DPL) is the second in a series\n            of three loans supporting the government's efforts to\n            achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\n            Specifically, the program has the following objectives: (i)\n            improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the National\n            Environmental System (SINA); and (ii) integrating principles\n            of sustainable development into key sectors, with a\n            particular emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable\n            groups. The program supports developing a results-based\n            framework for planning and monitoring progress of the\n            Sistema Nacional de Ambiente (SINA) toward goals directly\n            linked with sustainable development and achievement o f the\n            MDGs; improvements in inter-institutional coordination and\n            increased public participation in decision-making; and\n            preparation of critical policies and regulations related to\n            air quality, water quality, solid waste management, and\n            environmental licensing. The SusDevDPL Program has clear\n            poverty implications, given that environmental degradation\n            disproportionately affects the poor and most vulnerable\n            populations, and thus increases inequality. Improvements in\n            air quality, water quality, and hygiene in urban centers\n            will lead to decreased morbidity and mortality from\n            diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory illnesses and other\n            health effects, and allow for reductions in avertive\n            expenditures to address health risks. Increased\n            accountability, transparency, and improved public\n            participation will provide the most vulnerable groups a\n            voice in environmental decision-making."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second Programmatic Development\n            Policy Loan for Sustainable Development"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Second
