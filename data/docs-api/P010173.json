The project achieved\n            its main objectives, its impact has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, there is a need to define\n            precisely the composition and staffing level of the project\n            implementation unit. Failure in having done so initially was\n            a reason for delay in project implementation. Second, a\n            balance should be maintained between pre-identified\n            subprojects and unidentified projects. Pre-identification of\n            subprojects allows for smoother and more rapid project\n            execution. However, unallocated funds providing financing\n            for subprojects that are identified as the Government\n            proceeds with its structural adjustment program provide\n            useful flexibility. An unallocated amount not exceeding 25\n            to 30 percent of the credit amount would be desirable.\n            Third, adoption and use of specific eligibility criteria for\n            selecting projects is important to implement the project\n            efficiently. Lastly, adequate Bank staff resources should be\n            allocated to supervise the implementation of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/06/738468/pakistan-technical-assistance-project","projn":"PK-Technical Assistance-272669 -- P010173","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,ICT Policy and Strategies,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925141249"},"subsc":"(Historic)Public sector management adjustment","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,adverse effects,Agricultural\n            Prices,Agriculture,Audit reports,balance of payments,Bank\n            lending,Bank management,banking\n            system,coal,competitiveness,computer equipment,Consumer\n            interests,consumers,cotton,crops,deficits,development\n            strategy,economic forecasting,economic growth,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,exports,farmers,feasibility\n            studies,financial stability,Fiscal Year,fisheries,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,Gross national\n            savings,imports,income,industrial\n            enterprises,inflation,insurance,irrigation,lending\n            operations,livestock,nominal GNP,oil,oil prices,OPEC,policy\n            makers,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,programming,programs,regulatory\n            framework,rice,savings,Structural Adjustment,Technical\n            Assistance,training activities,transport,UNDP,user\n            charges,water use,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,adverse effects,Agricultural\n            Prices,Agriculture,Audit reports,balance of payments,Bank\n            lending,Bank management,banking\n            system,coal,competitiveness,computer equipment,Consumer\n            interests,consumers,cotton,crops,deficits,development\n            strategy,economic forecasting,economic growth,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,exports,farmers,feasibility\n            studies,financial stability,Fiscal Year,fisheries,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,Gross national\n            savings,imports,income,industrial\n            enterprises,inflation,insurance,irrigation,lending\n            operations,livestock,nominal GNP,oil,oil prices,OPEC,policy\n            makers,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,programming,programs,regulatory\n            framework,rice,savings,Structural Adjustment,Technical\n            Assistance,training activities,transport,UNDP,user\n            charges,water use,wheat"}},"owner":"Econ.
