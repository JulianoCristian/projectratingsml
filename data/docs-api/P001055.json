First, a\n            ministry with vested interests in a public enterprise should\n            not be in charge of the divestiture of the enterprise.\n            Second, it is essential to assess the feasibility of social\n            equity and universal coverage objectives during the design\n            of post and telecommunications sector reform projects.\n            Third, the best way to improve telecommunications service\n            quality, coverage, and regulation is to open the sector to\n            competition and not protect the incumbent company, whether\n            public or private.

The project has two major orientations: launching\n            Societe des Telecommunications de Guinee (SOTELGUI) and\n            Office de las poste guineenne (OPG) on a firm basis, by\n            financing key appointments in administrative and operational\n            positions, and reorganizing the Ministry as the policy-maker\n            and regulator for the sector. The project includes the\n            following components: (a) two years of assistance for\n            institution building; (b) reorganization of the Ministry of\n            Communication, particularly concerning its supervisory\n            functions (planning, tariff and financial policies, social\n            policy, service quality) and regulatory functions (frequency\n            control, licenses to operate networks or to sell equipment);\n            (c) the search for professional partners for SOTELGUI, in\n            accordance with the Public Enterprise Sector Rationalization\n            and Privatization Technical Assistance (PESERP)\n            project's privatization framework (Cr. 2398-GUI);
