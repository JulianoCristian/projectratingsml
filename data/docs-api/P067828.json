Some lessons learned includes: long-term\n            engagement with the government through the partnership\n            program has paid off: the China Renewable Energy Scale-up\n            Program (CRESP) program is the only window in the\n            Bank's China energy portfolio that engages long-term RE\n            policy dialogues and partnership with the National Energy\n            Administration (NEA). A programmatic approach, which blends\n            policy dialogue, technical assistance, and investments\n            through International Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development/ Global Environment Facility (IBRD/GEF) funding,\n            is the best conduit for scaling up RE in client countries.\n            Combining policy support and technical assistance through a\n            GEF grant with large-scale long-term financing for RE\n            investments through IBRD loans in one package is the most\n            effective and powerful tool to enable transformational\n            changes to scale up renewable energy. Flexible approach to\n            adapt to government's priorities and changing\n            environment is required: This is because RE policies require\n            frequent adjustments as Renewable energy (RE) technologies\n            evolve and make progress towards competitiveness. Improving\n            manufacturing quality is essential for the transition to a\n            world-class manufacturing industry: the key to the success\n            of the wind technology improvement component was to\n            simultaneously address wind turbine standards, testing, and\n            certification, and to support wind manufacturers in\n            developing megawatt-scale wind turbines. The piecemeal\n            approach and fragmentation of policy study contracts\n            resulted in lengthy delays and weakened policy impacts:\n            during project implementation, the Project Management Office\n            (PMO) issued a large number of small contracts. Programmatic\n            approach needs intensive supervision from the Bank team:\n            CRESP required intensive supervision to provide guidance and\n            advice to the PMO in implementing the large number of\n            activities under CRESP."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Renewable Energy Scale-up Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Renewable

The issues include the following: Reduce\n            water and land pollution caused by setting a sediment basin\n            and oil trap for factory sewage, using septic tanks to\n            control domestic sewage, treating domestic sewage, and\n            isolating and fencing disposal sites, using temporary dump\n            sites in the construction area, sending waste to a\n            government-approved landfill weekly, and strictly executing\n            a wastewater discharge standard, and recovering land after\n            site removal and replanting. To control noise nuisance,\n            select low-noise equipment, use shock absorbers and noise\n            insulation, schedule reasonable operation times, ban night\n            construction but if needed give local people advance notice,\n            prohibit night driving, and warn local residents if blasting\n            is needed. To control dust, use dustproof covers for\n            machinery and cement areas, and spray area and access roads.\n            To promote worker health and safety, set up medical\n            facilities and encourage hygiene control, and train workers.\n            To reduce soil erosion and surface water  runoff, plan\n            construction for the dry season, use designated sites for\n            deposits, avoid disposal in water bodies, use silt traps,\n            and restore farmland.

To control noise nuisance,\n            select low-noise equipment, use shock absorbers and noise\n            insulation, schedule reasonable operation times, ban night\n            construction but if needed give local people advance notice,\n            prohibit night driving, and warn local residents if blasting\n            is needed. To control dust, use dustproof covers for\n            machinery and cement areas, and spray area and access roads.\n            To promote worker health and safety, set up medical\n            facilities and encourage hygiene control, and train workers.\n            To reduce soil erosion and surface water  runoff, plan\n            construction for the dry season, use designated sites for\n            deposits, avoid disposal in water bodies, use silt traps,\n            and restore farmland. Get official approval before\n            proceeding with construction when finding cultural\n            artifacts. Ban the purchase of any electrical or hydro\n            mechanical equipment that contains polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Huitengxile wind power project in Inner\n            Mongolia : environmental impact assessment, revised"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
