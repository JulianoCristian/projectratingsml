In order to encourage a reduction\n            in KDB's reliance on long-term official borrowings, the\n            loan will incorporate a special amortization feature, which\n            will permit the blending of Bank and commercial resources.\n            There are no special risks associated with the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Fourth Development Bank Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Fourth Development Bank Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/11/726212/korea-fourth-development-bank-project","projn":"KR-Kdb IV -- P004096","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Korea, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912511464"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accelerated\n            depreciation,accounting,ADB,agriculture,assets,balance of\n            payments,Bank Lending,Bank of Korea,banking sector,banking\n            system,Basic metals,bonds,capital markets,Central\n            Bank,cities,Commercial banks,commercial loans,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,Corporate Financial\n            Structure,current prices,debt,Demand\n            deposits,Deposits,development banks,development\n            strategy,disintermediation,economic development,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economic sectors,employment,equity\n            investments,excess demand,exchange rate,export\n            growth,exports,financial disintermediation,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediaries,financial\n            intermediation,FINANCIAL SECTOR,Financial Structure,fiscal\n            policies,foreign banks,Foreign Exchange,GNP,Gross Fixed\n            Capital Formation,Gross National Product,growth\n            potential,growth rate,housing,imports,income,industrial\n            expansion,Inflation,insurance,interest rate,interest\n            rates,inventory,KDB,labor costs,Labor productivity,Land\n            Development,legislation,Lending Rates,Low interest\n            rates,maturities,maturity,nonbank financial\n            institutions,nonbank institutions,offerings,private\n            banks,productivity,Profitability,protectionism,real GNP,real\n            wages,regional banks,Resource Allocation,Resource\n            Mobilization,retained earnings,Savings,savings\n            accounts,Savings Deposits,securities,short term\n            debt,specialized banks,term finance,value\n            added,wages,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accelerated\n            depreciation,accounting,ADB,agriculture,assets,balance of\n            payments,Bank Lending,Bank of Korea,banking sector,banking\n            system,Basic metals,bonds,capital markets,Central\n            Bank,cities,Commercial banks,commercial loans,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,Corporate Financial\n            Structure,current prices,debt,Demand\n            deposits,Deposits,development banks,development\n            strategy,disintermediation,economic development,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economic sectors,employment,equity\n            investments,excess demand,exchange rate,export\n            growth,exports,financial disintermediation,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediaries,financial\n            intermediation,FINANCIAL SECTOR,Financial Structure,fiscal\n            policies,foreign banks,Foreign Exchange,GNP,Gross Fixed\n            Capital Formation,Gross National Product,growth\n            potential,growth rate,housing,imports,income,industrial\n            expansion,Inflation,insurance,interest rate,interest\n            rates,inventory,KDB,labor costs,Labor productivity,Land\n            Development,legislation,Lending Rates,Low interest\n            rates,maturities,maturity,nonbank financial\n            institutions,nonbank institutions,offerings,private\n            banks,productivity,Profitability,protectionism,real GNP,real\n            wages,regional banks,Resource Allocation,Resource\n            Mobilization,retained earnings,Savings,savings\n            accounts,Savings Deposits,securities,short term\n            debt,specialized banks,term finance,value\n            added,wages,working capital"}},"owner":"East Asia & Pacific Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"3106"},"facets":{}}}
