The lessons learned indicate that valuation of\n            market size needs to consider substitute markets. To enhance\n            the possibility of small companies to participate under\n            projects promoting small and medium-sized renewable energy\n            systems, procurement rules in the project design need to\n            cater for their participation. Improving product quality and\n            reliability are important factors in stimulating and\n            sustaining demand. Projects based on concessionary finance\n            that support products over a limited time period should\n            actively consider how the sustainability of a market can be\n            assured following project closure. Sustainability can be\n            achieved by (i) including barrier removal activities; (ii)\n            considering learning cost curves; (iii) establishing a\n            stakeholder community, including through a network of local\n            industry; and by (iv) providing a framework for market\n            development (extending customer base both domestically and abroad)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Solar Water Heating Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Solar Water Heating Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5508350/tunisia-solar-water-heating-project","projn":"TN-Solar Water Heating -- P005589","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041217111459"},"subsc":"Renewable energy","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture, basin, Bidding, bilateral\n            donors, Carbon, Carbon Dioxide, Climate change, demand\n            analysis, Desertification, economic analysis, economic\n            impact, Economists, emission, emission reductions,\n            emissions, Employment, energy consumption, energy\n            efficiency, environmental health, Environmental policies,\n            Exchange Rate, export, fossil fuels, fuelwood, Gas, global\n            warming, HEATING, households, income, incremental costs,\n            inflation, Marginal Costs, Middle East, natural resources,\n            natural resources management, North Africa, oil, overhead\n            costs, Petroleum, Pollution, Present Value, Private Sector,\n            procurement, production costs, project management, quality\n            control, savings, solar energy, suppliers, Technical\n            Assistance, terms of trade, TUNISIA, water demand, Water\n            Heaters, water industry, water use"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF023485-USDOE-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY ACTIVITIES,TF025141-GEF-TUNISIA SOLAR WATER HEATING PROJECT,TF028636-GET-PPA TUNISIA SOLAR WATER HEATING,TF028666-GET-TUNISIA SOLAR WATER HEATING PROJECT","repnb":"30910"},"697985":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/10/697985/tunisia-solar-water-heating-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/10/697985/tunisia-solar-water-heating-project","new_url":"1994/10/697985/tunisia-solar-water-heating-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/10/01/000009265_3961219144159/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/10/01/000009265_3961219144159/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","datestored":"2001-04-17T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1994-10-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Solar Water Heating Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Solar Water\n            Heating (SWH) Project are to assist the recipient in\n            encouraging the substitution of renewable solar energy for\n            fossil fuels in public and commercial private institutions\n            so as to mitigate global warming by maximizing carbon\n            dioxide displacement and demonstrate the potential of solar\n            water heating for reducing global warming.
