Some lessons learned included:\n            ensuring quality at entry during project preparation is a\n            determinant for an early and sustained good physical and\n            financial implementation progress.  Ensuring a functional\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system, including an\n            appropriate project Results Framework (RF), as a means to\n            make informed policy decisions and budget allocations, and\n            gauge achievement of project outcomes and component targets.\n            Institutionalization (mainstreaming) of parallel projects\n            into MoE requires a time-bound capacity building and skills\n            transfer plan and strategy, explicitly laid out as part of\n            consultant ToRs. Some principles to be reflected in such\n            ToRs include: (a) recruitment of qualified local staff\n            (mentees) to be paired to consultants (mentors); (b) a clear\n            mentoring/coaching program for local staff; (c) clear\n            intermediate and final measurable targets to ascertain\n            skills/competencies acquisition; and (d) a simple\n            verification mechanism by a qualifying third party. This\n            skills transfer plan and strategy was absent in ESSP and it\n            is still absent today in MoE. An approximation to the above\n            was the transformation experienced by Infrastructure\n            Facilities Unit, or IFU, from being a parallel project unit\n            heavily dependent

Leste 2011 Early Grade Mathematics\n            Assessment (EGMA) : baseline report"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"In 2011, the Timor-Leste Ministry of\n            Education, with assistance from the World Bank and Ausaid,\n            conducted the first Early Grade Mathematics Assessment\n            (EGMA) survey in Timor-Leste. More than 1200 students in\n            sixty five schools were surveyed in Grades One, Two and\n            Three. The analysis of the EGMA 2011 Timor-Leste baseline\n            survey calls for an immediate response to safeguard the\n            educational future of young Timorese students. Although\n            students perform well in basic, Phase Zero mathematics\n            skills such as oral counting and correspondence counting,\n            Phase One skills (number identification) shows signs of slow\n            gains. Later manipulative and calculation skills, i.e. those\n            in Phase Two and Phase Three (quantity discrimination,\n            missing numbers, word problems and arithmetic) are poorly\n            understood and used by Timorese students. After three years\n            of schooling, Grade Three students can only answer forty six\n            percent of simple subtraction problems correctly on average\n            and only seventy two percent of addition problems, all of\n            which should have been understood by the end of Grade One.\n            The low ability of Timorese students to handle basic\n            numeracy puts in doubt their ability to cope with an\n            increasingly stringent curriculum in later years. Language\n            use was one of the most concerning aspects of mathematics\n            education revealed by the survey. Although the main language\n            of the classroom is Tetum, students\u2019 mathematics textbooks\n            are in Portuguese. Some students did not speak enough Tetum\n            or Portuguese to complete the survey without aid of a\n            translator for their local languages. This linguistic\n            diversity within the classroom indicates that further\n            research into how Timorese students learn and in which\n            languages is required. In terms of factors that showed\n            positive association with early mathematic abilities, the\n            participation in daily mathematics lessons, working with\n            others in those lessons and doing homework were all\n            associated with statistically significant improvements in\n            mathematics outcomes at the ninety five percent level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor Leste 2011 Early Grade Mathematics\n            Assessment (EGMA) : baseline report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor Leste 2011 Early Grade\n            Mathematics Assessment (EGMA) : baseline report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/12/26567324/timor-leste-2011-early-grade-mathematics-assessment-egma-baseline-report","topic":"Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Education Indicators and Statistics\n            m1326116 1522,Education Strategic Planning and\n            Management m1326114 1519,Education m1327048 470,Education Policy and Planning m1326781 1513,Education Funding Formulae m1326555 1496,Education Reform m1327269 1518","projn":"TP-Education Sector Support -- P095873","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Educational Policy and Planning,Education Indicators and Statistics,Education Reform and Management,Educational Institutions & Facilities,Education Finance,Education For All","teratopic":"Education","count":"Timor-Leste","authors":{"authr":"McNamee,Bronwyn"},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08444f621_1_0"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Improving labor markets,Education for all","subsc":"Central Government,Early Childhood Education,Primary education,Secondary education","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Education Indicators and Statistics\n            m1326116 1522,Education Strategic Planning and\n            Management m1326114 1519,Education m1327048 470,Education Policy and Planning m1326781 1513,Education Funding Formulae m1326555 1496,Education Reform m1327269 1518","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"education, finance, growth, policy, management"}},"owner":"Education - GP (GEDDR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF090564-AUSAID TRUST FUND FOR\n            TIMOR-LESTE EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT,TF093335-TP-EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT,TF095598-Gacougnolle ETC Support,TF011711-TF090673 - AUSAID TF for Timor\n            Leste Education Sector Support Project -,TF092230-TP-EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT,TF090672-AUSAID TF FOR TL EDUCATION\n            SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT -  JUST-IN-TIME POLIC,TF090673-AUSAID TF FOR TL EDUCATION\n            SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT - BANK INCREMENTAL SUPERVISION","majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management","repnb":"106887"},"26567323":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/07/26567323/timor-leste-2011-early-grade-reading-assessment-egra-tetum-pilot-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/07/26567323/timor-leste-2011-early-grade-reading-assessment-egra-tetum-pilot-project","new_url":"2016/07/26567323/timor-leste-2011-early-grade-reading-assessment-egra-tetum-pilot-project","disclosure_date":"2016-07-13T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-07-14T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-07-14T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b08444f544","chronical_docm_id":"090224b08444f544","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2016/07/13/090224b08444f544/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/Timor0Leste02000tetum0pilot0project.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2016/07/13/090224b08444f544/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Timor0Leste02000tetum0pilot0project.pdf","loan_no":"H5830","datestored":"2016-07-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2013-12-24T06:11:02Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Timor Leste 2011 Early Grade Reading\n            Assessment (EGRA) : tetum pilot project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"In 2011, a second Early Grade Reading\n            Assessment (EGRA) survey was carried out in Timor Leste to\n            diagnose reading levels in the country after the expansion\n            of access to primary schooling. Originally, the survey was\n            intended to analyze both Tetum and Portuguese literacy\n            skills together, however, due to technical requirements the\n            survey was divided into two language strands ex post: Tetum\n            and Portuguese. The Tetum survey yielded interesting results\n            discussed in this report that yield important research\n            questions for future exploration. However, due to the\n            implementation of the current language and curriculum policy\n            as well as resourcing constraints of the Timor Leste\n            education system in Portuguese, findings from the Portuguese\n            survey are inconclusive and should be considered as an aid\n            to future research rather than a baseline survey. Students\n            show grade progression in Tetum language, albeit progression\n            starting from a low base and exhibiting some slowness.\n            Approximately 26 percent of students in Grades 1-3 meet a\n            fluency benchmark of 45 correct words per minute in Tetum\n            which is associated to 70 percent comprehension.\n            Socio-economic, school and specific factors associated with\n            better reading outcomes include speaking Tetum at home,\n            access to printed materials at home, teacher attendance at\n            in-service and reading with family at home."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor Leste 2011 Early Grade Reading\n            Assessment (EGRA) : tetum pilot project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor Leste 2011 Early Grade\n            Reading Assessment (EGRA) : tetum pilot project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/12/26567323/timor-leste-2011-early-grade-reading-assessment-egra-tetum-pilot-project","topic":"Education Funding Formulae m1326555 1496,Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Education Indicators and Statistics\n            m1326116 1522,Education m1327048 470,Education Access and Equity m1327050 2127,Education Finance m1327514 498","projn":"TP-Education Sector Support -- P095873","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Educational Policy and Planning,Education Indicators and Statistics,Education Reform and Management,Educational Institutions & Facilities,Education For All","teratopic":"Education","count":"Timor-Leste","authors":{"authr":"Gacougnolle,Luc-Charles"},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08444f544_1_0"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Improving labor markets,Education for all","subsc":"Central Government,Early Childhood Education,Primary education,Secondary education","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Education Funding Formulae m1326555 1496,Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Education Indicators and Statistics\n            m1326116 1522,Education m1327048 470,Education Access and Equity m1327050 2127,Education Finance m1327514 498","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"education, finance, growth, policy, access"}},"owner":"Education - GP (GEDDR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF090564-AUSAID TRUST FUND FOR\n            TIMOR-LESTE EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT,TF093335-TP-EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT,TF095598-Gacougnolle ETC Support,TF011711-TF090673 - AUSAID TF for Timor\n            Leste Education Sector Support Project -,TF092230-TP-EDUCATION SECTOR SUPPORT,TF090672-AUSAID TF FOR TL EDUCATION\n            SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT -  JUST-IN-TIME POLIC,TF090673-AUSAID TF FOR TL EDUCATION\n            SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT - BANK INCREMENTAL SUPERVISION","majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management","repnb":"106886"},"18740784":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/06/18740784/building-evidence-shaping-policy-findings-2012-timor-leste-education-survey","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/06/18740784/building-evidence-shaping-policy-findings-2012-timor-leste-education-survey","new_url":"2016/06/18740784/building-evidence-shaping-policy-findings-2012-timor-leste-education-survey","disclosure_date":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-06-30T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b0828c7df7","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0828c7df7","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/02/000356161_20140102163942/Rendered/INDEX/837660WP0P132100Box0382105B00OUO090.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2014/01/02/000356161_20140102163942/Rendered/PDF/837660WP0P132100Box0382105B00OUO090.pdf","loan_no":"H5830","docdt":"2013-08-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2014-01-02T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Building evidence, shaping policy :\n            findings of the 2012 Timor-Leste education survey"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Reliable evidence is needed to design\n            policies that will allow overcoming Timor-Leste's\n            remaining challenges in provision of quality education. In\n            recent post-conflict years, aided by availability of oil\n            revenues, Timor-Leste has been able to considerably improve\n            availability of schools and access to education. This report\n            presents findings of the 2012 Education Survey,\n            collaboration between the Ministry of Education, the\n            National Directorate of Statistics, AusAID and the World\n            Bank. The survey collected detailed information at all\n            primary, pre-secondary and secondary schools in the country.\n            Its objectives were to support the improvement of\n            Timor-Leste's education quality and service delivery\n            through building a solid information source and analytical\n            foundation which will allow for sound, evidence-based policy\n            making. The survey results indicate that student absenteeism\n            should be a major cause for concern. More than one third of\n            grade one students were absent from school on the day of the\n            survey, in some districts it was half or even more.\n            Education levels of primary school teachers are low, with\n            the majority only having secondary education. For 71 percent\n            of primary school teachers the highest level of education is\n            secondary school, for 6 percent it is even lower. Both\n            demand and supply side interventions are needed to tackle\n            the challenges faced. Some key policy areas should be: 1)\n            improving school attendance through creating appropriate\n            demand-side incentives; 2) enhancing teacher quality; 3)\n            strengthening instruction language policy; 4) improving\n            education system management; 5) improving school\n            infrastructure and learning environment; and 6) ensuring\n            adequate supply of textbooks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Building evidence, shaping policy : findings\n            of the 2012 Timor-Leste education survey"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Building

SABER -\n            Teachers considers two policy levers school systems can use\n            to reach this goal: (1) expectations for what students\n            should know and be able to do, and how teachers can help\n            students reach these goals; (2) useful guidance on teachers\u2019\n            use of time to be able to improve instruction at the school\n            level. In Timor-Leste, there are clear expectations for what\n            students and teachers are supposed to do. Timor-Leste has\n            defined an education system framework that informs teachers\n            about the objectives of each level of education and has set\n            national standards for what students must know and be able\n            to achieve at different grades. Additionally, the tasks that\n            teachers are expected to carry out are officially stipulated\n            in the teachers career regime, which was recently approved,\n            including the diversity of teachers activities beyond\n            instructionPolicies define the variety of teacher tasks and\n            provide appropriate time to complete them all."},"docna":{"cdata!":"SABER teacher policy : Timor-Leste 2013"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"SABER teacher policy :\n            Timor-Leste 2013"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/01/26563403/saber-teacher-policy-timor-leste-2013","topic":"Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Education Indicators and Statistics\n            m1326116 1522,Education Management Information Systems\n            m1326115 1504,Education Reform m1327269 1518,Education Policy and Planning m1326781 1513,Education Projections m1327270 2148,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497","projn":"TP-Education Sector Support -- P095873","docty":"Brief","count":"Timor-Leste","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b084448076_1_0"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Improving labor markets,Education for all","colti":"Systems Approach for Better Education\n            Results (SABER) country report : teacher policy","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Education Indicators and Statistics\n            m1326116 1522,Education Management Information Systems\n            m1326115 1504,Education Reform m1327269 1518,Education Policy and Planning m1326781 1513,Education Projections m1327270 2148,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","owner":"Education -
