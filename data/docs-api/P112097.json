Some lessons learned includes:\n            capacity building projects should not be designed as\n            two-year projects. In a conflict country environment such\n            projects should be designed for at least a five-year period.\n            In post-conflict situations capacity building is a real\n            challenge due to the difficulty in attracting suitably\n            qualified experts to the field. On the job training,\n            supplemented by short-term courses, can be an effective\n            capacity building approach, but it requires sustained effort\n            over a long period of time, and may not be relevant for a\n            post conflict context. There are greater incentives within\n            the Government to implement technical assistance programs\n            when they are linked to specific investments, rather than as\n            standalone projects. Future capacity building programs could\n            consider over-staffing, to cater for staff turnover, or\n            providing training to multiple members of the team to ensure\n            greater distribution of skills. Project design requires time\n            and effort to assure the commitment of the Borrower.\n            In-country supervision teams, especially in conflict areas,\n            are more effective by their ability to closely interact with\n            the client and follow up on project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Technical Assistance for\n            Water-Sector Capacity
