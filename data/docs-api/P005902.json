The design for achieving intended project\n            results should not be overly dependent upon unpredictable\n            inputs from other projects or agencies. Demand-driven,\n            community-based approaches need to be designed in ways that\n            are as streamlined and realistic as possible, taking into\n            account community time constraints. Supervision should pay\n            close attention to implementation performance and act\n            quickly to modify the project if implementation is lagging\n            due to poor design or an overly difficult political context.\n            When major modifications have taken place (components\n            drastically reduced and/or increased, major new activities\n            added), formal restructuring should be seriously considered.\n            While the project had targets concerning project benefits\n            for women and certain outputs were achieved, more specific\n            strategies and focused attention on reaching this target\n            group could have increased the level of outcomes attained."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Southern Governorates Agricultural\n            Privatization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Southern Governorates\n            Agricultural Privatization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/08/6980355/yemen-southern-governorates-agricultural-privatization-project","projn":"RY-Southern Governorates Agricultural\n            Privatization -- P005902","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Urban Slums Upgrading,Community Development and Empowerment,Urban Services to the Poor,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems","teratopic":"Social Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Urban Development,Rural Development","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060809091815"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other social services,Irrigation and drainage,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Urban Development,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Cooperatives, Agricultural\n            Development, Agricultural extension, agricultural land,\n            agricultural production, agricultural services, Agriculture,\n            animal health, animal husbandry, capacity building,\n            Community Capacity, Community Capacity Building, community\n            committees, community contributions, community development,\n            community infrastructure, community institutions, community\n            management, community members, community organizations,\n            community participation, community planning, Community\n            Projects, community water supply, conflict, consultation,\n            Cost \u00adEffectiveness, cost-effectiveness, decentralization,\n            drainage, Economic Development, Education, employment,\n            employment opportunities, equipment, extension agents, farm\n            activities, farm income, farm management, farmers, financial\n            management, Fisheries, Health, incomes, Irrigation, lack of\n            credit, land development, land ownership, land tenure, land\n            titles, landless families, Lessons Learned, livelihoods,\n            Livestock, Local Authority, Middle East, natural resources\n            management, North Africa, O&M, participatory irrigation\n            management, participatory process, political support,\n            pollution, poor, poor people, poor rural people, poverty\n            alleviation, poverty levels, poverty line, Poverty\n            Reduction, Poverty Reduction Strategy, procurement, Project\n            Implementation, Public Works, remote areas, road\n            construction, Rural, rural access, Rural Communities, Rural\n            Development, rural markets, rural roads, rural water, rural\n            water supply, savings, schools, social services, Soil\n            Conservation, structural reforms, targeting, Technical\n            assistance, urban areas, Urban Planning, war, Water Resources"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF029109-PHRD-S.

The project\n            components are five. The land allocation and development or\n            rehabilitation component comprises a series of activities\n            designed to establish very poor landless families within the\n            target communities in sustainable new farming operations.\n            Its subcomponents are (a) assigning secure title for lands\n            to be developed or rehabilitated to largely dispossessed\n            families; (b) developing and rehabilitating irrigated land,\n            and setting up or reinforcing water monitoring; and (c)\n            farmer services, including training and extension (using\n            contract professionals), help to access credit for equipment\n            and inputs, and material support to farm establishment. The\n            off-farm income development component comprises three sets\n            of activities to assist poor people in setting up or\n            developing very small or small businesses, or in acquiring\n            technical skills training needed to find remunerative\n            employment:  a) training and equipping villagers,\n            particularly women, to become animal health providers; b)\n            training and equipping new entrants to the fisheries\n            business on the south coast; and c) promoting other\n            revenue-earning services and micro-enterprises. The economic\n            and social development component, which targets communities,\n            comprises two sets of activities: a) development of\n            community management skills and institutions by providing\n            training and logistical support to community organizations;\n            and b) setting up a community development fund that finances\n            small grants for community projects on a cost-sharing basis.\n            The fourth component provides technical assistance and\n            training to help prepare future projects in the sector. The\n            fifth component consists of operating the Project Management\n            Unit, which finances technical assistance, project staff,\n            vehicles, office equipment, office
