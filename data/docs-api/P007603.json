The project will also provide\n            financing to facilitate the test marketing of a new lower\n            price house although project beneficiaries will generally be\n            above the poverty line, (above two minimum wages),\n            beneficiaries closer to the poverty line will be reached. If\n            the test marketing is successful it is estimated that about\n            300,000 Type A houses would be constructed during the\n            period, with about 19% of the program's financing\n            provided under the loan. The project also includes studies\n            related to savings mobilization and investment in rental properties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Housing Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Housing Finance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/05/727854/mexico-housing-finance-project","projn":"MX-Housng Fin -- P007603","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Economics,Financial Intermediation,Housing Finance,Non Bank Financial Institutions","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926211222"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban housing","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,administrative costs,affordable\n            housing,Bank Lending,bank liabilities,banking sector,Banking\n            System,Borrowing,capitalization,cash\n            flow,checking,Commercial\n            Banks,consolidation,construction,Debt,Debt\n            Service,deposits,Disbursement,Down payments,economic\n            growth,electricity,employment,Financial Data,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediation,financial\n            markets,financial statements,financial structure,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed rate mortgages,foreclosures,foreign\n            exchange,Gross Domestic Product,household\n            income,Houses,Housing,housing construction,housing\n            credit,Housing Finance,Housing Finance System,housing\n            financing,housing loans,housing needs,housing\n            policies,Housing Policy,income\n            distribution,inflation,inflation rates,interest\n            rates,liquidity,loan maturity,local governments,low cost\n            Housing,metropolitan areas,Mortgage,mortgage\n            lending,mortgage loan,mortgage loans,mortgage\n            payments,mortgages,Operating Income,penalties,present\n            value,private housing,private sector,profitability,public\n            agencies,Public Housing,public housing finance,public\n            investment,Public Sector,Public Services,rent control,rental\n            housing,resource mobilization,retained\n            earnings,roads,Savings,savings schemes,Tax,Urban\n            Development,urban growth,urban infrastructure,urbanization,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,administrative costs,affordable\n            housing,Bank Lending,bank liabilities,banking sector,Banking\n            System,Borrowing,capitalization,cash\n            flow,checking,Commercial\n            Banks,consolidation,construction,Debt,Debt\n            Service,deposits,Disbursement,Down payments,economic\n            growth,electricity,employment,Financial Data,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediation,financial\n            markets,financial statements,financial structure,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed rate mortgages,foreclosures,foreign\n            exchange,Gross Domestic Product,household\n            income,Houses,Housing,housing construction,housing\n            credit,Housing Finance,Housing Finance System,housing\n            financing,housing loans,housing needs,housing\n            policies,Housing Policy,income\n            distribution,inflation,inflation rates,interest\n            rates,liquidity,loan maturity,local governments,low cost\n            Housing,metropolitan areas,Mortgage,mortgage\n            lending,mortgage loan,mortgage loans,mortgage\n            payments,mortgages,Operating Income,penalties,present\n            value,private housing,private sector,profitability,public\n            agencies,Public Housing,public housing finance,public\n            investment,Public Sector,Public Services,rent control,rental\n            housing,resource mobilization,retained\n            earnings,roads,Savings,savings schemes,Tax,Urban\n            Development,urban growth,urban infrastructure,urbanization,wages"}},"owner":"WB Off:Mexico - MX & CO CMU (LCC1C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"7097"},"facets":{}}}
