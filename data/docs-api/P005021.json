Besides supporting MIDB in promoting and\n            financing medium and larger industries in the private sector\n            in Egypt, which has received renewed Government support\n            recently, it will support in particular industries in three\n            sectors which have been identified as priorities for growth\n            in the Egyptian economy: a minimum of 25 percent of loan\n            proceeds would be allocated each for building materials and\n            construction/contracting industries; capital goods\n            industries; and export oriented industries. During the\n            commitment period, MIDB's institutional framework would\n            be further strengthened to provide assistance to industrial\n            enterprises in the private sector. The risks are associated\n            with the possible failure of MIDB to fully utilize the funds\n            allocated for capital goods and export oriented projects,\n            although diligent promotion should enable MIDB to meet the\n            target allocation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Misr Iran Development Bank Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Misr Iran Development\n            Bank Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/04/726411/egypt-misr-iran-development-bank-project","projn":"EG-Dfc IV (Midb I) -- P005021","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912481228"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,bank branches,bank\n            deposits,basic metals,bilateral agreements,capital\n            goods,capital markets,Central Bank,Central Bank of\n            Egypt,civilian labor force,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,construction,construction\n            techniques,controlled prices,Cost of\n            Capital,deposits,developed countries,development\n            banking,development banks,Economic Cooperation,economic\n            development,employment,Equity capital,equity\n            investments,exchange rate,exchange rates,export\n            growth,exports,FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,financial\n            intermediaries,Financial Performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,forecasts,foreign exchange,gas,GDP,gross value,growth\n            potential,housing,imports,income,INDUSTRIAL\n            SECTOR,Industrialization,Inflation,inflation rate,Inflation\n            rates,Insurance,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            banks,International Trade,inventory,iron,labor\n            costs,liquidity,loan financing,Manufacturing\n            Industry,metals,organizational structure,ownership\n            structure,portfolios,price controls,price levels,production\n            efficiency,productivity,rate of exchange,resource\n            mobilization,savings,securities,shareholders,state owned\n            banks,stock exchanges,tax rates,technical assistance,total\n            costs,transport,value added,wages,wholesale price\n            index,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,bank branches,bank\n            deposits,basic metals,bilateral agreements,capital\n            goods,capital markets,Central Bank,Central Bank of\n            Egypt,civilian labor force,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,construction,construction\n            techniques,controlled prices,Cost of\n            Capital,deposits,developed countries,development\n            banking,development banks,Economic Cooperation,economic\n            development,employment,Equity capital,equity\n            investments,exchange rate,exchange rates,export\n            growth,exports,FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,financial\n            intermediaries,Financial Performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,forecasts,foreign exchange,gas,GDP,gross value,growth\n            potential,housing,imports,income,INDUSTRIAL\n            SECTOR,Industrialization,Inflation,inflation rate,Inflation\n            rates,Insurance,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            banks,International Trade,inventory,iron,labor\n            costs,liquidity,loan financing,Manufacturing\n            Industry,metals,organizational structure,ownership\n            structure,portfolios,price controls,price levels,production\n            efficiency,productivity,rate of exchange,resource\n            mobilization,savings,securities,shareholders,state owned\n            banks,stock exchanges,tax rates,technical assistance,total\n            costs,transport,value added,wages,wholesale price\n            index,working capital"}},"owner":"Private Sector Dev & Finance Grp (MNSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"2753"},"facets":{}}}
