Among the lessons\n            learned are the following:  1) lending can be a powerful\n            instrument even for countries that do not need Bank's\n            financing for immediate balance of payments or budget\n            purposes; 2) An ambitious, complex, and demanding agenda (as\n            in the case of SAC-II) seeking to accomplish extensive\n            behavioral changes in a transition economy in a short period\n            of time necessitates a trusting partnership between the Bank\n            team and the Government's counterparts on the one hand;\n            and on the other, consistency of advice and coordination of\n            efforts amongst multilateral agencies and bilateral donorsl;\n            3) Government ownership of policy reforms is a dynamic\n            concept; it can reinforce itself or dwindle over time also\n            frequent Bank-country dialogue with the continuity and\n            dedication of a well-coordinated country team throughout the\n            tenure of the program helps to reinforce the\n            Government's commitment; and 4) Programmatic assistance\n            (as contemplated by the PRSP process) should not be viewed\n            just as medium-term and time-bound external support.\n            Adjustment operations can play a crucial integrative role in\n            paving the way for sector projects in achieving the\n            necessary high-level decisions and providing the appropriate\n            legal and strategic policy framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -

The credit aims to enhance the Govenrment's\n            ability to manage Azaerbaijan's natural resource boom\n            efficiently, and to stimulate balanced economic growth, job\n            creation, and poverty reduction.

The reform\n            program, supported by the SAC II credit will: 1) improve\n            transparency and accountability in public financial\n            management, including the establishment of the supreme audit\n            institution; 2) strengthen the tracking of poverty-reducing\n            public expenditures, and monitoring of their impact on\n            poverty; 3) improve strategic priority setting and\n            transparency of medium-term public expenditure and\n            investment programs; 4) introduce transparency and financial\n            discipline in the energy sector, including fiscalization of\n            quasi-fiscal activities; 5) reduce conflicts of interest and\n            corruption in the business environment, including regulation\n            enforcement, separation of regulatory and commercial\n            functions, and tax and customs; 6) improve transparency,\n            financial discipline, and competition in the banking sector;\n            and 7) improve the privatization process.
