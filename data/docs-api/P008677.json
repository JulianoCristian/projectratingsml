Some lessons learned included: when the\n            loan disbursement percentage is too low, interest in the\n            borrowing country becomes minimal, as the Bank's\n            requirements for using loan funds are considered not worth\n            the effort. In the wake of macroeconomic improvements in\n            Portugal in the early 1990s the country gained access to\n            non-grant financing sources, which the authorities\n            considered to be preferable to World Bank loan funds. In\n            such an event, early restructuring of the project is\n            desirable. Pre-project analysis, especially in countries\n            nearing \"graduation\" from the Bank, not only\n            should incorporate experience with predecessor projects, but\n            include a review of the entire country portfolio in search\n            of signs for borrowers' changes in handling Bank loams\n            and weakening of their ownership and commitment. Careful\n            review of the likely economics of investments such as\n            irrigation should be made on the basis of models or average\n            figures, prior to contracting detailed design studies, and\n            current Bank practice in this respect should be reviewed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Portugal - Tras-os-montes Regional\n            Development

transformation of agriculture in the Tras-os-Montes region\n            into a smaller sector, and an improvement in regional\n            economy.  The Government's strategy in this period of\n            transition (1986-1996) before Portugal's full accession\n            to the EEC, is to transform agriculture into an efficient\n            and export oriented sector.  The project will assist this\n            strategy in the Tras-Os-Montes region through: (i)\n            strengthening of basic agricultural services (research,\n            extension, and planning); (ii) provision of long term credit\n            for modernization of agroindustries, and replanting of 5,000\n            ha of existing vineyards for port wine; (iii) rehabilitation\n            of 220 small traditional irrigation schemes, and\n            construction of 18 new medium size irrigation schemes;
