While a wider\n            range of issues were addressed under the project, the skill\n            and personnel capacity limitations of the Directorates,\n            particularly in northern areas, appears to have yielded the\n            more modest gains found in the areas of decentralized\n            monitoring, and support to schools, as well as in\n            improvements in learning achievement, as a function of\n            inputs for improved in-service training of teachers and\n            curriculum/textbook reform. There is also the need for more\n            accurate assessment of financial, and time requirement;  for\n            more accurate assessment of institutional capacities; for\n            adequate back-up provisions when inputs are contingent on\n            each other; and, for recognition of collective reinforcement\n            of community development.

The project\n            consists of four main components: 1) improving educational\n            quality by instituting changes in teacher recruitment and\n            training, developing curriculum and educational materials,\n            and developing assessment capacity; 2) increasing equitable\n            access -improving the quantity, physical quality, and gender\n            balance of elementary schools operating in the Northern\n            areas and Azed Jammu and Kashmir by rebuilding dangerous\n            schools and erecting new school buildings for currently\n            shelterless schools; erecting community schools buildings\n            with community participation; and helping to establish a\n            maintenance capacity in each school for receiving\n
