The project area of 420 acres near\n            the beach is that part of the Municipality where, as in\n            Nicosia, the need for a sewerage system is greatest because\n            of population and tourist density and where present disposal\n            methods are creating the greatest problem. The sewerage\n            system would include 7.5 miles of connecting sewers, 18\n            miles of gravity sewers and pressure transmission mains,\n            four pumping stations and a treatment plant. The wastewater\n            produced should be suitable either for irrigation or for\n            discharge to a nearby reservoir to recharge the aquifer."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cyprus - Sewerage and Drainage Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cyprus - Sewerage and Drainage Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1971/03/1556346/cyprus-sewerage-drainage-projects","projn":"CY-Nicosia Sewerage -- P008342,CY-Famagusta Sewerage Sys. -- P008341","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Cyprus","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903181329"},"subsc":"Sewerage","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aquifer,Balance of Payments,Bank\n            loans,cities,Construction,Copper,debt,depreciation,Drainage,Electricity,expenditures,financial\n            stability,fiscal policies,fiscal year,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GNP,Government Finance,Gross National\n            Product,groundwater,Imports,income,Iron,irrigation,labor\n            force,legislation,Market Prices,mining,monetary\n            policies,operating\n            expenses,pipes,piping,plumbing,pollution,Private\n            consumption,property assessments,public debt,Rate of\n            Exchange,redemption,savings,SEWAGE,sewer\n            systems,Sewerage,sewerage systems,sewers,storm water,trunk\n            sewers,waste,waste water,water consumption,water\n            supply,water supply system,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"aquifer,Balance of Payments,Bank\n            loans,cities,Construction,Copper,debt,depreciation,Drainage,Electricity,expenditures,financial\n            stability,fiscal policies,fiscal year,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GNP,Government Finance,Gross National\n            Product,groundwater,Imports,income,Iron,irrigation,labor\n            force,legislation,Market Prices,mining,monetary\n            policies,operating\n            expenses,pipes,piping,plumbing,pollution,Private\n            consumption,property assessments,public debt,Rate of\n            Exchange,redemption,savings,SEWAGE,sewer\n            systems,Sewerage,sewerage systems,sewers,storm water,trunk\n            sewers,waste,waste water,water consumption,water\n            supply,water supply system,working capital"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"P904"},"facets":{}}}
