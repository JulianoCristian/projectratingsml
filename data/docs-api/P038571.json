Several lessons were\n            drawn from the project, the most important are as follows.\n            The simplicity of project design reiterates its value, in\n            that it allowed a quick, and visible impact on the health\n            sector, but at the same time remained consistent with\n            broader reform objectives. Moreover, this simplicity allowed\n            undertaking the large-scale project over half the territory\n            of Russia, in particular, providing the chance for using a\n            single procurement agent, a consolidating, and a forwarding\n            agent, thus easing the Russian Health Care Foundation's\n            performance, which was outstanding in planning, and managing\n            daily operations. Notwithstanding the merit of the selection\n            criterion for less affluent regions, counterpart funding\n            suffered not only because of weak political will to invest\n            in the health sector, but because as it turned out, such\n            regions by and large, had less availability of counterpart\n            funds to provide. Rather, all regions should have been\n            requested to share funding, and then select only those that\n            would have done so. Furthermore, given the objective for a\n            fast disbursement, had guidelines been provided early on to\n            health facilities, better investment decisions would have\n            been made overall. Other lessons address improved\n            procurement practices, particularly as it concerns equipment\n            packaging; balancing the choice between struggling local\n            industries, and the need to ensure quality of supplies and\n            equipment; and, strengthened institutional arrangements to\n            sustain policy reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia -
