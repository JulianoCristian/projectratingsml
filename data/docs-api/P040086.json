The\n            lessons learned indicate that a project design which\n            emphasizes decentralized implementation is crucial for\n            successfully dealing with ethnic and cultural diversity of\n            beneficiaries. The mobilization of labor and capital can be\n            an effective vehicle for promoting local employment and\n            growth. Piloting procedures should speed up the project\n            implementation and improve results. Ensuring that training\n            be given to beneficiary groups will result in a successful\n            implementation of small investment subprojects. Transfer of\n            land in environmentally fragile protected areas may require\n            an accommodating legal framework which confirms the unique\n            access to those land by

improve\n            the quality of life of poor rural indigenous and\n            Afro-Ecuadorian communities by providing improved access to\n            land resources and financing for investment subprojects\n            planned and implemented by local membership organizations\n            and communities. The project components are four. The first\n            strengthens second and third tier indigenous and\n            Afro-Ecuadorian membership organizations in 1) subproject\n            participatory planning, preparation, implementation, and\n            maintenance; 2) financial management and administration; 3)\n            cultural patrimony; and 4) human resources development,\n            including basic legal training. This component focuses on\n            seven small ethnic groups in danger of extinction, and also\n            finances goods and equipment and incremental operating\n            costs. The second component 1) titles and regularizes land\n            tenure rights in productive, forestry, and protected areas;\n            2) purchases land; 3) diagnoses and elaborates an action\n            plan for community-owned irrigation systems; and 4) supports\n            a program of legal reforms. It also strengthens public\n            sector agencies. The third component finances demand-driven\n            small-scale investments in natural resources management;\n            community-based economic infrastructure; social\n            infrastructure; and economic projects and micro-enterprises.\n            The fourth component provides institutional strengthening of\n            the National Council of Indigenous and
