The overall Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, although the implementing agency's\n            capacity was not adequately appraised, thus the overall\n            borrower performance is considered unsatisfactory, based on\n            various associated problems, such as delayed release of\n            funds, lack of commitment to planning objectives, and a\n            continual political interference. The key lessons suggest,\n            primarily, that strengthening of basic institutional\n            capacities need to be prepared, and implemented at the\n            earliest stages of the project cycle, to acquire the\n            procurement capabilities required to support a decentralized\n            government system to fully manage work. In turn, financial\n            autonomy, and timely budget releases become paramount for\n            accountability results to prod a stronger decentralized role\n            in contracting works. Certain force account public works\n            will remain necessary services, for traffic levels do not\n            justify the commercial viability for emergency\n            interventions, but there is a continual commercialization\n            for machinery, and equipment year round, whose privatization\n            should be accelerated. It is suggested stakeholders should\n            be involved as of preparation, and ensure both beneficiary\n            and community participation, to impact effectively, not only\n            on the decentralization process, but on the project as a whole."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal -
