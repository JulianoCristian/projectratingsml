Some lessons\n            learned included: the Bank can maximize its development\n            impact by concentrating its strategic engagement including\n            its lending and advisory support in sectors with track\n            records of success. A well-designed programmatic DPL can be\n            a key instrument in the Bank's long-term engagement.\n            The DPL instrument can leverage the Bank\u2019s strengths on\n            technical advice, convening power, and credibility to help\n            support sector reforms that can have substantial impacts.\n            Prior actions should focus selectively on those reforms that\n            are critical to achieving project objectives but are\n            difficult to undertake because of political or institutional\n            resistance. Prior actions should also ensure that they are\n            additional to what will occur in the absence of the DPL\n            operation. DPLs can achieve good outcomes when they serve as\n            the culmination of a process of engagement, as in the\n            electricity sector in Turkey. A comprehensive yet well\n            integrated set of market reforms can provide credible\n            signals and incentives to private investors. Changing laws\n            and regulations may not have much impact on environmental\n            outcomes when environmental management agencies are weak and\n            lack implementation and enforcement capacity. A Bank DPL may\n            have little additional impact if the design does not fully\n            incorporate the existing political and institutional motivations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

   the borrower being deemed satisfactory as well.

All three\n            intermediate outcome indicators were completely achieved.\n            Significant lessons learned during implementation of the\n            programs include: 1) the use of a Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL) was a strategic choice of instrument after an\n            extensive and substantial engagement of investment lending\n            and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) work in the\n            energy sector; 2) proactive use of the flexibility in the\n            country partnership strategy process and the DPL instrument\n            were very important in order to adapt to both external and\n            internal political economy factors; 3) the flexibility of\n            the DPL instrument was utilized to maximum effect and longer\n            term benefit when the scope of the original energy DPL\n            program was extended to climate change and environmental\n            management in response to the government's readiness to\n            raise the dialogue on these important cross-cutting\n            development themes to a significantly higher level with the\n            international community including the Bank; 4) even with the\n            strongest commitment, sometimes reforms cannot be\n            implemented according to the original schedules; and 5) a\n            DPL that cuts across several themes brings considerable\n            additional complexity in the design but at the same time\n            results in high pay-off as it pursues a more holistic

including climate\n            change considerations, in key sectoral policies and\n            programs. The ESES DPL2 is grounded in the development goals\n            articulated in Turkey's ninth development plan. It\n            supports the governments policies for long-term sustainable\n            growth across the economy and in the energy sector in\n            particular. The ESES DPL2 program continues to support the\n            government program for energy security, energy efficiency,\n            and clean energy first supported under the 2009 Programmatic\n            Electricity Development Policy Loan (PEDPL). At the request\n            of the government, it also includes policies, strategies and\n            specific measures related to climate change and\n            environmental management. The government has concluded the\n            energy efficiency, energuy security, and environmental\n            issues are most effectively addressed in an integrated\n            program. By supporting the government broader sustainable\n            development agenda, the bank scales up its engagement with\n            Turkey on the environment and climate change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
