Ratings for the Land\n            Administration Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Land Fund Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include: the assessed projects make\n            assertions about enhanced tenure security, increased credit\n            access and reduced conflict over land rights but provided no\n            evidence to back these claims up. There is a literature\n            outside the Bank challenging these assumptions and the Bank\n            has only recently begun to take this into account. There are\n            a number of ways to measure tenure security and the progress\n            toward increasing it; and these measures need to be taken\n            into account in project design and monitored during\n            implementation. Summing up, security of land tenure is not\n            automatically boosted by land administration initiatives;\n            good land administration is a necessary (but not sufficient)\n            step toward secure land tenure. EI Salvador-with its single\n            agency-has made more progress toward technical integration\n            than Guatemala with its separate agencies. A unified agency\n            is preferred, if it can be politically established. If a\n            unified agency is not politically feasible, effective\n            arrangements for data integration must be introduced,\n            otherwise the unsatisfactory experience of Guatemala will be\n            repeated in other places. There are steps that can be taken\n            during project design and implementation to make it more\n            likely that integration will be effective. Regularization\n            may be more urgent, more feasible and more sustainable in\n            urban areas and in fertile rural areas with dynamic land\n            markets. Urban regularization could usefully be accompanied\n            by complementary efforts to improve municipal services,\n            municipal financing and slum upgrading. In rural areas,\n            there is more of a need to adopt an integrated approach to\n            land in private property, protected areas and indigenous\n            communities (the last two typically having been orphaned in\n            land administration projects)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -

Lessons within an overall context\n            indicate that although successful in reaching project\n            development objectives, the project - and the Land Fund in\n            general - was able to respond to only a fraction of\n            beneficiaries demand. In fact, except for a FONTIERRAS\n            program on land regularization, the Land Fund became de\n            facto the main instrument of land access facilitation in\n            Guatemala; however, this was not its initial aim.\n            Willing-seller/willing-buyer transactions are only one of a\n            number of policy instruments that should be pursued in\n            addressing problems of inequity in land access, such as in\n            Guatemala. Ideally, conditions should also exist to\n            implement complementary policies, such as regularization of\n            land ownership, land taxation, and similar interventions\n            that would also promote the creation of a dynamic market for\n            land in the country. Concerning the land-access instrument,\n            lessons reinforce that governance and sustainability of\n            participatory \"willing-buyer/willing-seller\"\n            schemes for land access, would benefit from the application\n            of the following principles: a) credit for land purchase is\n            insufficient to increase beneficiaries' incomes and\n            must be complemented with assistance to increase land\n            productivity and, b) beneficiaries should receive a fixed\n            amount of assistance - which could be set on a regional or\n            sub-regional basis. Further lessons focus on Farm-level\n            issues, addressing land distribution and land use systems,\n            on financial management issues, and the need for a\n            computerized Financial Management (FM) system, and at the\n            absence of monitoring and evaluation (M&E), namely,\n            there was no systematic method to assess project impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala -
