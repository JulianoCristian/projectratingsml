The\n            primary objectives of the project were to: (a) support a\n            program of institutional and management improvement in the\n            telecommunications sector; (b) improve the quality of\n            service to existing subscribers and extend the provision of\n            services to meet current and projected demand in the two\n            main economic regions; and (c) improve Office des Postes et\n            Telecommunications du Togo (OPTT) financial performance,\n            with a view to increasing the flow of finds to the Borrower.\n            Bank's performance was highly satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) the government will\n            need to continue and extend, with the participation of all\n            stakeholders, the process of sector reform which it has\n            recently commenced with a view to opening up participation\n            in the sector to new service providers and creating\n            opportunities which are attractive for private investors;\n            (ii) the unstable political and civil situation in the\n            country during 1991 to 1993, the absence of a commercial\n            arms-length relationship between OPTT and the Government and\n            the failure to implement some of the key institutional\n            development components all contributed to the difficulties\n            faced by OPTT; (iii) the project benefitted from new\n            technologies and falling costs during the implementation\n            period; and (iv) those areas of the project which were\n            successfully implemented were facilitated by the continuity\n            and good working relationships between staff in both OPTT\n            and International Development Association (IDA) during the\n            implementation period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Telecommunications Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Telecommunications
