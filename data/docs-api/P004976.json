Despite a difficult environment, physical\n            goals were largely met. Policy changes took place during\n            implementation, which contributed to a successful\n            development, with efficiency gains. Key lessons suggest that\n            separating housing subsidies from housing finance is a key\n            requirement in reforming housing finance. This would not\n            only allow for improvements in the housing finance sector,\n            from the government's perspective, but would provide\n            potentiality for the housing market integration to succeed\n            in financial markets. However, this separation carries risks\n            and may become costly. Within this framework, Treasury bonds\n            were issued to replace an accumulated debt, and the public\n            housing program was then funded through the Budget Law. The\n            risk of the adjustment process was slowed-down by delaying\n            public divestiture from the housing sector. In turn,\n            political and social constraints may delay policy decisions,\n            risking the speed of reforms, particularly when facing\n            claims from a large population, including the middle class.\n            Thus, properly targeted housing subsidies may accelerate\n            reforms, while preserving impoverished populations. However,\n            the success of the project shows that these measures\n            triggered, largely, the housing reform, where the public\n            housing program finance transformed itself into a\n            competitive financial institution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Housing Completion and Sector\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria -

The Social Housing Program\n            for Sale (SHPS) aims at accelerating the completion of about\n            51,000 social units for sale, mostly under Entreprises de\n            Promotion et de Logement Familial's (EPLF) management,\n            through: supply of strategic construction materials (cement,\n            wood and steel rods), finishing products, and small\n            equipment and spare parts.  The private housing program,\n            targeted primarily to self-help builders, aims at assisting\n            the private sector in completing its unfinished housing\n            stock.  It will supply the private sector with strategic\n            construction materials.  The technical assistance component\n            aims at assisting the Government in implementing key housing\n            policy objectives in the following three critical areas:\n            improving the housing supply incentives; reforming housing\n            finance; and reforming and targeting housing subsidies.
