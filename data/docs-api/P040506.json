The\n            lessons learned included: 1) The project reinforces previous\n            experience regarding the importance of maintaining\n            flexibility in project implementation when working in\n            conflict areas; 2) The impact of political factors on the\n            corporatization and commercialization of state-owned\n            enterprises should not be underestimated. This is\n            particularly true when the revenues of the enterprise have\n            previously formed part of the general revenues of the\n            government; 3) Tied co-financing carries special risks,\n            especially if manufacturers in the co-financing country\n            specialize in products that are not technologically\n            compatible with the Borrower's systems; 4) A\n            centralized Project Management Unit would have helped to\n            ensure better co-ordination between the various implementing\n            agencies as well as providing appropriate\n            technical/procurement support mainly in contract management\n            to these agencies; and 5) The high customs duties imposed by\n            Israel on the imported goods have hindered and slow the\n            successful implementation of contracts by the implementing\n            agencies. Such situation has worsened by the reluctance of\n            Israel to give back such levies. This situation is expected\n            to be experienced in future project and therefore should be\n            addressed during future project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza -

for the\n            West Bank and Gaza is to benefit electricity consumers,\n            predominantly households, through sustainable improvements\n            in the quality of electricity supply. There are three main\n            components. The first rehabilitates and upgrades electric\n            utility distribution facilities in the central West Bank and\n            the Hebron governorate, and implements a distribution\n            dispatching center for the Jerusalem District Electric\n            Company (JDEC0). The second component finances a management\n            contract and technical assistance to strengthen sector\n            institutions. It comprises four sub-components: 1) the\n            three-year cost (fixed fees and performance incentive) of a\n            performance-based management contract for the Southern\n            Electric Company; 2) technical assistance to JDECo in areas\n            where its own capacity has potential for improvement; 3)\n            technical assistance to help the municipality of Hebron\n            corporatize and commercialize its electric utility\n            operations (business plan implementation); and 4) technical\n            assistance to the Palestinian Energy Authority to implement\n            the actions specified in the Letter of Sector Development\n            Policy. The third component funds initial startup and\n            operating expenditures, and helps to strengthen both the\n            Hebron and Southern electric companies' capacities to\n            operate as financially sound and technically capable power\n            distribution companies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza -
