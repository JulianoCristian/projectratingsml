The\n            Bank's Board approved the credit on September 24, 1991,\n            but credit signing was postponed indefinitely after the\n            military coup on September 30, 1991 and the subsequent\n            international trade embargo with Haiti. The Bank withdrew\n            the credit on March 1, 1994 following attempts to\n            restructure the project. Funding for preparation work for\n            the project was provided by a Japanese grant and an advance\n            under the IDA's Project Preparation Facility. Some\n            activities financed under these funds were underway at the\n            time of the coup. The Japanese grant supported: (i) studies\n            to support the preparation of the Household Energy\n            component; (ii) work on maintaining, delimiting, and\n            protecting the Pine Forest Reserve; and (iii) preparation of\n            the 1989-93 Management Plan for the Pine Forest Reserve.\n            Under the Project Preparation Facility, the following were\n            executed: (i) work on maintenance, inventories, and\n            surveying; (ii) forest guards and fire fighter crews were\n            hired; and (iii) one of the two scholarships was granted.\n            The major lesson learned is that the activities proposed for\n            the project were and remain vital to Haiti's\n            sustainable economic development, and now to Haiti's\n            immediate reconstruction needs, especially those activities\n            directly targeted to the rural poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Forestry and Environmental\n            Protection Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Forestry and\n            Environmental Protection Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/12/734029/haiti-forestry-environmental-protection-project","projn":"HT-Forstry & Environ -- P007322","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Forestry,Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"Haiti","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007201507"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Forestry","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Agriculture,Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,agroforestry,agroforestry\n            research,crops,degradation,economic development,economic\n            impact,environmental degradation,Environmental\n            Protection,FAO,farmers,farms,Forest,forest guards,forest\n            reserves,Forest Resources,Forestry,Forestry\n            Development,forests,fuels,income,inventories,Mines,natural\n            resource,Natural Resources,Rural Development,Rural\n            Poverty,State forest,State forest lands,sustainable\n            forestry,taxation,timber,timber resources,trees,wood,wood production"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,agroforestry,agroforestry\n            research,crops,degradation,economic development,economic\n            impact,environmental degradation,Environmental\n            Protection,FAO,farmers,farms,Forest,forest guards,forest\n            reserves,Forest Resources,Forestry,Forestry\n            Development,forests,fuels,income,inventories,Mines,natural\n            resource,Natural Resources,Rural Development,Rural\n            Poverty,State forest,State forest lands,sustainable\n            forestry,taxation,timber,timber resources,trees,wood,wood production"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development Dept (LCSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"trustfund":"TF026830-FORESTRY & ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECT/HAITI","repnb":"13816"},"735710":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/09/735710/haiti-forestry-environmental-protection-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/09/735710/haiti-forestry-environmental-protection-project","new_url":"1991/09/735710/haiti-forestry-environmental-protection-project","disclosure_date":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"0015-07-04T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"0015-07-04T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/09/03/000009265_3961001180922/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/09/03/000009265_3961001180922/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"2301","datestored":"1991-09-03T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1991-09-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Forestry and Environmental\n            Protection Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Forestry and\n            Environmental Protection Project is to slow the pace of\n            degradation of Haiti's natural resources by providing\n            technical and financial support for: (a) the institutional\n            strengthening of the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural\n            Resources and Rural Development's Directorate of\n            Natural Resources and its Forestry and Environmental\n            Protection Services, and for training in forestry and\n            agroforestry;
