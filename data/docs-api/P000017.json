It was not realistic\n            to expect that a project, which basically included\n            feasibility and tariff studies, would have an impact on\n            sector efficiency and long-term cost of electricity supply\n            without any follow-up investment. The project was prepared\n            during a period of political turmoil in Togo. It was\n            designed to give the joint power and transmission company\n            (CEB) and the World Bank an instrument to prepare the ground\n            for future investment after the return to normalcy in Togo.\n            Although it was an apt instrument given the circumstances,\n            it could not deliver more than what it was designed to\n            achieve. Project objective benefit has to be assessed in the\n            narrow context of CEB's operations, as well as in the\n            broader context of the two power rehabilitation projects\n            implemented simultaneously in Benin and Togo. In the narrow\n            context, the project outputs are rated as satisfactory given\n            that the project had a substantial impact on institutional\n            development. The studies carried out with the active\n            participation of CEB staff gave them an opportunity to\n            review the merits of options for supplying power to the\n            Benin\\Togo system, and to deepen their understanding of\n            tariff issues. Since institutional development achieved with\n            project assistance is expected to be a lasting improvement,\n            project sustainability is likely. Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory despite the disconnect between project\n            objectives and components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa - Togo/Benin Engineering and\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa -
