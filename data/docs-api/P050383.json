Some lessons\n            learned includes: targeting the poor, vulnerable groups and\n            women can be done effectively in a highly decentralized\n            setting if communities are appropriately mobilized to\n            confirm the status of households; results tend to be better\n            where there is political commitment and where communities\n            have been effectively engaged in decisions regarding program\n            delivery; community determination of interest rates and\n            payback period, while encouraging ownership of revolving\n            fund management, if not well directed can also lead to\n            inappropriate loan products; and while it is possible to\n            provide financial services through many channels, effective\n            and sustainable management of such services requires that\n            they be provided through financial institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Food Security

Ethiopia.\n            Negative environmental impacts and measures to mitigate them\n            are as follows: Arrange periodic inspection and preventive\n            maintenance schedules, construct dykes, and use cut-off\n            drains to reduce flood risks. Use hydrological data to\n            determine riparian rights and the demand for down stream\n            users and conduct training for farmers in water management\n            in order to offset ecological imbalances in downstream and\n            wetland areas. Use appropriate materials, compaction of\n            earht dams and lining of canals and structures, with\n            frequent cleaning and monitoring and maintenance to prevent\n            water leakage. Applying proper soil and water conservation\n            techniques and implementing watershed management action\n            plans will prevent flood hazards caused by delays in the\n            treatment of catchment areas. Poor drainage management that\n            adversely affects the quantity and quality of groundwater\n            may be met by diversifying crops according to market demand.\n            Mono-cropping which leads to pest and disease problems and\n            chemical responses that lead to pollution will be matched by\n            building capacity in the irrigation extension system and\n            training workers in integrated pest management. Refill\n            borrow pits and devise protections against top soil removal,\n            vegetation damage, and water-borne diseases. Place\n            culverts/pipes at short intervals to prevent flooding and\n            erosion.
