Some lessons\n            learned included: the energy assessments prepared under the\n            joint United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and Bank\n            energy sector management assistance program (ESMAP) played a\n            crucial role in the design of both the Energy I project and\n            the Energy II projects. It is important to keep the design\n            of energy projects simple and avoid complex implementation\n            arrangements, even within a single sub-sector. The\n            project's experience in producing briquettes from crop\n            residues had mixed results and did not lead to ongoing\n            productive enterprises. A key element in a successful\n            improved stove dissemination program is to pay detailed\n            attention to producer capabilities, quality control, and\n            consumer preferences. The implementation of viable\n            industrial energy efficiency improvements requires follow-up\n            efforts to train staff and may require the provision of\n            special financing mechanisms to implement them. The\n            project's experience suggests that the private sector\n            is appropriate agent for the production of briquettes from\n            crop wastes. The management of a project such as Energy I,\n            project managers need to devote full time to their project\n            management duties and should not have any other duties in\n            the government, especially during the start-up phase."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Energy I Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Energy I
