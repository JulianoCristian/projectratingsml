Lessons reinforce that the\n            successful implementation of the project is largely due to\n            the effective partnership between the client counterparts,\n            and the Bank, and to the commitment, and dynamic direction\n            of the implementing agency, contributing factors to the\n            excellent disbursement, and timely completion of civil\n            works. This contributed to the development of an efficient\n            construction industry; however, the performance of\n            contractors in the smallest category, continues to be poor.\n            It is thus recommended that future projects consider larger\n            works for small works contracts, based on performance. An\n            area for attention in the roads sector, is that of\n            sustainable maintenance funding, through the establishment\n            of a Roads Fund, linked to user charges, to ultimately set\n            up an independent National Roads Board. Given the recurring\n            annual flooding in Bangladesh, it is recommended that the\n            Government be prepared for such emergencies by ensuring\n            access to critical commodities, and services for immediate\n            rehabilitation works, and a system for periodic maintenance\n            of the road infrastructure would minimize flood damages.\n            Regarding road safety, it is imperative that the Government\n            conduct road safety audits, and implement an action plan\n            involving stakeholders, public-private partnerships,\n            communities, and nongovernmental organizations to commence\n            implementing remedial measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Road Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Road\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/04/1490109/bangladesh-second-road-rehabilitation-maintenance-project","projn":"BD-Second Road Rehabilitation &\n            Maintenance -- P009465","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Business Environment,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Road Safety","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01071304102541"},"subsc":"Roads and highways","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accident prevention,accident\n            reporting,accidents,accounts,adaptation,asphalt,audit\n            reports,audits,Axle Load,bid\n            documents,bridge,bridges,concrete,construction,construction\n            industry,culverts,drainage,employment,expenditure,feasibility\n            studies,feeder roads,framework,generated traffic,Highway\n            Design,Highways,hydrology,Internal Rate of Return,land\n            acquisition,laws,local contractors,narrow roads,National\n            Road Safety,National Road Safety Council,National Roads,Net\n            Present Value,partnership,pavements,periodic\n            maintenance,Police,private sector,procurement,public\n            sector,quality control,reporting,riding quality,road\n            agencies,road conditions,road construction,Road Fund,road\n            infrastructure,road maintenance,Road Materials,road\n            network,road pavement,road planning,Road Rehabilitation,road\n            safety,road safety audit,road safety issues,road safety\n            measures,road system,road traffic,Road Transport,Roads,safer\n            roads,Safety Engineering,safety performance,speed,speed\n            limits,structures,traffic congestion,traffic laws,traffic\n            police,traffic police training,traffic safety,traffic\n            surveys,Transport Authority,transportation,travel\n            time,travel times,trunk roads,user\n            charges,vegetation,vehicle operating costs,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"accident prevention,accident\n            reporting,accidents,accounts,adaptation,asphalt,audit\n            reports,audits,Axle Load,bid\n            documents,bridge,bridges,concrete,construction,construction\n            industry,culverts,drainage,employment,expenditure,feasibility\n            studies,feeder roads,framework,generated traffic,Highway\n            Design,Highways,hydrology,Internal Rate of Return,land\n            acquisition,laws,local contractors,narrow roads,National\n            Road Safety,National Road Safety Council,National Roads,Net\n            Present Value,partnership,pavements,periodic\n            maintenance,Police,private sector,procurement,public\n            sector,quality control,reporting,riding quality,road\n            agencies,road conditions,road construction,Road Fund,road\n            infrastructure,road maintenance,Road Materials,road\n            network,road pavement,road planning,Road Rehabilitation,road\n            safety,road safety audit,road safety issues,road safety\n            measures,road system,road traffic,Road Transport,Roads,safer\n            roads,Safety Engineering,safety performance,speed,speed\n            limits,structures,traffic congestion,traffic laws,traffic\n            police,traffic police training,traffic safety,traffic\n            surveys,Transport Authority,transportation,travel\n            time,travel times,trunk roads,user\n            charges,vegetation,vehicle operating costs,vehicles"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028184-REG.
