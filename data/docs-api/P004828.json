Some lessons learned\n            included: continuity between the teams responsible for\n            project preparation, design, and project implementation can\n            have a major impact on the project start-up. Likewise,\n            continuity in the staff responsible for project oversight,\n            management and implementation is a major contributor to\n            success. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities must\n            be within the capacity of the borrower and may need\n            continuing Bank support over and above the Bank's\n            supervision budgets in the form of institutional development\n            funds or parallel technical assistance grants. Measurement\n            of outcomes related to institutional strengthening and\n            capacity building is a challenge, especially where behavior\n            and attitudinal change underlies the project's\n            objectives. On projects that support large reforms, it is\n            equally difficult to isolate the contribution of the project\n            from that of the broader range of strategies being pursued\n

In this component,\n            system-level planning and coordination are targeted on the\n            central agencies responsible for higher education.\n            Institutional-level planning improvements are targeted to\n            universities and other higher education institutions. The\n            component will also support development of information\n            technology in participating universities and higher\n            education institutions. The second component will provide\n            grants, on a competitive basis, to support quality\n            improvements in selected qualifying higher education\n            institutions and universities. The selected improvement\n            programs will focus on teaching, learning, research, and\n            institutional administration.
