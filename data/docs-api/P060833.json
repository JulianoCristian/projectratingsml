Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) the process and pattern of\n            change in the PSRP1 indicates the critical importance of\n            leadership at different levels of the Government. In\n            retrospect, the design of the reform strategy of the PSRP1\n            was a key factor in subsequent performance. The contextual\n            factors were generally enabling. The relationships with the\n            development partners (DPs) were largely supportive. But what\n            integrated these elements and focused them on productive\n            outcomes was the nature of Tanzanian leadership. 2) A key\n            outcome of the PSRP1 was the capacity development of the\n            President's Office, Public Service Management (PO-PSM),\n            the main Government agency with a mandate to manage\n            system-wide change and reform. One perspective on this\n            process is to disaggregate this emerging capacity into four\n            capabilities, all of which were essential for effective\n            PO-PSM performance. These were the following: a) the\n            capability to carry out technical, managerial and logistical\n            tasks; b) the capability to adapt and change; c) the\n            capability to engage and form relationships with other\n            actors; and d) the capability to achieve greater coherence\n            both internally and externally."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Public Service Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Public Service Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/05/9735955/tanzania-public-service-reform-project","projn":"TZ-Public Serv.

The first and central component, performance\n            improvement, decentralizes and expands key government\n            ministries, departments, and agencies; establishes a core\n            group of strategic planners; trains ministries and build\n            their capacities to implement their plans; strengthens their\n            performance orientation; and provides incentives for\n            performance. The second component obtains private sector\n            participation by continuing the transfer of functions,\n            services, and operations from one institution to another;\n            contracting out non-critical services; divesting and\n            privatizing services and facilities; and redeploying surplus\n            staff. The third component creates and operationalizes\n            executive agencies, isolates select non-policy and executing\n            functions, and introduces client orientation and\n            results-oriented management. The fourth component modernizes\n            information and communication systems, and introduces an\n            integrated computerized personnel and payroll system. The\n            fifth component helps the public service system transform\n            into a meritocracy by developing leadership and management\n            skills, reinstating ethical conduct, and mainstreaming\n            gender issues in to public service activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Public Sector Reform Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Public Sector Reform\n            Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/10/439630/tanzania-public-sector-reform-program-project","projn":"TZ-Public Serv.
