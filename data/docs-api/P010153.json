Both\n            projects suffered a number of shortcomings, from design\n            through implementation. The project period was set too short\n            to implement complex institution-building projects and\n            phasing of substantial construction programs was\n            unrealistic. Little attention was paid to the availability\n            of suitably qualified technical staff and lines of command\n            were not clearly delineated. Administrative and budgetary\n            problems were not properly identified, the availability of\n            relevant technology was ill-assessed, and farmers did not\n            participate in the identification and prioritizing of their\n            perceived problems and needs. Several key lessons can be\n            learned from these projects. First, during the initial years\n            of an extension project, little more can be achieved than\n            the establishment of an administrative framework. Second, a\n            single line of command has to be maintained and management\n            performance monitored in systems operation. Third, a\n            bottom-up approach to extension and research is essential.\n            Fourth, staff have to be provided with adequate incentives\n            to ensure motivation and staff continuity. Lastly, staff\n            recruitment procedures and training require adequate\n            standards to ensure staff quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Agricultural Extension and Food\n

Syanja, and Tanahu, by providing\n            appropriate extension advice and support services for\n            undertaking low-cost farming practices selected to have an\n            immediate impact on food production, better animal health\n            and increased availability of livestock feed. The project\n            also includes provision of fertilizer for the project area.\n            It is expected that the project will reach nearly 50% of the\n            147,000 farm families in the project area. Irrigation works\n            benefitting at least 10,000 farm families and trails and\n            bridges benefitting all the population in these districts\n            will also be upgraded. In view of the remoteness of the\n            project area, there is a risk that all components may not be\n            undertaken effectively and the interrelated services may not\n            be provided; there is also the risk that area farmers may\n            not have access to the development services. The project is\n            therefore designed to minimize the administrative and\n            logistical difficulties of providing services in remote\n            areas through the use of local agricultural service centers.\n            These centers have been found to be effective in other\n            projects in marshalling and directing services and in\n            reaching a broad

- Hill Food Production Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Hill Food Production Project aims to\n            increase food production in four western Hill districts of\n            Gorkha, Lamjung, Syanja, and Tanahu, by providing\n            appropriate extension advice and support services for\n            undertaking low-cost farming practices selected to have an\n            immediate impact on food production, better animal health\n            and increased availability of livestock feed. The project\n            also includes provision of fertilizer for the project area.\n            It is expected that the project will reach nearly 50% of the\n            147,000 farm families in the project area. Irrigation works\n            benefitting at least 10,000 farm families and trails and\n            bridges benefitting all the population in these districts\n            will also be upgraded. In view of the remoteness of the\n            project area, there is a risk that all components may not be\n            undertaken effectively and the interrelated services may not\n            be provided; there is also the risk that area farmers may\n            not have access to the development services. The project is\n            therefore designed to minimize the administrative and\n            logistical difficulties of providing services in remote\n            areas through the use of local agricultural service centers.\n            These centers have been found to be effective in other\n            projects in marshalling and directing services and in\n            reaching a broad spectrum of participants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Hill Food Production Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Hill Food Production
