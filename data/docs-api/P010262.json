The project\n            achieved some of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was partially successful, sustainability is\n            uncertain at this time, and the performance of both the Bank\n            and Borrower was deficient. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, a water right based on an\n            international treaty may be an insufficient guarantee of\n            reliable physical delivery. Second, before embarking on a\n            new stage of a project such as Narayani, the availability of\n            water should be reassessed. Third, participation of\n            beneficiaries in the design, construction, implementation,\n            and O & M is very important in a large public irrigation\n            system where available water resources have to be shared\n            among many beneficiaries in an organized and timely manner.\n            Fourth, the design of a large public irrigation system must\n            be flexible, simple, and socially acceptable to small\n            farmers and their communities. Fifth, service charges to\n            cover full O & M costs of public utilities after\n            improvement must be imposed and should be considered a\n            country-wide issue in any investment project. Sixth, regular\n            evaluation of project impact on beneficiaries is more likely\n            to be successful when the work is carried out by independent\n            consultants rather than by project staff. Finally, public\n            and government awareness of proper utilization of natural\n            resources must be developed through various means of\n            investment lending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Third Narayani Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Third Narayani Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/05/733538/nepal-third-narayani-irrigation-project","projn":"NP-Narayani III (Consol -- P010262","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961214134536"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,availability of water,available water,available\n            water resources,canals,cash flows,channels,collection of\n            water,construction,Cost Recovery,crop production,crop\n            yields,cubic meter,cubic meters,discharge,distribution of\n            water,distribution system,drainage,drainage system,drainage\n            systems,embankments,farmers,flood control,Flood Damage,flood\n            damages,Flood Protection,floods,groundwater,groundwater\n            development,groundwater irrigation,investment\n            project,Irrigation Development,irrigation systems,irrigation\n            water,irrigation water supply,natural resources,Performance\n            Indicators,project management,public utilities,river\n            water,Rivers,service delivery,streams,supply of\n            water,town,Water Availability,water charges,water\n            distribution,water distribution system,water levels,water\n            resources,water service,water supplies,Water Supply,water\n            system,Water User,Water Users,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,availability of water,available water,available\n            water resources,canals,cash flows,channels,collection of\n            water,construction,Cost Recovery,crop production,crop\n            yields,cubic meter,cubic meters,discharge,distribution of\n            water,distribution system,drainage,drainage system,drainage\n            systems,embankments,farmers,flood control,Flood Damage,flood\n            damages,Flood Protection,floods,groundwater,groundwater\n            development,groundwater irrigation,investment\n            project,Irrigation Development,irrigation systems,irrigation\n            water,irrigation water supply,natural resources,Performance\n            Indicators,project management,public utilities,river\n            water,Rivers,service delivery,streams,supply of\n            water,town,Water Availability,water charges,water\n            distribution,water distribution system,water levels,water\n            resources,water service,water supplies,Water Supply,water\n            system,Water User,Water Users,wells"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"15606"},"741970":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1986/06/741970/nepal-third-narayani-irrigation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1986/06/741970/nepal-third-narayani-irrigation-project","new_url":"1986/06/741970/nepal-third-narayani-irrigation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1986/06/01/000009265_3970625092726/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1986/06/01/000009265_3970625092726/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1715","datestored":"1986-06-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1986-06-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Third Narayani Irrigation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objectives of the Third\n            Narayani Irrigation Project are to increase dry-season\n            agricultural production and reduce the risks to monsoon crop\n            production by introducing an equitable, predictable and\n            reliable irrigation system in the Narayani irrigation\n            scheme.
