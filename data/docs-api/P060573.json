Some lessons learned included:\n            political cycles had a clear impact on the rhythm of\n            implementation of the Project. This challenge is amplified\n            in multi-sector operations given the larger number of\n            entities involved in implementation. To address this\n            challenge, Projects should try to limit the number of\n            entities, recognize the risk or factor in political\n            variables in Project design. Moreover, the distribution of\n            Bank and counterpart financing should take into account\n            incentives or disincentives at political levels, as was the\n            case under this operation, to ensure that activities with\n            lower political visibility are still undertaken in a timely\n            fashion. Although multiple institutions and stakeholders are\n            involved in multi-sector operations, projects should design\n            some degree of centralization under a unified Project\n            Implementation Unit to make complex operations more\n            manageable and expedite implementation, particularly to\n            facilitate multiple procurement processes. From the\n            Bank's perspective, these multi-sector operations that\n            involve numerous activities and procurement processes\n            inevitably rely on strengthened and intensified Bank\n            supervision. A long term lesson learned through past Bank\n            experiences in the State is the need to move beyond narrow\n            approaches to improving accessibility (focusing on trunk\n            infrastructure or isolated interventions on municipal\n            roads), and adopting a more integrated approach both\n            vertically, within the road network to link various road\n            levels to provide seamless logistics, and horizontally among\n            various other regional development requirements. This\n            'holistic' approach, which is inherently more\n            complex to implement, and to which the new proposed\n            operation is ultimately responding, relies on strong\n            coordination between the different Government levels,\n            ensuring that micro interventions at local level are\n            supplemented by investments undertaken at regional and\n            national level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Tocantins Sustainable Regional\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Tocantins Sustainable\n

to\n            raising living standards and to reducing inequalities and\n            regional disparities in Brazil by improving access to\n            markets, job opportunities, infrastructure and social\n            services for rural communities in Tocantins' poorest\n            regions, while ensuring sustainable use of natural resources\n            and the protection of fragile ecosystems. The project is\n            comprised of three components.  The participatory planning\n            and management of regional and municipal development\n            component will establish or strengthen mechanisms for local\n            civil society participation; set up regional units of\n            SEPLAN; and strengthen capacity to undertake multisectoral\n            state-level planning, to administer public programs, and\n            monitor/evaluate the performance of such programs. The\n            environmental management component will: strengthen land\n            management capacity; consolidate the environmental\n            protection system; and support the regulation and promotion\n            of sustainable land use.  The rural transport improvement\n            component will: (a) strengthen road management capacity, by\n            ensuring the preparation, monitoring and evaluation of\n            efficient state road programs, and gradually increasing the\n            road maintenance capacity; (b) define and improve about\n            6,000 km of priority road sections of the main municipal\n            road networks and improve about 120 km of high-priority\n            state feeder roads including reconstruction of bridges and\n            culverts, rehabilitation of road surfaces and bases, and\n            paving; (c) promote cost-effective rural transport services,\n            particularly school bus systems, and establish mechanisms to\n            improve access of the rural poor to such services; and (d)\n            provide support to the project coordination unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Tocantins Sustainable Regional\n            Development

Tocantins Rural Infrastructure\n            Project seeks to improve traffic conditions, and\n            transportation costs, to in turn further consolidate the\n            policy on appropriate uses of the State's natural\n            resources. In light of the project's impending road\n            construction, this Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) reviews the\n            Constitution's articles relevant to indigenous peoples\n            rights, as well as the Regulation of the Indigenous National\n            Foundation (FUNAI) (Annexes I and II), to establish\n            procedures for project implementation, avoiding as possible,\n            or minimizing, adverse impacts on the lives of indigenous\n            populations. It is noted that legislation stipulates a\n            radius of ten kilometers should protect indigenous reserves,\n            and, activities potentially endangering biodiversity, should\n            abide by the norms set by the National Council for the\n            Environment (CONAMA). However, taking into consideration the\n            above mentioned laws and regulations, an environmental\n            assessment on various alternatives, comparative analyses for\n            the design of road networks, and local consultations, the\n            alternative proposed states that, the new road segment\n            traversing indigenous land, would provide the opportunity\n            for land restoration of vast areas previously subjected to\n            agricultural, and livestock practices, and, its proximity to\n            the city of Nazare - currently isolated - would provide\n            positive social, and economic benefits to the region."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brasil - Projeto de Infra-estrutura Rural a\n            Tocantins : diretrizes basicas para o desenvolvimento dos\n            povos indigenas no ambito das obras rodoviarias"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brasil - Projeto de\n            Infra-estrutura Rural a Tocantins : diretrizes basicas para\n            o desenvolvimento dos povos indigenas no ambito das obras rodoviarias"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/10/2063248/brasil-projeto-de-infra-estrutura-rural-tocantins-diretrizes-basicas-para-o-desenvolvimento-dos-povos-indigenas-no-ambito-das-obras-rodoviarias","projn":"BR-Tocantins Sustainable Regional\n            Development Project -- P060573","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","count":"Brazil","authors":{"authr":"Governo do Tocantins"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02112104074481"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Roads and highways,General public administration sector,Sub-national government administration","lang":"Portuguese","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Indigenous peoples land tenure; Indigenous\n            rights; Road construction; Road construction environmental\n            aspects; Site planning; Environmental law & legislation;\n            Comparative analysis; Land restoration; Socioeconomic\n            benefits; Land rights"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"IPP25","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Tocantins Sustainable Regional\n            Development Project : indigenous peoples plan"}}},"facets":{}}}
