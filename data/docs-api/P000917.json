The key lessons learned include: 1)\n            In a large project, it is important to contract out\n            peripheral elements so that the staff of the implementing\n            agency can focus on the primary project goals. 2)\n            Large-scale projects require high levels of political\n            support and commitments as well as strong participation at\n            the grassroots level both by the communities and their\n            leaders. 3) Strong and stable leadership of the top project\n            management is key to providing direction, guidance, and\n            support to staff. 4) The project must be designed to be\n            flexible and responsive to the needs and perceptions of the\n            learners. 5) The project can play an important role in the\n            community by incorporating development activities into the\n            regular class schedule and involving learners in related\n            schemes for improving the local community. 6) For Ghana to\n            eradicate illiteracy, the formal and non-formal education\n            sectors must ensure that their respective programs are\n            cost-effective and of high quality. Also, the implementing\n            agency can provide non-governmental providers of literacy\n            services with technical assistance and teaching materials.\n            7) Literacy instruction is more likely to be effective and\n            to sustain participants' motivation when it is clear to\n            the learners that being literate will improve their daily\n            lives. 8) Literacy interventions need to be continually\n            monitored to ensure that they are effective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Literacy and Functional Skills

The project's main objective is to improve\n            the quality of life of the poorest Ghanaians, especially\n            those in the rural areas.  Credit funds will be used to\n            finance the production of printed materials; procurement of\n            radios, bicycles, and sewing machines as incentives for\n            facilitators and supervisors; procurement of development\n            inputs, vehicles and office furniture and equipment; staff\n            training and technical assistance; and the construction of\n            office and storage facilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
