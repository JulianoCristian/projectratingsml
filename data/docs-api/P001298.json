goods and some consumer goods; (2) reduced\n            dispersion in tariff rates; (3) decontrolling prices of\n            about 20 products and streamlining approval proccedures for\n            goods remaining under price control; (4) improved incentives\n            for export promotion, including manufacturing in bond,\n            export finance, and a new import duty compensation scheme;\n            (5) streamlining of investment procedures; (6) improved tax\n            incentives for investment; (7) the development of an action\n            program for restructuring the
