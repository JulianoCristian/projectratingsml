The request was submitted by Mr. Abdelkader Ali\n            Abdallah and Mr. Yahya Saleh Mohsen, both residents of\n            Sana'a, Yemen, on their behalf and on behalf of the\n            Yemen Observatory for Human Rights, a local Non-Governmental\n            Organization. The request claims, inter alia, that the Bank\n            failed to comply with principles of transparency and\n            disclosure of information with respect to a development\n            policy operation for institutional reform in Yemen, which\n            they contend will produce negative effects on wages,\n            employment and poverty reduction. The panel registered the\n            request on April 20, 2009. On May 19, 2009, Management\n            submitted its response to the request for inspection, which\n            includes an action plan \"to follow-up on the issues\n            raised by the requesters.\" Management stated that it\n            agrees with the Requesters on the importance of partnership\n            with stakeholders as a substantial factor to achieve\n            sustainable development and to improve transparency and\n            accountability in development. Management stated that it is\n            satisfied that the requirement under OP 8.60 which requires\n            the Bank to \"advise borrowing countries to consult with\n            and engage the participation of key stakeholders\" was\n            met. As for the social impact of measures supported under\n            the IRDPG, Management stated that the measures supported\n            under the IRDPG are expected to have a positive social and\n            poverty impact. The Requesters raised some concerns and\n            questions regarding the feedback to civil society\n            organizations on the outcome of various consultative\n            processes. They welcomed the opportunity to participate in\n            discussions pertaining to the design of a second phase of\n            the Program, especially regarding its impacts on the poorer\n            segments of society. The panel has informed Management of\n            the Requesters' concerns and questions, and after\n            receiving concurrence from the Requesters, has shared their\n            written feedback with Management. On September 8, 2010,\n            Management sent the panel its response to these concerns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Institutional Reform Development\n            Policy Grant Project : request for inspection"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Institutional Reform\n            Development Policy Grant Project : request for inspection"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/09/12756387/yemen-institutional-reform-development-policy-grant-project-request-inspection","projn":"RY-Institutional Reform Development Policy\n            Grant -- P101453","docty":"Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Banks & Banking Reform,Social Accountability,Corporate Law,Parliamentary Government","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Social Development,Law and Development,Governance,Public Sector Development","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100914021540"},"subsc":"Central government administration,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Social Development,Law and Development,Governance,Public Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information, accountability,\n            affected parties, Anti-Corruption, banks, beneficiaries,\n            best practices, Board meeting, capacity building, civil\n            servants, civil service, civil society, Civil Society\n            Organization, civil society organizations, civil society\n            participation, Community Scorecards, complaints,\n            constituencies, consultation, consultation processes,\n            consultations, employment, ex post, Extractive Industries,\n            finance management, Financial Management, Governmental\n            Organization, Human Rights, individuals, Initiative,\n            Institutional Reform, institutional strengthening,\n            International Development, investigation, legislation,\n            limited, local Authorities, Managers, mandates, Minister,\n            natural resources, negotiations, Non-Governmental\n            Organization, outreach, Parliament, Parliamentary processes,\n            participation of stakeholders, participatory monitoring,\n            participatory process, participatory processes, partnership,\n            persons, policy issues, poverty reduction, preparation,\n            Prime Minister, procurement, project design, public finance,\n            public service, Reconstruction, reflection, representatives,\n            retirement, severance payments, Social Welfare, Stakeholder,\n            stakeholders, taxation, transparency, Urban Development, wages"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduct & Econ.

The request was submitted by Mr. Abdelkader\n            Ali Abdallah and Mr. Yahya Saleh Mohsen, both residents of\n            Sana'a, Yemen, on their behalf and on behalf of the\n            Yemen observatory for human rights, a local non-governmental\n            organization (NGO). The request claims, inter alia, that the\n            Bank failed to comply with principles of transparency and\n            disclosure of information with respect to a development\n            policy operation for institutional reform in Yemen, which\n            they contend will produce negative effects on wages,\n            employment and poverty reduction. The panel registered the\n            request on April 20, 2009 and management submitted its\n            response on May 19, 2009. The panel observes that the\n            Requesters raise three main issues in relation to the\n            Bank's obligations as per requirements related to\n            consultation and participation in the relevant policies.\n            Firstly, the Bank was not forthcoming when the Requesters\n            asked for a copy of the program document (PD) in Arabic.\n            Secondly, the Requesters asserted that the preparation\n            process of the IRDPG did not give civil society\n            organizations and other non-governmental stakeholder's\n            adequate opportunities to debate and potentially influence\n            the design of the project supported by the grant. Thirdly,\n            they allege that the reforms listed in the project will not\n            be beneficial, arguing that important elements of it are\n            likely to result in increased levels of poverty, with\n            reference in particular to the removal of fuel subsidies and\n            a possible increase in taxes as a result of the proposed\n            income tax reforms. The panel recommends that the Board of\n            Executive Directors approves an investigation into the\n            matters raised in the request for inspection. Considering\n            that management has provided a translation into Arabic of\n            the program document and thus resolved that issue, the\n            investigation will not focus on this matter."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Institutional Reform Development\n            Policy Grant Project : inspection panel report and\n            recommendation on a request for

It emphasizes two key elements: 1)\n            Supporting non-oil growth through investment climate reforms\n            through: a) Rationalizing the incentive framework (by\n            harmonizing treatment of income, expenses and investment\n            with international standards); b) Strengthening property\n            rights (by reducing ambiguity of land titling and improving\n            public management of land registration); and 2)\n            Strengthening governance and public financial management\n            through: a) Reforming procurement as part of public\n            financial management reforms to increase transparency and\n            accountability and to separate the policy-making functions\n            from the administrative function; b) Supporting the public\n            administration reform strategy, in particular through wage\n            policy, retrenchments and a biometric database on public\n            employees as part of broader civil service reform; and c)\n            Increasing revenue transparency through Yemen's\n            accession to the Extractive Industries Transparency\n            Initiative (EITI).
