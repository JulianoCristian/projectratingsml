There are three components to the project.\n            The first component is the protected area development. This\n            component will support PA management plans, operations,\n            assessments, and facilities development in existing and new\n            PAs. There are two subcomponents to the project. The first\n            subcomponent  is the PA management planning. The project\n            will finance development and implementation of new PA plans\n            for the two existing National Parks (NPs) Sutjeska and\n            Kozara, for the existing Janj and Lom forest reserves and\n            for the new National Parks (NPs) in Una River and\n            Igman-Bjelasnica-Treskavica-Visocica mountain complex\n            (IBTV). The second subcomponent is the ecological and PA\n            management assessment. The project will establish a\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system for both the PAs\n            and the project. This will include support for the\n            ecological assessments to be used as inputs to the PA\n            management planning and decision-making as well as for\n            subsequent monitoring of biodiversity status including\n            tracking of key habitats and species. The second component\n            is the capacity and support for biodiversity conservation.\n            This component will focus on strengthening the institutions\n            responsible for planning, establishment, and management of\n            PAs. Finally, the third component is the local initiatives\n            in biodiversity conservation. The project will support\n            biodiversity conservation efforts by local stakeholders\n            which promote improved natural resource management and\n            generate economic benefits to local communities involved in\n            protected areas management. To be eligible, subprojects must\n            be able to demonstrate that they will mitigate the\n            significant threats to global biodiversity or contribute to\n            monitoring of such biodiversity, and include arrangements to\n            assess their impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

Component 1 aims at\n            accelerating the implementation of new legal, institutional\n            and economic frameworks. New legal and institutional\n            frameworks, will support the setting of a forest management\n            regime, ensuring the sustainable use, and protection of\n            forest resources, while at the same time pave the way to an\n            autonomous, and self-financing forest sector. Supporting the\n            sector's institutional reforms will assist in work\n            implementation, to support the establishment of the newly\n            created Forest Offices. Technical assistance, and training\n            will be focused on establishing a forest management,\n            financial monitoring system, and basic office equipment, to\n            enable communication, and coordination; and, in addition,\n            operational support will be provided to forest guards, and\n            inspectors, as well as for procurement of, and training in\n            the use of field equipment to ensure compliance with the new\n            forest law, improve transparency, and forest governance.\n            Component 2, Strengthening of Technical Capacity for\n            Sustainable Forest Management, will facilitate the\n            implementation of economically environmentally, sound forest\n            management, and, will set up technical instruments, critical\n            to ensure monitoring and sustainable uses of forest\n            endowment, forest management and forest certification.\n            Component 3, Promoting Biodiversity and Forest Conservation,\n            will address, and respond to the governments commitments, in\n            leveraging the country's biodiversity into protected\n            areas. Component 4, Project implementation, Monitoring and\n            Evaluation, will be managed by two small Project\n            Implementation Units (PIUs), responsible for forestry during\n
