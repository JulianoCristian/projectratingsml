The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            regarded as satisfactory. General lessons highlighted from\n            this project include these: 1) Some Bank rules prevent\n            public institutions from participating in bidding, thus\n            limiting the pool of qualified organizations which could\n            contribute to the realization of projects. 2) The Bank\n            should avoid granting short closing date extensions, as this\n            approach is counterproductive for project operations.\n            Project-specific lessons noted were these: 1) An effective\n            outreach program is key to reaching potential beneficiaries\n            in the informal sector. 2) Special attention should be given\n            to the choice of training sponsors. To that end,\n            institutional sponsors and enterprises should be given\n            priority. 3) The project demonstrated that craftsmen did not\n            respond very well to demands for training. It is, thus,\n            necessary to work with their associations to sensitize\n            craftsmen on the role they can play as trainers for the\n            less-skilled labor force and to provide additional\n            incentives. 4) Allocation of public funds on a competitive\n            basis (i.e., with public vocational training institutes\n            competing with private institutions) can reduce costs and\n            increase responsiveness of public spending on skills\n            development. 5) Lack of complementary inputs (water, credit,\n            equipment, markets) tend to limit the impact on\n            beneficiaries. This suggests the needs to link subprojects\n            better with other projects and interventions.\" 6)\n            Existence of accountability mechanisms for a Fund would\n            enhance its efficiency. Lessons pertaining to the research\n            agency for employment promotion (AGEPE) included: 1)\n            Organizations like the Observatory must have enough autonomy\n            to avoid the sclerosis of the bureaucracy and enough\n            influence to get information it requires from others. 2)\n            Successfully building organizational capacity requires a\n            careful analysis of incentives, such as financial incentives\n            for competent staff to join, stay and be productive in the\n            organization. It should also examine incentives to establish\n            networks and linkages across organizational borders\".\n            3) One major weakness that impeded the performance of the\n            Observatory was the limited human capacity available for\n            labor market analysis. A lesson to be learned is that\n            building an institution like the Observatory requires a long\n            commitment of time and effort. 4) Although Observatories\n            seem to have failed in may African countries, these\n            organizations are still relevant, especially as there are no\n            think tanks in those countries. Their success will depend on\n            a careful design as advised above and on the dissemination\n            strategy put in place."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Labor Force Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire -
