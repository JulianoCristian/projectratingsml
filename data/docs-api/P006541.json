The ratings for the\n            Espirito Santo Water Coastal Pollution Management Project\n            were as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory;\n            sustainability was likely; institutional development impact\n            was negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned included: (i) the importance of treating the\n            institutional and environmental objectives as long term\n            program areas, rather than projects, and this requires\n            persistence, patience, and follow up by the Bank; (ii) that\n            integrated approaches work well, for the most part, with low\n            income settlements; (iii) that the hybrid approach\n            represents a useful model for Brazil and elsewhere; and (iv)\n            that metropolitan planning in Brazil requires urgent\n            attention. One of the richest lessons from this assessment,\n            finally, concerns the perceptions and judgments of high\n            level professionals who managed the course of project\n            implementation.

In the 1990s the World Bank decided to support\n            the state of Sao Paulo with a project that sought to\n            guarantee the Guarapiranga reservoir as a reliable water\n            source, capable of supplying some 3 million people in the\n            metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The project provided 8,050\n            new connections to the existing sewerage system and 41,000\n            connections prepared for the new sewerage system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Improving water supply and sanitation in Sao Paulo"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Improving water supply and\n            sanitation in Sao Paulo"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2005/12/24013816/improving-water-supply-sanitation-sao-paulo","count":"Brazil","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"employment, environmental conservation,\n            housing, land use, Pollution, Pollution Control, river\n            basin, Sanitation, sewerage system, slums, solid waste,\n            solid waste collection, solid waste management, State Water\n            Company, urban areas, Urban Development, Water Quality,\n            water reservoir, water source, water sources, Water Supply"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Environment and natural resource management,Public sector governance","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Mejorar el abastecimiento de agua y el\n            saneamiento de Sao Paulo"}},"topic":"Water and Sanitation Law and Regulation\n            m1327713 1874,Water, Sanitation and Hygiene m1326125 1462,Water Pollution m1327598 1798,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Supply m1326961 138","projn":"BR-Water Quality And Pollution Control\n            Project -- P006541","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Slums Upgrading,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Urban Services to the Poor,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Development,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150218092526"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","theme":"Water resource management,Pollution management and environmental health,Other social development,Environmental policies and institutions,Decentralization","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Development,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Water and Sanitation Law and Regulation\n            m1327713 1874,Water, Sanitation and Hygiene m1326125 1462,Water Pollution m1327598 1798,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199,Water Supply m1326961 138","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["A"],"trustfund":"TF035686-ARGENTINA - WATER AND SANITATION","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"92577"},"4689997":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/06/4689997/brazil-water-quality-pollution-control-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/06/4689997/brazil-water-quality-pollution-control-project","new_url":"2004/06/4689997/brazil-water-quality-pollution-control-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/07/02/000012009_20040702125122/Rendered/INDEX/28962.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/07/02/000012009_20040702125122/Rendered/PDF/28962.pdf","loan_no":"3503;3504;3505","docdt":"2004-06-25T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2004-07-02T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Water Quality and Pollution\n            Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Overall, the project shows a\n            satisfactory outcome, likely sustainability, and high\n            institutional development impacts. The integrated approach\n            to water quality management - water supply and sanitation\n            services, urban upgrading and other basic needs at the local\n            levels - is based on multi-sectoral, and inter-institutional\n            principles, and is inherently complex. Despite successes,\n            and notwithstanding the Bank's 1993 Water Resources\n            Policy Paper acknowledging the need for comprehensive water\n            resources, planning and management at the river basin level\n            (though warning of its difficulties), and the 2003 Water\n            Resources Sector Strategy endorsing pragmatic approaches to\n            policy reform, in recognition of the political economy of\n            changes, difficulties still persist in inter-municipal and\n            state-municipal cooperation, and coordination to control\n            pollution in highly urbanized river basins. In the final\n            analysis, problems related to water quality management,\n            pollution control, the environment, and urban upgrading,\n            remain complex - both institutionally and in terms of the\n            interactions between land uses, infrastructure, pollution,\n            and the resulting water quality - which cannot be resolved\n            with simple approaches, or isolated sector interventions.\n            This experience  demonstrates that a fundamental element of\n            such urban water management projects, is the concomitant\n            concern with addressing urban poverty and quality of life.\n            In response, quality assurance sought to demonstrate an\n            approach for comprehensive planning, and management that\n            could help overcome the difficulties of coordination, and\n            how to achieve effective integration, while demonstrating\n            the importance of using the river basin, and sub-basins,\n            and, it confirmed that comprehensive urban water resources,\n            land-use planning and management, is feasible although\n            complex, time consuming, and subject to political risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
