Second, their administrative\n            and managerial accountability must be developed. Finally,\n            the State must divest of activities that could be more\n            effectively carried out by the private sector. It is\n            expected that this project would enhance the productivity of\n            public enterprises, reduce their dependence on scarce\n            budgetary resources, and rationalize the
