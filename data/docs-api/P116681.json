The project\n            development objective indicators as well as the intermediate\n            outcome indicators were achieved completely, and in some\n            cases, had even exceeded the target. Significant lessons\n            learned during the course of implementing the project are:\n            1) projects that are simple in design and singularly focused\n            perform well and have a high likelihood of achieving their\n            objectives; 2) addressing priority needs of local\n            populations is critical for the successful implementation of\n            rural development projects; 3) irrigation projects can\n            provide an important safety net for rural populations,\n            especially during times of economic downturn; 4) projects\n            prepared rapidly must have in-built flexibility to respond\n            to emerging needs and situations; and 5) establishing and\n            strengthening Water User Associations (WUAs) is a

farmers. Instead of growing wheat or barley,\n            thousands of the country's small farmers have been\n            planting crops that need more water but ultimately yield\n            more cash. The transformation comes thanks to investments\n            supported by the World Bank over many years in the\n            country's irrigation and water rights systems.\n            Investments have also been made in building new, gravity-fed\n            irrigation systems that do not need pumps and save a lot of\n            money on fuel, almost $ 35 million. As the global financial\n            crisis hit, the World Bank invested emergency funds for\n            renovation of around 90 km of sections of the main Armavir\n            and Talin, helping to create 12,000 temporary jobs. As a\n            result, water losses in two important main canals have\n            reduced from almost 23 percent to 7 percent. That allows\n            7,000 more hectares to be irrigated. A follow-up project has\n            already been topped up so that more canals in six provinces\n            can be repaired, encouraging further agricultural\n            development and the possibility of increased incomes for\n            Armenia's farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"The new landscape of Armenia's agriculture"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"The new landscape of\n            Armenia's agriculture"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/05/24428494/new-landscape-armenias-agriculture","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water users associations, pumping,\n            water management, irrigation systems, water projects, water\n            needs, irrigation, wua, water user, transparency, irrigation\n            networks, meters, orchards, water users, water resource\n            management, irrigation rehabilitation, dams, irrigation\n            infrastructure, pumps, access to irrigation, agricultural\n            development, water, canals, programs, water resource,\n            irrigation development, reservoirs, water fees, irrigation\n            water, farmers, irrigation canals, water losses, bilateral\n            agreement, pumping stations, water rights, gravity, artesian wells"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","projn":"AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency\n            Project -- P116681,AM-Additional Financing To Irep -- P126509,AM-Irrigation Development Additional\n            Financing -- P105171,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety 2 Project -- P088499,AM-Irrigation Development Project -- P055022,AM-Irrigation Dam Safety -- P064879,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Project -- P008277","topic":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Water Use,Irrigation and Drainage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b082e1d99d_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management,Rural policies and institutions,Other social protection and risk management,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Natural disaster management,Rural services and infrastructure,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Agricultural Laws and Regulations m1327358 171,Agricultural Credit m1327605 1962","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF025793-PHRD-IRRIGATION DEVELOPMENT,BBFAO-BB FAO,TF029549-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT\n            SERVICES PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF036016-ECA REGION - WATER AND\n            AGRICULTURE (ARMENIA, UZBEKISTAN),BBFAO-BB FAO,TF032683-ARMENIA - IRRIGATION\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF031092-ARMENIA IRRIGATION REHABILITATION,TF033283-ECA REGION (LITHUANIA AND\n            LATVIA) AGRICULTURE DEV.

As a result of sustained growth,\n            ambitious reforms, and external inflows of capital and\n            remittances, poverty plunged from over 55 percent at the\n            start of the transition to less than 36 percent in 2010."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Laying the foundations for\n            sustainable development"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Laying the foundations\n            for sustainable development"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/23160843/armenia-laying-foundations-sustainable-development","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture, Bank office, Bank portfolio,\n            banking system, beneficiaries, capital needs, cash transfer,\n            crises, Development Bank, development policy, Development\n            Project, Development Strategy, economic crisis, equipment,\n            exchange rate, financial crisis, financial stability, fiscal\n            consolidation, forests, Foundations, gross domestic product,\n            households, human capital, human capital development, IBRD,\n            IMF, income, inflows of capital, International Bank,\n            International Development, investment climate, Investment\n            Fund, investment projects, liquidity, local currency,\n            meetings, micro borrowers, middle-income country,\n            Modernization, Monetary Fund, Nations, natural disasters,\n            natural resources, pensions, Poverty Reduction, priorities,\n            Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, remittances, road, Roads,\n            rural areas, rural communities, rural development, Social\n            Investment, social protection, solvency, supervision,\n            sustainability, Sustainable Development, targeting, tax,\n            Trust Funds, UNDP, United Nations Development Programme,\n            working capital"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Human development,Environment and natural resource management,Social protection and risk management,Public sector governance,Rural development,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Fiscal Sustainability m1326901 1097,Sustainable Growth m1326464 1100,Macroeconomic Sustainability m1326465 1096,Regional Aid m1326984 2110,Inclusive Innovation m1326081 400","projn":"AM-Health Systems Modernization Project -- P073974,AM-Urban Heating Project -- P057880,AM-Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency\n            Project -- P116681,AM-Health System Modernization Project\n            (Apl2) In Support Of The Se -- P104467","subtopic":"Development Economics & Aid Effectiveness,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Regional Rural Development,Emerging Markets,Debt Markets","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150105134709"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General education sector,Compulsory health finance,Tertiary education,Health,Central government administration,Public administration- Agriculture, fishing\n            and forestry,Irrigation and drainage,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Housing construction,General energy sector","theme":"City-wide Infrastructure and Service Delivery,Other Financial Sector Development,Pollution management and environmental health,Regulation and competition policy,Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services,Rural services and infrastructure,Administrative and civil service reform,Education for the knowledge economy,Health system performance,Injuries and non-communicable diseases,HIV/AIDS,Tuberculosis,Urban services and housing for the poor","colti":"IBRD results","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Fiscal Sustainability m1326901 1097,Sustainable Growth m1326464 1100,Macroeconomic Sustainability m1326465 1096,Regional Aid m1326984 2110,Inclusive Innovation m1326081 400","owner":"Energy & Extractives - GP (GEEDR),Water - GP (GWADR),Health, Nutr & Population - GP (GHNDR)","Environmental Category":["F","B"],"trustfund":"TF025128-PHRD-POWER & GAS\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF025754-PHRD: POWER & GAS\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJ.
