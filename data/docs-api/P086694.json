Energy\n            Market (SEEREM) Project, supports the countries of South\n            East Europe, and Kosovo, in the implementation of their\n            electric power sector commitments, under the Athens process.\n            The Bank's standard environmental requirements will\n            apply to projects supported under this Adaptable Program\n            Loan (APL) program. An environmental management plan\n            acceptable to the Bank would have to be finalized, and\n            disclosed in the country, prior to project appraisal of\n            category B projects. More comprehensive environmental impact\n            assessments would be required for category A projects. While\n            most projects to be financed under the program, are expected\n            to be category B projects, some generation renovation\n            projects however, might receive category A ratings. This\n            environmental management plan addresses in particular, the\n            potential environmental adversity due to the equipment\n            refurbishment of Lotru - Ciunget HPS, and offers mitigation\n            measures as follows. To prevent and avoid oil and lubricant\n            spills, used oils will be temporarily stored in buffer\n            tanks, to be then loaded into tank trucks, and transported\n            by authorized companies who will be responsible for its\n            collection, removal and/or eventual regeneration; reusable\n            wastes resulting from equipment removal, i.e., ferrous\n            metallic, non-ferrous metallic, ceramic materials, shall be\n            sorted, and temporarily stored on the power station\n            platform, to be then transported by authorized companies\n            responsible for its collection, recycling, and/or re-uses;\n            equipment containing compounds, i.e., PCBs - polychlorinated\n            biphenyls - will be removed in compliance with legal and\n            regulatory frameworks, to be stored at approved, selected\n            sites; to minimize noise disturbances, a maximum number of\n            equipment operating simultaneously will be established, so\n            as not to exceed acceptable noise levels, and, new equipment\n            to be procured, should be consistent in diminished noise\n            generation. In addition, scheduled working hours should\n            observe general norms of labor protection related to noise\n            levels; the absence of anticorrosive protection materials in\n            water systems, calls for the modernization of sealing\n            systems, featuring biodegradable absorbing instruments and\n            materials, such as absorbent pads, rolls, or anticorrosive\n            solvents, primers, and paints, in accordance with\n            international standards; soil erosion and contamination\n            shall be minimized through careful handling of lubricants\n            and oils, avoiding discharges, or pumping, taking special\n            consideration to the replacement, and decontamination of\n            drainage sands to prevent oil leakages; fire prevention and\n            control measures will be in place, and, extinguishers\n            (including portable ones) will be required, as will adequate\n            staff training, and evacuation procedures, as needed;\n            monitoring criteria, and regular inspections will be in\n            place to ensure compliance with environmental regulations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Framework for environmental assessment\n            procedures for energy transmission line projects inTurkey"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Europe and Central Asia Region -\n            South East Europe Regional  Energy Market Program Project :\n            environmental assessment (Vol. 2) : Framework for\n            environmental assessment procedures for energy transmission\n            line projects inTurkey"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6105729/europe-central-asia-region-south-east-europe-regional-energy-market-program-project-environmental-assessment-vol-2-framework-environmental-assessment-procedures-energy-transmission-line-projects-inturkey","projn":"RO-Energy Community Of South East Europe\n            Project (Ecsee Apl #1) -- P086694","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Europe and Central Asia","authors":{"authr":"ISCE S.A.

The\n            framework elaborates the Bank's role in supporting\n            policy reform, institutional development, and lending for\n            power generation, transmission, distribution. Within this\n            framework, the Regional Energy Community of South East\n            Europe Program will: a) Create a stable regulatory and\n            market framework to attract investments to the region in\n            gas, and power network systems; b) ensure the integration of\n            regional markets in South East Europe; c) enhance the energy\n            security of supply to South East Europe and the European\n            Union, providing incentives to connect the Balkans to\n            Caspian, and North African gas reserves; and, d) improve the\n            environmental situation in relation to energy in the region.\n            Under the Program, this project will finance the\n            rehabilitation of the Lotru station, having\n            Romania/Hidroelectrica been awarded the main rehabilitation\n            contract for the Lotru Hydro Project in the country.\n            Romania's transmission system operator (TSO)\n            Transelectrica, uses the ancillary services made available\n            by Hidroelectrica from its Lotru station, operating with a\n            regional approach in power system operations. Romania's\n            market operator - OPCOM - operates a functioning electricity\n            market, with an increasingly regional approach.\n            Hidroelectrica will monitor and evaluate project\n            implementation on a regular basis, including achievement of\n            the objectives, and should submit quarterly progress\n            reports. The project however, triggers operational\n            safeguards, both on the environment, and on international\n            waterways aspects. Project design and environmental\n            safeguards will be ensured through project implementation,\n            while concerning issues on international waterways the\n            project is on the Lotru River, which flows into the Olt\n            River, in turn into the Danube on the border between Romania\n            and Bulgaria, before reaching the Black Sea. Nonetheless, an\n            exemption has been granted, because the Lotru Project does\n            not involve works and activities that would exceed the\n            original scheme, change its nature, or alter and expand its\n            scope and extent, to make it appear a new or different scheme."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Energy Community of South East\n            Europe Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Energy Community of\n            South East Europe Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5536127/romania-energy-community-south-east-europe-program-project","projn":"RO-Energy Community Of South East Europe\n            Project (Ecsee Apl #1) -- P086694","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Trade and Regional Integration,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Health Economics & Finance,Energy Trade","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Europe and Central Asia","entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050107100104"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, benchmarking, benchmarks,\n            conditionality, consumers, cost savings, CURRENCY, debt,\n            donor agencies, economic activity, economic development,\n            economic growth, economics, electricity demand, electricity\n            generation, employment, Environmental Management, European\n            Investment Bank, Exchange Rate, exports, Financial Analysis,\n            Financial institutions, financial instruments, Financial\n            Management, financial support, households, international\n            financial institutions, investment projects, legislation,\n            market liberalization, matching, Negotiations, policy\n            decisions, power plants, private sector, Procurement,\n            Project Costs, risk mitigation, safety, social progress,\n            suppliers, sustainable development, technical assistance,\n            telecommunications, Power distribution; Electgricity trade;\n            Power generation; Power supply systems;"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF030447-SPANISH CTF - FY04 (ECA ENERGY\n            & MINING)","repnb":"29993"},"facets":{}}}
