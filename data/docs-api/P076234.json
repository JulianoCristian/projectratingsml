Some lessons learned includes:\n            sustainability is a function of multiple factors. Moreover:\n            sustainability is a continuum, rather than an absolute: the\n            more factors are in play, the higher the likelihood of\n            sustainable operation; and the actual factors at play in any\n            given situation will differ, and need to be identified\n            during project design, while allowing for additional factors\n            to be included during implementation. Success breeds\n            success. Considerable complementary investments became\n            available once the successes were communicated, particularly\n            by the beneficiaries themselves, using mass media. The\n            institutional reforms that come with the introduction of a\n            Community-Driven Development (CDD) operation lead to\n            efficiency and effectiveness in their own right, but in\n            addition, they are an excellent preparation for a fiscal\n            decentralization effort.
