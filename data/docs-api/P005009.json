With the project, system congestion will decrease and\n            existing telecommunications facilities will be used more\n            efficiently. User resources presently wasted on higher cost\n            means of communication will be saved. Further, losses of\n            production and marketing efficiency, caused by the present\n            lack of communication, will be reduced and expansion of\n            industries and activities that rely on good communications\n            will be facilitated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second Telecommunications Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Second Telecommunications Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/02/727044/egypt-second-telecommunications-project","projn":"EG-Telecommunications Ii-268983 -- P005009","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Telecommunications Infrastructure,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Rural Communications,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912270911"},"subsc":"(Historic)Telecommunications and informatics","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Automatic\n            Exchanges,calls,circuits,cities,Coaxial Cable,coaxial\n            cables,communication needs,communication sector,competitive\n            bidding,consumer price index,consumer\n            surplus,consumers,contractors,cost savings,debt,discount\n            rate,dividends,economic activity,economic\n            development,economic rate of return,electronic switching\n            equipment,expenditures,frequencies,GDP,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,intermediate\n            inputs,legislation,local networks,microwave\n            equipment,Modulation,networks,population densities,price\n            levels,programs,public telecommunications,quality of\n            service,radio,receivers,resource\n            mobilization,speech,submarine cables,Subscriber Trunk\n            Dialing,subscribers,Switching,switching\n            equipment,telecom,Telecommunication,Telecommunication\n            Staff,Telecommunications,telecommunications\n            equipment,Telecommunications Facilities,Telecommunications\n            Investment,telecommunications sector,telecommunications\n            services,Telecommunications Training,telegraph,telegraph\n            services,telephone,Telephone cables,telephone\n            connections,telephone density,telephone equipment,Telephone\n            Exchanges,telephone lines,Telephone Service,telephone\n            services,telephone switching equipment,telephone\n            systems,telephones,teleprinters,transmission,transmission\n            systems,valuation,wage rates,wages,willingness to pay,wires"},"1":{"cdata!":"Automatic\n            Exchanges,calls,circuits,cities,Coaxial Cable,coaxial\n            cables,communication needs,communication sector,competitive\n            bidding,consumer price index,consumer\n            surplus,consumers,contractors,cost savings,debt,discount\n            rate,dividends,economic activity,economic\n            development,economic rate of return,electronic switching\n            equipment,expenditures,frequencies,GDP,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,intermediate\n            inputs,legislation,local networks,microwave\n            equipment,Modulation,networks,population densities,price\n            levels,programs,public telecommunications,quality of\n            service,radio,receivers,resource\n            mobilization,speech,submarine cables,Subscriber Trunk\n            Dialing,subscribers,Switching,switching\n            equipment,telecom,Telecommunication,Telecommunication\n            Staff,Telecommunications,telecommunications\n            equipment,Telecommunications Facilities,Telecommunications\n            Investment,telecommunications sector,telecommunications\n            services,Telecommunications Training,telegraph,telegraph\n            services,telephone,Telephone cables,telephone\n            connections,telephone density,telephone equipment,Telephone\n            Exchanges,telephone lines,Telephone Service,telephone\n            services,telephone switching equipment,telephone\n            systems,telephones,teleprinters,transmission,transmission\n            systems,valuation,wage rates,wages,willingness to pay,wires"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"1756"},"facets":{}}}
