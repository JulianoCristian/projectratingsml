Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            the capacity to mobilize financial resources through one\n            funding mechanism ensured good donor coordination and\n            reduced transaction costs; 2) the health strategy in\n            Timor-Leste (TL) gives evidence of a balanced choice between\n            visible results in terms of reconstruction and service\n            delivery and the development of a customized policy\n            framework and medium-term planning; 3) providing continuous\n            guidance in the context of a limited institutional capacity\n            is essential. The Bank should make all efforts to post the\n            TL or a sector staff in the field to provide day-to-day\n            guidance and help resolve bottlenecks. Bank supervision must\n            be continuous and intensive. Adequate supervision resources\n            must be allocated; 4) there should have been a Mid-term\n            evaluation by the World Bank, as Trustee, of the interim\n            achievements with a view to addressing emerging problems;\n            and 5) for planned civil works/medical equipment\n            procurement, it is important to begin the process early,\n            especially in
