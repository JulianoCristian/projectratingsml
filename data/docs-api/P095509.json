PRSCs can make little\n            progress without a foundation of trust between the Bank and\n            the government, and among development partners at the\n            institutional and individual levels. The mechanisms for\n            dialogue also need to evolve so that the program can\n            continue to support and influence policy decisions at the\n            highest strategic level. To avoid misunderstanding, the Bank\n            and government can plan in advance to recalibrate the\n            program at a set point during implementation. The lack of\n            well-defined and realistic objectives and a fully developed\n            results framework makes adjustment to changing circumstances\n            difficult. Regular reporting on key outcome indicators is\n            essential so that data can drive adjustments to the PRSC\n            program. Transitioning to the use of PRSCs as the primary\n            instrument for resource transfer is only likely to be\n            successful in rare circumstances, when strong central\n            ministries can fully pursue a sector-inclusive dialogue\n            representing the perspectives of key players throughout\n            government. Elevating to the national dialogue\n            sector-specific structural reforms that stalled at the\n            sector level does not guarantee implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -

- Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Fourth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSC) Project for Tanzania were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: first, there is\n            no avoiding conditionality. Good practice principles of\n            policy-based lending are now routinely stated in almost\n            every operation and have become second nature in designing\n            policy-based operations. Donors should reinforce government\n            ownership by supporting rather than duplicating government\n            processes (aid harmonization among donors, alignment of aid\n            with the budget cycle, use of government procurement\n            processes, etc.). There should be an accountability\n            framework that guides both government and donors. Prior\n            Actions (as conditions of disbursement) should be few but\n            critical to the achievement of agreed results. Progress\n            reviews should be transparent and conducive to\n            performance-based, predictable budget support. Second,\n            unlike investment lending operations, PRSCs are able, in\n            principle, to deal with complex cross-cutting issues when\n            the Government has the requisite technical and coordination\n            capacities and the operations are supplemented by sector\n            Investment Loans (ILs), Technical Assistance (TA) and\n            competent analytical work. If the coordination and technical\n            capacities are limited, interventions in complex\n            cross-cutting areas have to be prioritized and sequenced.\n            Over time, as capacities get stronger, the number of complex\n            interventions can be increased. This is an area in which\n            wishful thinking often replaces hard-nosed realism, and\n            results in less than acceptable outcomes. Third, committed\n            political leadership makes a difference. Yet, even the best\n            leadership can only accomplish so much in a given time\n            period. It must overcome ever-present vested interests, old\n            mind-sets and ingrained behaviors, even assuming that\n            technical and organizational capacities are adequate. This\n            is a tricky area. There are often AAA products (as was the\n            case with a string of policy notes in Tanzania) that\n            identify aspects of these issues and there is anecdotal\n            evidence. But the job of transforming that knowledge into\n            successful interventions ultimately falls to the government.\n            The donors can at best figure out what actions are likely to\n            succeed and back them, or decide that the government is\n            unlikely to follow through and back off. It is extremely\n            difficult to get that balance right. Tanzania has been no\n            exception. Finally, measuring outcomes is important in order\n            to increase focus and accountability. Realistic, focused\n            monitoring frameworks that track progress over time towards\n            ultimate objectives, concentrate the mind of government as\n            well as the donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and\n            Eigth Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Fourth Poverty\n

Support\n            Credit (PRSC-4) is the first in a series of five annual\n            operations supporting the implementation of Tanzania's\n            National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty\n            (MKUKUTA). The strategy covers six focus areas, and its\n            pillars include: growth and the reduction of income poverty,\n            improvements of the quality of life and social well being,\n            and, governance and accountability. This project will\n            support the government pursue its policy objectives laid out\n            in the MKUKUTA, through financing for the execution of the\n            government's FY07 budget. It would also provide the\n            incentives to implement key economic, social and\n            institutional reforms to strengthen the overall performance\n            of the economy and contribute to poverty alleviation. Over\n            the period 2005-2010, it is expected that the reform program\n            under the series of five annual PRSCs will help sustain\n            growth of around 6-8 percent annually, projected to result\n            in a significant reduction in poverty. It would also help\n            the government in making progress toward reaching the\n            Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely, increase school\n            enrollment and literacy rates, reduce child and maternal\n            mortality, increase access to safe water, and strengthen the\n            sustainability of development efforts. There are however\n            several risks, among which the Country Financial\n            Accountability Assessment (CFAA) and the Country Procurement\n            Assessment Report (CPAR) identified significant fiduciary\n            risk, but recent assessments such as the joint HPC\n            Assessment and Action Plan show significant improvements in\n            this area in recent years, and put Tanzania among the best\n            performers in Africa. Additionally, capacity for program\n            implementation and service delivery at both the central and\n            district level is weak, but programs are in place for key\n            areas to strengthen capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Fourth Poverty\n            Reduction
