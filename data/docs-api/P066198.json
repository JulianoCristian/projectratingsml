In addition,\n            cash management services to the MOF, and commercial banks\n            will be introduced, settlement funds from bank reserves on\n            deposit with the BOM will be

telecommunications equipment,\n            and support during the implementation stages. 2) The\n            component will identify the Government's risk\n            priorities, and constraints on
