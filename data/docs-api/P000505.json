The main objectives of the project were to: (a)\n            reorganize the transport sector's public institutions\n            and implement this reorganization with the help of a newly\n            created Inter-ministerial Project Monitoring and\n            Coordination Unit (IPMCU); (b) promote liberalization\n            measures in the transport sector; (c) enhance the\n            development of the private sector in road works and\n            construction materials production; (d) rehabilitate 1,800 km\n            of the priority road network with the assistance of several\n            co-financiers; and (e) reduce the cost of transportation and\n            improve financial resource mobilization for funding road\n            maintenance. The results of the project differed markedly\n            across components: the sector policy component was a good\n            achievement, but the physical accomplishments fell short of\n            project targets. Aside from the underestimation of the costs\n            during preparation of the project, and the absence of\n            performance monitoring indicators in the Memorandum to the\n            President's Report which could have contributed to\n            improve the Borrower's performance, the Bank's\n            performance can be considered satisfactory. The main lesson\n            to be drawn from the project is that road maintenance is\n            very costly and that owing to the country's limited\n            financial capabilities judicious selection of priorities\n            during the Public Expenditure Review must be established\n            taking into consideration the need to carry out periodic\n            maintenance to avoid costly rehabilitation. It must\n            therefore be admitted that for some more years to come, an\n            important part of the external assistance received will have\n            to be allocated to periodic road maintenance and road rehabilitation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad -
