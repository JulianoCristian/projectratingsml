These projects represent a clear\n            evolution in the scope of World Bank lending: the first\n            project was nationwide and concentrated on procurement and\n            installation of equipment in selected water systems in each\n            of the 36 Nigerian states and the National Federal\n            Territory; the second project was restricted to two states\n            (Kaduna and Katsina); and the third project directly\n            assisted 16 small towns. This assessment rated the outcome\n            of the National Water Rehabilitation Project as highly\n            unsatisfactory, sustainability highly unlikely, negligible\n            institutional development Impact, and unsatisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.  For the First\n            Multi-State Water Supply Project, the assessment concurred\n            with the completion report, except that the PPAR rated the\n            outcome as moderately satisfactory. The PPAR rated the\n            outcome of the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project as satisfactory with likely sustainability,\n            substantial institutional development impact and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            There are three principal lessons: First, the targets under\n            the MDGs for water supply and sanitation, focusing only on\n            service coverage and access, need to be expanded to include\n            the reliability and quality of water supplies.  Second,\n            effective coordination between central, state and local\n            governments requires demand-driven approaches where the\n            consumers have the initiative. Third, maintenance merits\n            priority over new works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - National Water Rehabilitation,\n            First Multi-State Water Supply, and Small Towns Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - National Water\n            Rehabilitation, First Multi-State Water Supply, and Small\n            Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6933883/nigeria-national-water-rehabilitation-first-multi-state-water-supply-small-towns-water-supply-sanitation-projects","projn":"NG-Small Towns Water -- P064008,NG-Water Rehab -- P002084,NG-State Water I -- P002109","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Infrastructure Regulation,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060719121550"},"subsc":"Water supply,Other industry,Central government administration,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to safe water, access to water\n            supply, adequate sanitation, administrative support,\n            bacteriological quality, Basin Development, broad range,\n            central government, child mortality, community\n            participation, competitive bidding, continuity of service,\n            distribution systems, Electric Power, groundwater,\n            groundwater sources, households, incentive structure, large\n            water resource, least cost, liters per capita per day, local\n            communities, maintenance of water, maintenance standards,\n            management of water, mortality rate, natural resources,\n            operational performance, operational performance indicators,\n            Operational Policies, pathogens, performance indicators,\n            piped water, pollution, population growth, population growth\n            rate, potable water, power supply, private operators,\n            programs, project management, provision of water, provision\n            of water supply, quality of service, quality of water,\n            quantity of water, River Basin, sanitary excreta disposal,\n            sanitation sector, sanitation services, service delivery,\n            service demand, service quality, Small Town, Small Town\n            project, Small Town Water, Small Town Water Supply, SMALL\n            TOWNS, SMALL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY, STATE WATER, sustainable\n            use, training needs, transaction costs, transparency, urban\n            areas, Urban Water, Utility staff, Water Board, Water\n            Boards, water distribution, water projects, water quality,\n            water quality data, water quality studies, water resource,\n            Water Resources, water samples, Water Sector, Water Sector\n            Reform, water service, water services, water supplies, WATER\n            SUPPLY, water supply projects, water supply service, water\n            supply services, water supply systems, water system, water\n            systems, water treatment"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"2":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF027200-NATIONAL WATER REHABILITATION FUND,TF040474-NIGERIA:  STATE WATER I -\n            PROJECT ANALYSIS IN PREPARATION OF THE ICR,TF038558-NIGERIA: SMALL TOWNS W.

Lessons are outlined as\n            follows. While the project was limited in its scope to\n            rehabilitation, and institutional building within the State\n            Water Agency (SWA), thus limited in its impact, the Bank\n            rightly used the project to initiate, and promote policy\n            reforms. To this end, the sector was well positioned on the\n            national agenda - once political stabilization was achieved\n            - and, it is important to note that this could not have been\n            achieved, had it not been for the interest emerged,\n            championed within the country, for initiating, and\n            implementing reforms. However, it also holds true that in a\n            country where logistics are often difficult, projects should\n            be kept focused only on few states: management\n            infrastructure was weak to supervise the large number of\n            subprojects, which led to delays; rather a focus on full\n            rehabilitation would have been preferred, which could have\n            raised awareness, and capacity building within all SWAs.\n            This obviously led to a large number of small contracts,\n            which could not attract international contractors, but\n            instead overstreched national capacity. In designing water\n            supply works, perspectives should lie on getting water to\n            the ultimate beneficiary: benefits however were constrained\n            by inadequate distribution networks, a factor which could\n            have been solved by the SWAs financing additional works\n            themselves, provided political stability existed. Other\n            lessons reinforce project preparation be well advanced prior\n            to loan effectiveness; funds should be secured; Project\n            Preparation Facility mechanisms be used as needed; and,\n            reliable performance indicators facilitate the monitoring process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
