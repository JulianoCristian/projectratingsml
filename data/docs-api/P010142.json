Both\n            projects were rated unsatisfactory. The Bank played an\n            important supporting role in the fulfillment of the project.\n            The objectives and approach proposed by the Bank were\n            generally sound. Bank supervision, and technical support\n            increased the transparency of the privatization process, and\n            certain project financed investments may have made the\n            estates more attractive to private investors. A\n            comprehensive strategy, organized around a logical\n            framework, is required in order to: i) generate sustainable\n            growth, and ii) improve the welfare of those who earn a\n            living from the tree crops sector. These ultimate objectives\n            can only be achieved by galvanizing the sector via improved\n            technology and increased factor productivity, and by\n            competing more effectively in international markets. Success\n            with regard to these intermediate objectives in turn\n            requires a significant injection of capital, investment in\n            human resources (\"putting people first\"), along\n            with the reliance on the industry's global expertise,\n            and elimination of wasteful practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
