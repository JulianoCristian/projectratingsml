Some lessons learned\n            included: strong Government ownership is critical,\n            particularly with health reform projects. Health reform not\n            only concerns technical, health-related changes but relies\n            heavily on the political process. In First Adaptable Program\n            Loan (APL1), Government ownership and commitment were\n            crucial in the passage of key laws such as family medicine\n            and Universal Health Insurance (UHI). APL1 was linked\n            entirely to the Government's HTP, which helped to build\n            ownership. Long-term engagement. Health sector reforms often\n            take 5-10 years, and the Bank should adopt a longer-term\n            approach in its support. Instruments such as APLs offer the\n            ability to provide long-term support and apply lessons\n            learned from previous phases. Policy learning rather than\n            policy borrowing. APL1 focused on capacity building and\n            technical assistance, rather than a traditional investment\n            project, which had previously been implemented poorly in\n            Turkey. Technical knowledge and expertise from international\n            experts and the Bank helped to build capacity in Turkey for\n            more sustainable achievements in the health sector. Results\n            framework indicators should be more specific and applied\n            more consistently. Lack of clarity in indicators means that\n            indicators are subject to different interpretations. In\n            APL1, some indicators referring to policy achievements or\n            capacity building measures could have been more specific.\n            Indicators should not be seen as purely for accountability\n            or evaluation; instead, they should be used as a management\n            tool for continuous performance monitoring and feedback.\n            Similarly, the agreed set of indicators should be\n            consistently applied in order to reinforce the objectives of\n            the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Health Transition

efficiency, user and provider\n            satisfaction, and long-term fiscal sustainability of the\n            healthcare system in Turkey. The project has the following\n            six components: Component A) supports Ministry of Health\n            (MOH's) institutional transition from a provider of\n            services to a policy maker and regulator of service\n            provision, while retaining key public health functions. This\n            component has four sub-components: (i) restructuring of the\n            MOH; (ii) establishment of a National Pharmaceutical and\n            Medical Devices Agency (NPMDA); (iii) quality assurance and\n            accreditation of health facilities; and (iv) establishing\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Capacity for the Program\n            for Transformation in Health (PTH). Component B) supports\n            the establishment of a single health insurance fund by means\n            of consolidating the four existing health insurance schemes,\n            and expanding its reach to an additional estimated 22\n            million citizens who are not fully covered. Component C) has\n            four sub-components: (i) introduction of family medicine as\n            an organizational model for the provision of outpatient or\n            primary health care services; (ii) harmonization of MOH and\n            SSK hospitals towards greater autonomy; (iii) developing an\n            effective patient referral system to reinforce system\n            hierarchy; and (iv) strengthening population health\n            programs, including disease surveillance, maternal and child\n            health, prevention and control of communicable and\n            non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The reorganization will be\n            implemented in a phased manner, with pilots in large cities\n            during Phase I, to be rolled out nationwide during the\n            second phase. Component D) has two sub-components: (i)\n            health and social security human resources policy and\n            planning; and (ii) strengthening the School of Public Health\n            (SPH), to become a center of excellence in advocacy,\n            training and research for the MOH. Component E) supports the\n            development of national standards in line with the\n            realignment of institutional roles and responsibilities in\n            both MOH and Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MOLSS).\n            Component F) involves activities related to project\n            management. It will support project coordination between the\n            two ministries as well as project implementation in each\n            ministry, and an oversight mechanism for overall project\n            guidance and policy support for both the PTH and the project itself."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Health Transition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Health Transition
