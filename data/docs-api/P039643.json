Despite its failure to achieve\n            satisfactory development outcomes, this project offers\n            valuable lessons, including confirmation of experience in\n            other countries. Specific lessons include: 1) If you amplify\n            HIV/AIDS messages in the face of uncertainty, you risk\n            undermining those activities that require that you\n            continuously nurture political and institutional support. 2)\n            If you fail to assess institutional options and\n            responsibilities prior to the launch of the project and fail\n            to develop local ownership, institutional arrangements\n            within the agency leading the AIDS response will become\n            unworkable. 3) To develop AIDS-related institutions and\n            services requires that engagement with clients for the\n            long-term, rather than through a three-year pilot operation.\n            4) More donor funds may be available in some environments,\n            particularly in the pre-epidemic stages of HIV, than\n            recipient countries are able to absorb. This is so in\n            particular for direct HIV/AIDS services that are provided\n            through nongovernmental organizations. 5) The physical\n            proximity of the task manager in the Country Office does not\n            necessarily strengthen supervisory support for project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - HIV/AIDS and STDs Prevention and\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - HIV/AIDS and STDs\n            Prevention and Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6065534/indonesia-hivaids-stds-prevention-management-project","projn":"ID-Std/Aids -- P039643","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050714154853"},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, AIDS\n            pandemic, baseline surveys, behavior change, Behavioral\n            interventions, Behavioral Surveillance, blood donors, blood\n            supply, capacity building, CAS, child health, Commercial\n            sex, Commercial sex worker, commercial sex workers,\n            Communicable Disease Control, condom use, Country Assistance\n            Strategies, Disease Prevention, drug use, Environmental\n            Health, epidemiological data, Epidemiology, evaluation\n            activities, evaluation methods, expenditures, Family\n            Planning, flexibility, Health, health care, Health\n            Education, health sector, health services, health workers,\n            high risk groups, High-risk, high-risk groups, HIV, HIV\n            infections, HIV positive, HIV prevention, HIV transmission,\n            Human immunodeficiency virus, ICR, Immunization,\n            Immunodeficiency, Implementation Completion Report, income,\n            intervention, iodine deficiency, laboratory services,\n            Malaria, media, National AIDS Commission, National AIDS\n            Prevention, NGO, non-governmental organizations,\n            nongovernmental organizations, nutrition, Parenthood\n            Association, partnership, peer review, Performance\n            Indicators, PMU, Poverty Reduction, pretesting, prevention\n            interventions, private sector, programs, Project management,\n            Project Management Unit, Project Objectives, public health,\n            public health services, public sector, risk groups, safe\n            sex, screening, service delivery, sex with men, sex workers,\n            sexually transmitted diseases, Social Marketing, STDs,\n            syndromic management, transmission, transparency,\n            Tuberculosis, UNAIDS, Water supply, World Health Organization"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029184-PHRD-HIV/AIDS & STD MGMT.\n            & PREVENTION,TF032093-INDONESIA - HEALTH","repnb":"32572"},"729080":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/06/729080/indonesia-hivaids-stds-prevention-management-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/06/729080/indonesia-hivaids-stds-prevention-management-project","new_url":"2000/06/729080/indonesia-hivaids-stds-prevention-management-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/09/15/000094946_00090605390681/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/09/15/000094946_00090605390681/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"3981","datestored":"2001-04-10T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2000-06-16T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - HIV/AIDS and STDs Prevention\n            and Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the HIV/AIDS and STDs\n            Prevention and Management Project was rated as\n            unsatisfactory. The project was successful in developing a\n            laboratory system to support HIV/AIDS and STD testing and\n            surveillance, unfortunately support from the other\n            components was negligible. As a result, the project was not\n            able to produce a comprehensive model of proved\n            effectiveness for the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS\n            and STDs. Bank supervision was ineffective in pushing\n            attainment of project goals. Key lessons drawn this project\n            include: 1) the project was ambitious in its design and\n            objectives. Three years was too short a period for achieving\n            behavioral change targets, particularly since most\n            guidelines, manuals, modules, and information, education,\n            and communication materials materials were still to be\n            developed during the first years of the project. 2) The\n            decision to establish a Project Management Unit (PMU) led by\n            a Project Manager who was responsible not just for project\n            administration but also for technical matters proved to be\n            counter productive. 3) The project was a pilot that had to\n            deal with numerous activities in a short time frame,\n            involving multiple groups of people, numerous agencies and\n            individuals in different locations. 4) The project correctly\n            put an nongovernmental organizations capacity building\n            component in the project, which was directed particularly at\n            smaller nongovernmental organizations with strong ties to\n            particular groups of interest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

These policy\n            pronouncements are aimed at achieving lower STD and HIV\n            incidence and fewer deaths from AIDS in Indonesia, and the\n            aim of this project is to use intensive pilot efforts to\n            develop institutional mechanisms and interventions capable\n            of reducing transmission of STDs) and HIV in Indonesia. A\n            core program for STD and HIV prevention in two pilot areas\n            will be designed and implemented in partnership with local\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); extensive monitoring\n            and evaluation will identify which trial interventions were\n            promising and worth continuing. The project consists of\n            provincial level components and complementary central level\n            activities. Provincial (including district and\n            municipality-managed) interventions will introduce\n            simultaneously and in the same localities various behavior\n            changes and service delivery measures thought likely to\n            achieve significant outcomes. Behavioral trials and other\n            interventions to reduce or prevent risk will typically be\n            carried out by NGOs and will include peer and workplace\n            education, counseling and other measures targeted at\n            different groups."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - HIV/AIDS and STDs Prevention and\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - HIV/AIDS and STDs\n            Prevention and Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/01/732577/indonesia-hivaids-stds-prevention-management-project","projn":"ID-Std/Aids -- P039643","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,HIV AIDS,Banks & Banking Reform,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Health Economics & Finance","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008083819"},"subsc":"Sub-National Government,Central Government,Health","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Agriculture,Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome,Agriculture,AIDS,AIDS interventions,AIDS\n            Prevention,behavior change,Behavioral interventions,blood\n            bank,Blood screening,Capital markets,case\n            management,commercial sex,commercial sex\n            workers,Communicable Diseases,Community Health,community\n            participation,condoms,counselors,Crops,decision\n            making,delivery mechanisms,distribution of\n            condoms,Environmental\n            Health,expenditures,extension,families,Financial\n            Sector,Financial services,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,health education,health insurance,health\n            policy,health providers,health status,health\n            workers,HIV,HIV,HIV prevention,HIV transmission,Human\n            Immunodeficiency Virus,Immune\n            Deficiency,Immunodeficiency,income,institutional\n            development,labor force,laboratories,laboratory\n            equipment,liquidation,Low Income,Managers,mass\n            media,metropolitan\n            areas,morbidity,needles,NGOs,nurses,Nutrition,partnership,patients,peer\n            educators,present value,private sector,public\n            policy,Safety,savings,screening,service delivery,sex\n            industry,sex workers,Sexually transmitted diseases,social\n            welfare,STDs,technical\n            assistance,Textiles,transmission,Urban\n            Development,waste,waste disposal,Water Supply,World Health Organization"},"1":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome,Agriculture,AIDS,AIDS interventions,AIDS\n            Prevention,behavior change,Behavioral interventions,blood\n            bank,Blood screening,Capital markets,case\n            management,commercial sex,commercial sex\n            workers,Communicable Diseases,Community Health,community\n            participation,condoms,counselors,Crops,decision\n            making,delivery mechanisms,distribution of\n            condoms,Environmental\n            Health,expenditures,extension,families,Financial\n            Sector,Financial services,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,health education,health insurance,health\n            policy,health providers,health status,health\n            workers,HIV,HIV,HIV prevention,HIV transmission,Human\n            Immunodeficiency Virus,Immune\n            Deficiency,Immunodeficiency,income,institutional\n            development,labor force,laboratories,laboratory\n            equipment,liquidation,Low Income,Managers,mass\n            media,metropolitan\n            areas,morbidity,needles,NGOs,nurses,Nutrition,partnership,patients,peer\n            educators,present value,private sector,public\n            policy,Safety,savings,screening,service delivery,sex\n            industry,sex workers,Sexually transmitted diseases,social\n            welfare,STDs,technical\n            assistance,Textiles,transmission,Urban\n            Development,waste,waste disposal,Water Supply,World Health Organization"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF032093-INDONESIA - HEALTH,TF029184-PHRD-HIV/AIDS & STD MGMT.\n            & PREVENTION","repnb":"P6754"},"facets":{}}}
