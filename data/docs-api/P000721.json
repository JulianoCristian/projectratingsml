The overall impact of the project on the\n            education sector has been negligible. Given the extended\n            time period and a high cost of the project, the results are\n            judged to be less than satisfactory. Key lessons learned are\n            summarized as: The central offices of the Ministry needs to\n            build capacity to supervise construction effectively.\n            Additional suitably qualified personnel and transport are\n            required. Large packages also exclude small local\n            contractors, and when a contractor with a large package\n            performs poorly, many schools are affected. Thus, smaller\n            packages of four to five schools awarded on a geographical\n            basis would be more effective and give local contractors an\n            opportunity to compete. If effective procedures are\n            introduced to enable payments to be made at regional and\n            zonal levels, less time will be needed and therefore cost\n            savings will be realized. Much time was lost over\n            disagreements and misunderstandings about procedures;\n            training courses may be necessary for regional staff to\n            facilitate the award of contracts at the regional level.\n            Insufficient coordination of inputs resulted in poor use of\n            resources. More attention needs to be paid to the\n            programming and timing of activities related to civil works.\n            The cost-effectiveness of providing fencing, electrical\n            installations, and plumbing has to be evaluated before civil\n            works contracts are awarded."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Seventh Education
