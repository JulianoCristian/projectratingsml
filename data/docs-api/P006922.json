The proposed loan would support\n            the Government's export development program through: i)\n            establishment of a revolving Export Financing Fund (FOPEX)\n            in the Central Bank to help ensure adequate access of\n            exporters to foreign exchange for imported inputs; ii)\n            provision through FOPEX of short-term financing for both\n            imported and local inputs; iii) strengthening the\n            Government's export promotion policy framework; and iv)\n            provision of technical assistance to the Government and its\n            Export Promotion and Investment Center (CENPRO) to\n            strengthen export and investment promotion efforts and\n            services to exporters. By providing exporters with timely\n            and adequate access to foreign exchange, the proposed loan\n            is expected to facilitate improved capacity utilization in\n            export
