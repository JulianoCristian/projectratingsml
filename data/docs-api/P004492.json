The overall outcome of the project was\n            satisfactory; the performance of the Bank and the borrower\n            was rated satisfactory. The project objectives are as\n            follows: To support the Government's industrial\n            development program and to address the major policy and\n            management issues affecting industrial training, the main\n            thrust of the Project was to broaden and strengthen the\n            infrastructure of national industrial training. Lessons\n            learned: Bank staff contributed towards project success\n            through substantial assistance in project design and\n            implementation. A flexible approach taken by the Bank during\n            implementation, particularly with the prevailing national\n            poor economic performance and political instability, was a\n            major contribution to its success. These points constitute\n            positive lessons learned for the future. Other findings and\n            lessons learned include the need to ensure site acquisition\n            as early as possible in the project cycle and evaluate\n            procurement procedures. Finally, that the Bank should pay\n            attention to the staffing of supervision missions and ensure\n            that appropriate skills are included."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Vocational Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines -
