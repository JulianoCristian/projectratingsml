Ratings for the Higher Education Learning and\n            Innovation Project for Yemen were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was highly unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Ratings for the Higher\n            Education Project for Jordan were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the introduction of a widely adopted change model\n            needs to be preceded by sufficient sector analytic work to\n            create an appreciation of the complexities (implications) of\n            the changes and of the likely sources of resistance. Such\n            analysis could help determine the parts of the model that\n            are appropriate to the context, and the pace of adoption.\n            Efforts to improve the quality of higher education need to\n            improve student learning outcomes. Standard assessment of\n            student achievement in higher education is challenging, both\n            in a technical and a political sense. Moves in that\n            direction have already begun in Egypt and Jordan.\n            Restructuring higher education courses and programs and\n            ensuring appropriate private sector participation in\n            decision-making are not in themselves sufficient to ensure\n            that reforms will result in more employable graduates.\n            Higher education systems need to systematically monitor the\n            labor market relevance of their offerings and the success of\n            their graduates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Higher Education Enhancement\n

It is unclear, however, to what extent the higher\n            education system in Egypt is prepared for quality and\n            efficiency improvement. The participative and\n            'pedagogical' approach based on institutional self\n            assessment, peer reviews and the development of strategic\n            plan has ensured ownership and strong commitment from\n            academic staff. To be sustained this commitment needs to be\n            supported by appropriate funding. Whenever the nature of the\n            activities planned in the project require the recruitment of\n            large numbers of academic staff, the procedures and\n            conditions for hiring such staff should be agreed upon\n            during the project preparation and disclosed in the project\n            documents. The financial management manual and the project\n            accounting and financial reporting system need to be ready\n            at the early stages of the project.

education system in Egypt, through legislative\n            reform, institutional restructuring, and establishment of\n            independent quality assurance mechanisms, and monitoring\n            systems. The first component will support the\n            Government's efforts to restructure system governance,\n            and management, so that conditions are in place to support\n            improved sector efficiency, and quality. Specifically, the\n            component includes reforming legislation governing higher\n            education; rationalizing funding allocation practices -\n            financing international technical assistance for resource\n            allocation across higher institutions; establishing a\n            national quality assurance council, guided by technical\n            assistance in establishing the performance standards for an\n            accredited system of higher education. Management training,\n            and capacity building will be financed, as will the\n            establishment of an integrated management information\n            system, and of a project fund for higher education\n            institutions to improve teaching/learning abilities. The\n            second component will improve the quality, and relevance of\n            university education, through the establishment of an\n            information technology (IT) integrated computer, and network\n            infrastructure, and finance in-service training to develop\n            competencies in the application of computer technology,\n            particularly in teaching methodologies. Finally, the third\n            component will improve the quality, and relevance of\n            mid-level technical education, by consolidating middle\n            technical institutes into technical colleges, designing\n            relevant curriculum, and training instruction, and,\n            strengthening academic administration and management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Higher
