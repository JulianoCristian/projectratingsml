The\n            project was successful in meeting its objectives, its impact\n            on institutional development was negligible, sustainability\n            is likely, and both the Bank and Borrower performed\n            satisfactorily. Two key lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the chances of technical problems affecting\n            project implementation could have been reduced if\n            WAPDA's technical staff assigned to the project had\n            been able to perform their anticipated functions in a timely\n            manner. The fact that these officials had to devote\n            considerable time to routine administrative matters\n            highlights the need for WAPDA to streamline its\n            administrative procedures so as to more effectively utilize\n            its technical manpower and resources. Second, the project\n            highlights an issue arising from design changes during\n            implementation. While the conversion to fuel oil firing\n            probably saved on the direct cost of generation for this\n            project, it has left the unanticipated problem of disposal\n            of waste sludge, traffic congestion, and significantly\n            higher plant maintenance costs. As these design changes were\n            midstream events, they probably did not receive the level of\n            scrutiny normally associated with project appraisal.\n            Clearly, both the Bank and Borrower should review and agree\n            on major modifications of the design only after all the\n            associated costs (and benefits) have been identified and evaluated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
