This provided the critical\n            basis for the design and implementation of a project which\n            focused on \"cooperation\" rather than\n            \"assistance; 2) the sustained high level commitment by\n            the Borrower and the Bank was critical to the success of the\n            Project. The Borrower, despite several successive Ministers\n            of Environment and changes in local governments, remained\n            strongly committed to the objectives of the Project. Bank\n            management provided adequate resources during all stages of\n            the Project, including supervision, to maintain a core\n            \"project team\" of experienced Bank staff and\n            highly qualified consultants; 3) project preparation was\n            based on a field review process which led to clear\n            identification of institutional and professional priorities;\n            a large number of representatives of these institutions were\n            effectively involved in the process; 4) a major factor\n            contributing to the sustained quality of the Project during\n            all phases of design and implementation was the careful\n            selection of the primary Borrower and Bank staff and their\n            high level of continuity; and 5) both\\ design and\n            implementation were facilitated by the cooperative\n            development of work plans; including schedules, budgets and\n            procurement plans. Joint preparation of these work plans\n            allowed the Borrower and the Bank to have a clear\n            understanding of the common goals and key actions necessary\n            to achieve successful implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
