Debates on the economic policy in\n            transition economies question the merits of a \"big\n            bang\" approach, relative to a more gradual strategy,\n            the argument being that incentive reforms - in the absence\n            of institutional reforms - will create new distortions, with\n            an unlikely sustainability. However, a lesson supported by\n            this project, mainly exemplified by the project's\n            reform program, seem to indicate that under the right\n            conditions, the big bang may prove effective, for it was not\n            until the Government took decisive action on a stabilization\n            program based on a currency board, along with an ambitious\n            structural adjustment program, that the country initiated a\n            market economy approach, with a seemingly accelerated\n            economic growth. Further lessons suggest the value of\n            constructive disengagement in a poor policy environment.\n            Since the Bank was not associated with the old regime, it\n            was thus well positioned to engage, and support the new\n            Government, moving quickly through the Critical Imports\n            Rehabilitation Loan, once it was clear reforms would be\n            taken seriously. Additionally, the value of good sector work\n            laid the foundations for successful lending operations, and\n            extensive dialogue supported the conditions for the project success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -

Reforms will occur in\n            the areas of pricing, trace, agricultural subsidies and\n            finance, land markets, cereals markets, and agriculture\n            enterprise privatization. The reforms will increase domestic\n            marketing competitiveness by expediting development of a\n            private land market, significantly reducing the state's\n            role as a marketing and processing intermediary, improving\n            the incentives environment by eliminating price and trade\n            controls, and reducing subsidized government credit. This\n            will improve income-earning opportunities for rural people,\n            contribute to rural employment generation, and help raise\n            rural living standards. Consumers will benefit from improved\n            agricultural product quality and availability, greater\n            choice, and more efficient marketing demands. The most\n            important risks are first, political resistance by powerful\n            interest groups, and second, that the program will be\n            undermined by a non-supportive
