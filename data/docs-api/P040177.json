The objective of the Project was\n            to assist the Borrower to develop the institutional capacity\n            it requires to be able to address the systemic\n            vulnerabilities of its financial system, through: (a) the\n            design and implementation of a banking sector consolidation\n            program; (b) the reform of the Borrower's payment\n            system; and (c) the improvement of selected aspects of the\n            Borrower's financial system infrastructure. The\n            principal lessons learned for Project design and\n            implementation are as follows: (i) in an environment of\n            limited implementation capacity, Project design should be as\n            simple as possible; (ii) the largest project component in\n            terms of financing, the modernization of the payment system,\n            suffered from an incomplete and superficial diagnostic at\n            inception and an overly complex design.; (iii) in low-income\n            countries with limited implementation capacity, it is\n            critical to plan for and expect longer-term International\n            Development Association (IDA) engagements since these\n            Projects often encounter adverse circumstances and delays;\n            and (iv) IDA should agree up-front with government on the\n            size and composition of the Project Coordination Unit  (PCU)\n            as well as the minimum experience and qualifications for\n            each position."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Financial Sector\n

The objectives of this component are: A.\n            (i) establish a conducive framework for an improved\n            soundness of the Honduran financial system, (ii) facilitate\n            the market exit of the weakest / non-viable banks, and (iii)\n            contribute to the institutional strengthening of the CNBS.\n            B. Under this component, the project will carry-out an\n            upgrade of the current systems, including the launching of a\n            special purpose large value payments system that will allow\n            for the separation of large and low value payments and the\n            establishment of a securities depository function. C. The\n            suggested component will focus on three aspects of the\n            financial system infrastructure: (i) the institutional\n            framework for Anti Money Laundering activities &\n            Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), (ii) the\n            oversight of the corporate sector and effectiveness of\n            insolvency proceedings, and (iii) the policy instruments\n            used to facilitate access to finance by small agricultural\n            producers. D. Under this component, the project will finance\n            the salaries of project staff, operational expenses\n            (including audits, local transportation and travel, etc.),\n            training and limited equipment.  E. An unallocated reserve\n            of about 4.5% of the total project costs (US$ 0.49 million\n            equivalent) has been set to allow for a limited level of\n            flexibility in project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Financial Sector\n
