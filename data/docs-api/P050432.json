Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: a) disbursement of\n            the whole amount of the loan in one tranche instead of two\n            or more was recognized as risky since there would be no\n            leverage for follow up. However, the risk was mitigated by\n            sufficiently front-loading the conditions of Board\n            presentation and by the demonstrated commitment of the\n            Government in meeting the conditions of Board presentation;\n            and b) another risk related to weak implementation capacity\n            of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MOLSP) , the\n            main agency of the Government responsible for follow up. In\n            addition, the loan was for general fiscal and balance of\n            payments support, and was not disbursed to the MOLSP's\n            budget. However, this risk was mitigated by the fact that\n            the ongoing Employment and Social Protection Project (ESPP)\n            was restructured to support the MOLSP in implementing the\n            SPAL follow-up actions.
