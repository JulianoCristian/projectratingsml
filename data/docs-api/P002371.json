Lessons learned include: 1) Agence\n            d'Execution de Travaux d'Intert Public contre le\n            sous emploi (Public Works Executing Agency) (AGETIP) has\n            shown unequivocally that it is possible to have a private\n            autonomous agency capable of executing public works\n            efficiently and effectively, without the help of external\n            technical assistance. The success of the projects undertaken\n            by AGETIP (which include but are not limited to this credit)\n            have strengthened the position of AGETIP as an executing\n            agency for Government projects and have confirmed the\n            usefulness and efficacy of the concept of delegated contract\n            management. 2) With regard to a separate component of the\n            project, improving public procurement, the difficulties of\n            general procurement laws have become apparent not only\n            through this project but through AGETIP projects in other\n            countries as well. A lesson to be drawn is that AGETIP\n            projects per se are perhaps not the best instrument through\n            which general government procurement processes can be\n            reformed. Through this project, Government has demonstrated\n            its willingness to streamline and make more transparent the\n            procurement process of specific sectors. However, to try and\n            expand this to the rest of the economy in one fell swoop\n            might be too optimistic a goal for one sector investment\n            project. General procurement reform is being undertaken in\n            the context of improved portfolio management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Second Public Works and Employment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal -
