These were some of the lessons\n            learned from this project. The project outcomes confirmed an\n            experience from Romania and Russia, that severance as seed\n            capital failed to result in an appreciable level of\n            development activity (new businesses were not created). This\n            was partially due to the fact that the amount of severance\n            was limited, and partially due to an insufficient assistance\n            to new business entities. Another lesson learned is that the\n            administration of social support programs for workers being\n            displaced is best centered in one agency that has a direct\n            interest to ensure that the program operates. The most\n            successful labor redeployment program was the retraining\n            program. Structural unemployment experienced by displaced\n            workers, who lack skills or whose skills are not in demand,\n            and who need to retool their skills to compete and re-enter\n            the labor market can be helped by different types of\n            retraining, including on-the-job training and institutional\n            training needed in these circumstances. The user-fee system\n            will probably exclude some people from the training.\n            However, many people can afford to pay the fees and are\n            willing to invest resources in increasing the value of their\n            human capital. The temporary community employment program\n            had an impact on employment. However, this impact was\n            achieved at a very high unit cost. Therefore it is\n            questionable whether the temporary community employment\n            program should form part of any future active labor programs\n            in Macedonia. The small business assistance programs have\n            unfulfilled potential. Integrating the assistance they\n            provide with other measures and programs to provide access\n            to credit could therefore be considered. An active public\n            information campaign also contributed to the success of the\n            project. In a politically volatile environment in which the\n            leadership of key implementing agencies is rapidly changing,\n            the continuity of Project Coordination Unit staff can be key\n            for the project success. Project implementation would\n            benefit if the differences in Bank and Borrower's\n            procurement rules and laws are identified at an earlier\n            stage, and if necessary, amendments to national laws are proposed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Social Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Social Support
