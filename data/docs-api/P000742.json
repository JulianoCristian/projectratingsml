SAC-I was designed to support economic\n            policy during the period in which Ethiopia went through a\n            fundamental transformation from centralized planning to a\n            market-based economy. The program consisted of two main\n            components: (i) support for economic stabilization and (ii)\n            support for the private sector. Bank performance in the\n            identification of the program was highly satisfactory and\n            consistent with the Government's policy as well as with\n            the Bank's assistance strategy. One important lesson\n            learned in this project is providing support and technical\n            assistance for a new Borrower to learn the ropes on\n            procurement and disbursement procedures. The overall\n            performance under the SAC-I was found to be satisfactory.\n            Efforts made to restore growth and stabilize the economy and\n            the results thus obtained were encouraging. Moreover, the\n            private sector has positively responded to the new\n            investment Code. In particular, the targets for real\n            economic growth, inflation rate, and fiscal balance had been attained."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC

The TGE's\n            economic objective is to reduce poverty through rapid\n            labor-intensive growth. This is to be achieved through a\n            fundamental transformation of the economy from centralized\n            planning to markets, with a dominant role for the private\n            sector. In the period immediately following its assumption\n            of power, the TGE concentrated on rehabilitation and relief\n            to cope with the problems of civil disruption, extreme\n            poverty and physical devastation caused by prolonged\n            internal conflict. Since late-1992, when agreement on a\n            Policy Framework Paper (PFP) was reached, the focus has\n            shifted to reconstruction and structural reform. In the\n            first phase, the program will consist of two main\n            components: support for economic stabilization, and support\n            for the private sector. For this, the following actions are\n            covered by SAC I: adjustments in key economic prices\n            (exchange rate, finance and wages); improvements in domestic\n            resource mobilization, including a reduction in the fiscal\n            imbalance; changes in the boundary between public and\n            private economic activity; promotion of price signals and\n            competition; introduction of a market-based system for\n            allocating foreign exchange; trade reforms; and safety net\n            policies for those affected by structural adjustment. During\n            SAC I implementation period, the TGE will also build\n            institutional capacities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Structural Adjustment Credit
