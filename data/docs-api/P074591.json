Some lessons learned included: the project\n            was intended to provide improved water supply service to the\n            urban poor. It is now clear that the government should have\n            provided subsidies for this kind of project. However, the\n            true nature of the project was not fully documented in the\n            project appraisal document, or PAD, and hence the municipal\n            government did not take any action to provide such\n            operational subsidies. This issue should have been dealt\n            with at appraisal, and the role of the government should\n            have been more clearly defined upfront. Prior to project\n            implementation, it is important to have clear guidelines on\n            cost sharing and responsibilities of households. Where\n            feasible, customers should contribute financially to\n            investments to foster their ownership. It is important that\n            the project owner educate users more proactively to inform\n            them of their responsibilities to maintaining the system.\n            One of the major design flaws of the pilot private\n            connections in Dambadarjaa was the estimation of water\n            consumption. The standards in the urban area are not\n            applicable for the current situation of ger areas. It is\n            important to establish and apply standards that are suitable\n            for ger areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Second Ulaanbaatar Services\n            Improvement

The\n            project has benefited more than 300,000 residents of ger\n            areas of Ulaanbaatar by improving both access to water and\n            quality of water supply. More than 50 percent of water\n            kiosks in ger areas are now connected to the water supply\n            network and serve 300 to 500 customers per day per kiosk.\n            The project also contributed to improving the operating\n            performance of the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority of\n            Ulaanbaatar (USUG). The project has savings of SDR 978,000\n            (about US$1.5 million) from works and goods the borrower has\n            requested an extension of the closing date from June 30,\n            2011 to December 31, 2011 with three months of grace period.\n            The extension is necessary to complete the additional activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Second Ulaanbaatar\n            Services Improvement Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14472921/mongolia-second-ulaanbaatar-services-improvement-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"MN-Second Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement\n            Project -- P074591","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Housing & Human Habitats,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions","teratopic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Mongolia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20110628003700"},"subsc":"Water supply","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to water, Household, network,\n            PROJECT, Project Management, projects, pump station, quality\n            of water, quality of water supply, Service, Service\n            Improvement, SERVICES, Sewerage, Sewerage Authority,\n            Sewerage Connections, tariff increase, training, utility,\n            Water, water meters, Water Supply"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia Sustainable Dev (EASCS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF051125-PHRD-MONGOLIA: SECOND\n            ULAANBAATAR SERVICES IMPROVEMENT PROJECT,TF053820-JSDF-MONGOLIA:COMMUNITY-LED\n            INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE URBAN PO,TF053821-JSDF-MONGOLIA:COMMUNITY-LED\n            INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FOR URBAN POOR I","repnb":"62912"},"25722768":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/12/25722768/tunisia-urban-development-poverty-reduction-promoting-growth-urbanization-desarrollo-urbano-aprovechar-la-urbanizaci\u00f3n-para-crecer-y-aliviar-la-pobreza","available_in":"French,Spanish","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"French","entityid":"090224b083ff7d20_1_0","node_id":"25722768"}],"virt_coll":"Results Profile","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/12/25722768/tunisia-urban-development-poverty-reduction-promoting-growth-urbanization-desarrollo-urbano-aprovechar-la-urbanizaci\u00f3n-para-crecer-y-aliviar-la-pobreza","new_url":"2015/12/25722768/tunisia-urban-development-poverty-reduction-promoting-growth-urbanization-desarrollo-urbano-aprovechar-la-urbanizaci\u00f3n-para-crecer-y-aliviar-la-pobreza","disclosure_date":"2015-12-29T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-12-30T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-12-30T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b083ff7d21","chronical_docm_id":"090224b083ff7d21","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/12/29/090224b083ff7d21/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/Desarrollo0urb0y0aliviar0la0pobreza.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/12/29/090224b083ff7d21/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Desarrollo0urb0y0aliviar0la0pobreza.pdf","loan_no":"38900;73140;37640;38010;71540;73060","docdt":"2011-04-18T07:14:05Z","datestored":"2015-12-29T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Urban development - Poverty\n            reduction and promoting growth for urbanization"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This report on poverty reduction and\n            promoting growth for urbanization as an aspect of urban\n            development in Tunisia claims the World Bank aims to respond\n            to both aspects of the challenge posed by urbanization by\n            firstly, helping governments prepare proactively for new\n            urban growth and, secondly, supporting improved service\n            delivery for urban poor.
