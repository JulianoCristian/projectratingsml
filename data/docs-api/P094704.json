Some lessons learned includes: this project\n            was premised on an overly ambitious objective. The inclusion\n            of outcome indicators whose measurement created severe\n            problems of attribution in project impact significantly\n            complicated the assessment of outcomes. The implementing\n            agency had no prior experience in implementing Bank\n            projects. A lack of technical expertise and experience with\n            regard to procurement procedures led to substantial\n            implementation delays. The lesson that can be derived is\n            that transition between Task Team Leader's (TTLs) must\n            be reduced to a minimum and, where handover is unavoidable\n            the Bank should ensure sufficient overlapping time to avoid\n            major discontinuities in the dialogue with counterparts and\n            in the overall consistency of Bank interventions.\n            Appropriate restructuring actions should be considered when\n            major parts of a project are cancelled.
