The lessons drawn from this operation are as\n            follows. The success of the project was mostly based on the\n            Government commitment, particularly in fighting the\n            incidence of tuberculosis (TB), and schistosomiasis, on the\n            extensive focus on the technical aspects of the operation,\n            and on the institutional framework, with careful attention\n            to the administrative, managerial, and financial\n            implementation of the project, enhanced by a high quality\n            supervision. These aspects provided the framework for\n            operational research, building capacity and providing\n            valuable learning for program development. Moreover, the\n            provision of incentives to health providers at the local,\n            and dispensary levels fostered a stronger health system,\n            which would strengthen hospital referrals to TB\n            dispensaries, and to directly observed treatment (DOTS)\n            practices, a valuable practice that should be replicated on\n            a larger scale. However, careful attention needs to be paid\n            in the capacity building of project agencies, for\n            implementation might have been further enhanced, had the\n            project design included initial arrangements to strengthen\n            poorly performing entities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
