Lessons\n            address two main issues: 1) The integrated approach is not\n            always appropriate for large cities, and the absence of a\n            firm sector policy framework can inhibit success. Although\n            water and sanitation components were traditionally included\n            in integrated urban infrastructure development projects,\n            projects designed prior to this operation, included\n            relatively simple subprojects, where the lack of sector\n            policy direction, did not inhibit implementation; but, this\n            project covered water and sanitation that required\n            significant policy direction, and the Bank supports the\n            recommendation by the Operations Evaluation Department, that\n            large water and sanitation components be linked to policy\n            reform. Thus when considering the use of an integrated urban\n            approach, the size of the city should be considered,\n            particularly if addressing sectors that do not have a clear\n            policy framework. 2) The new paradigm of democracy under the\n            new government, the decentralized, autonomous local\n            governments, and the financial crisis of 1997-98, led to\n            tremendous delays, mostly attributable to the quality of\n            leadership at the highest level of local government.\n            Therefore, when considering decentralized projects, it is\n            paramount to have commitments at the highest level of local\n            government, including those of the coordinating, and\n            implementing units."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

Impacts have been presented in\n            the Preliminary Environmental Assessment (PIL) reports in\n            the form of matrices of impact on the physical, biological\n            and sociological environment against project activities.\n            The SSUDP project is expected to have a positive overall\n            impact on the environment.  It will provide a clean water\n            supply to many families, reduce the non-sanitary disposal of\n            human and solid wastes, decrease flooding and improve the\n            living environment especially in the low income residential\n            areas.  Negative impacts of the project such as noise, dust\n            emission, socio-economic problems and traffic disruption\n            during the construction phase are minor and relatively short\n            term.
