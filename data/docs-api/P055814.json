The primary lesson indicates that\n            expanding EMAF (Export Market Access Fund)-like\n            public-private partnerships for effective export development\n            is more effective than purely public, and centralized\n            support. EMAF clients now pay half of the technical\n            assistance costs of export business development services,\n            and, surveys reflect that 60 percent are ready to cover the\n            full costs of export consultants. This demand-driven\n            approach has also simultaneously helped stimulate a new\n            local market of business development services, focused on\n            the export market. Success of this partnership depends upon\n            a delicate balance of public policy and financial support,\n            and a light, flexible and efficient private sector-like\n            program execution. The balance achieved in EMAF is essential\n            for the success of subsequent operations, and other such\n            programs. Notwithstanding, it is emphasized that a strong\n            and credible management team, cultivating good relations\n            with financial institutions is critical for schemes such as\n            the Pre-shipment Export Finance Guarantee (PEFG), that serve\n            as catalyst to address export financing constraints. Proper\n            promotion and marketing of the scheme is as important. For\n            PEFG-like schemes to succeed, key non-performance risks\n            should be addressed: the survey conducted among firms and\n            banks, confirmed that the instrument is needed, useful, and\n            effective, but it will not work unless the bad-faith issue\n            is addressed. Further lessons reinforce the importance of a\n            strong Government commitment, of collaboration and\n            coordination among the various agencies, of an established\n            trade regulatory framework, and, of simplified factors for\n            trade facilitation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -

The project will foster\n            export competitiveness of Tunisian firms by mitigating some\n            of the disadvantages they encounter relative to their\n            foreign competitors. There are three project components. 1)\n            Export market access will include a grant fund to cover on a\n            temporary basis up to 50 percent of the cost of consultant\n            services required to enable enterprises to enter export\n            markets. The component will offer its services solely in\n            response to private sector demand on a\n            first-come-first-serve basis. 2) Preshipment export finance\n            guarantee will encourage financial institutions to provide\n            preshipment financing to small enterprises medium\n            enterprises and emerging exporters with viable export\n            contracts whose perceived nonperformance risk is greater\n            than their actual risk because they are unable to provide\n            adequate collateral or do not have a suitable credit history\n            to prove that they are creditworthy. 3) Trade facilitation\n            component will support investments and technical assistance\n            required to reduce the number of procedures and transaction\n            costs involved in trading activity, with special emphasis on\n            customs procedures and electronic exchange of trade-related documents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Le projet de developpement des exportations"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisie \u2013 Le Projet de\n            d\u00e9veloppement des exportations : Le projet de d\u00e9veloppement\n            des exportations"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/04/4996080/tunisia-export-development-project-le-projet-de-developpement-des-exportations","projn":"TN-Export Development -- P055814","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040803165607"},"subsc":"Micro- and SME finance,Central government administration,Other domestic and international trade,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Export development;
