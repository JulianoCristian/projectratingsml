The Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, while the borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory.  The main lessons include: A) A\n            government-owned bank within a generally sound enabling\n            environment can reach out effectively and efficiently to\n            rural areas through wholesale operations when other private\n            players are reluctant to take risks in a challenging sector\n            or at a challenging economic time. B) It is important in a\n            rural finance project involving a government owned bank, to\n            analyze explicit and implicit subsidies for both the\n            institution and the sector to ascertain the levelness of the\n            playing field for non-government entrants. C) When poverty\n            alleviation is stated as a micro-finance objective it is\n            difficult to assess achievement without some form of\n            beneficiary impact assessment. D) There is a need for better\n            coordination between the Bank and IFC and resolution of\n            disputed areas of turf before project preparation work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines

Some\n            lessons learned included: using a sound wholesale financial\n            institution with a strong accreditation unit to appraise\n            participating financial institutions (PFIs), rather than\n            having the Bank review each one, can work satisfactorily in\n            a system where there are many potential PFIs. This type of\n            project is a suitable mechanism for disbursing a relatively\n            large number of loans quickly to the private sector without\n            placing much burden on government. Strong financial\n            institutions with qualified and experienced management and\n            staff at headquarters, branches and field offices, are\n            crucial to project
