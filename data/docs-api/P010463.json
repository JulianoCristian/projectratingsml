The ratings for the India Industrial\n            Pollution Prevention Project were as follows: Outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability was likely; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned included: 1) The Bank should\n            not go forward with new (even complementary follow-on)\n            projects that attempt to extend and/or replicate previously\n            untested design approaches when there has been insufficient\n            opportunity to monitor, evaluate and learn from the\n            implementation experience and results of the first\n            operation. Adequate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms are\n            also particularly important under these circumstances; 2) to\n            the extent possible the objectives of Bank-supported\n            environment projects should identify upfront the specific\n            outcomes they seek to achieve in terns of improvements in\n            environmental quality; 3) efforts should have been placed in\n            the context of more comprehensive national and local\n            pollution abatement strategies, involving the full range of\n            contributing sectors (in all likelihood including urban\n            sanitation, transport, energy and even agriculture, as well\n            as industry) and suitable actions to address air, water and\n            land degradation problems in a more spatially focused way;\n            4) project environmental outcomes may not have had a\n            significant impact in terns of improving overall ambient air\n            and water quality in the places where these industrial\n            plants are situated; 5) it is impossible to determine the\n            relative priority of addressing industrial, as compared with\n            other, sources of pollution at any particular locality, or\n            more generally. This should, in fact, have been the starting\n            point for Bank involvement in this regard; 6) by not taking\n            an area-based approach to addressing pollution problems, the\n            Bank missed an opportunity to implement one of its own\n            specific recommendations following its assessment of\n            Government of India's Environment Action Program in\n            1995; 7) the approach to industrial pollution management\n            through Industrial Pollution Control Project and Industrial\n            Pollution Prevention Project was also a partial one in that\n            it did not incorporate the full range of instruments which\n            could have potentially been used to achieve pollution\n            prevention and control objectives; and 8) in project\n            extension decisions, development effectiveness\n            considerations should take precedence over internal Bank\n            portfolio quality concerns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Lessons are as follows. There is a need to\n            strengthen the technical capacity of financial\n            intermediaries (FIs), before opening lines of credit aimed\n            at reducing, or preventing pollution, to avoid the delays\n            resulting from the FI's inability to screen, and\n            appraise sub-projects, and their inadequate comprehension of\n            the technical standards enforced by the Bank as a condition\n            for sub-loan approval. Furthermore, effective outreach\n            mechanisms supported by strong commitment from FI management\n            should be established, given that industrial borrowing is\n            sensitive to changes in interest rates, and perceived\n            transaction costs. Related to this, is the need for donor\n            coordination to harmonize credit terms within similar\n            on-lending operations, financed by different donors, or at\n            least to minimize the potential for confusion and overlap\n            between programs. Pollution prevention activities should be\n            focused on priority sites where the marginal benefits of\n            pollution reduction are high, and for monitoring systems\n            which can track local pollution trends over time. Therefore,\n            alternative mechanisms to spatially, or thematically target\n            polluting industries could also have been explored, with\n            complementary financial, and technical assistance. In any\n            case, a solid sub-project investment pipeline should have\n            been developed for at least the first project year.\n            Additionally, project components should be more carefully\n            linked with expected outcomes, taking into account the\n            likely time lag between efforts to strengthen regulatory\n            effectiveness, and observed changes in industrial behavior\n            to be encountered. Better analytic work before project\n            preparation might have helped regarding these issues, as\n            well as a substantial time, and level of effort for\n            preparation, and supervision, with technical inputs backed\n            by consistent management oversight and institutional memory\n            from internal reviews."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Industrial Pollution
