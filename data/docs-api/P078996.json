Ratings for\n            the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Poverty Reduction Credit\n            Project for Burkina Faso are as follows: outcomes of the\n            project were satisfactory, sustainability is moderate, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the Borrower was also rated\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the report are: 1)\n            PRSCs are useful instruments to help the borrower assume\n            increased responsibility in managing its public resources in\n            an efficient manner, notably by providing more flexibility\n            and predictability; however, there is a risk of complacency\n            and of dependence on continued foreign budget support; 2)\n            issues of attribution are inevitable when the reform\n            programs are supported by several donors; 3) since outcomes\n            are to be assessed after several years, the quality of the\n            relevant statistical data is critical; if insufficient,\n            preparation should include remedial actions, including the\n            selection and definition of baseline data; 4) since reforms\n            are of medium-to long-term nature, early identification of\n            institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints is of\n            paramount importance; and 5) to assess outcome of a\n            medium-term program, it is essential that the different\n            documents of a PRSC series be consistent in content and\n            format,

Fifth, and Sixth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) for Burkina Faso\n            are as follows: overall outcome of the all three PRSC's\n            series was satisfactory, risk to development outcome for all\n            three series was moderate, and the performance of the Bank\n            and the Borrower was also rated satisfactory for all three\n            series. Key lessons drawn from the implementation of PRSC-4\n            to 6 are follows: (i) country ownership. The use of the PRSC\n            instrument to support implementation of the poverty\n            reduction strategy has contributed to strengthen country\n            ownership. Specifically, this PRSC series greatly reinforced\n            the importance of the budget and the country's own\n            capacity for the success of government policies; (ii)\n            harmonization of budget support among donors. The creation\n            of the Cadre General d'Organisation des Appuis\n            Budgetaires (General Framework for Budget Support) (CGAB)\n            and its unified framework for budget support and joint\n            performance matrix provided an effective framework to\n            harmonize the dialogue and efforts of Burkina Faso's\n            development partners, including this PRSC series, with the\n            government's own strategy. In particular, it allowed\n            for early entry points in the policy dialogue with the\n            government and the identification of corrective measures or\n            solution to implementation bottlenecks. It also allowed for\n            all actors to make good use of analytical work. Furthermore,\n            close and continuous dialogue with the government allowed\n            CGAB members to better understand the constraints on the\n            reform process and build government ownership. This was\n            particularly relevant for some complex reform areas, like\n            cotton, decentralization, privatization and the reduction of\n            factor costs; and (iii) primacy of the cotton sector. Recent\n            developments in the cotton sector have highlighted the\n            importance of the sector for the country's\n            macroeconomic stability and growth, the need to adjust the\n            government strategy in the cotton sector to reflect recent\n            exogenous shocks and the importance of continued Bank\n            involvement in this sector. The increased focus of the third\n            PRSC series on reforms in the cotton sector reflects the\n            need to flexibly adjust the strategic orientation and\n            emphasis of the PRSCs. The lessons drawn from the experience\n            with cotton sector reform also show the need to broaden the\n            analysis of the risks inherent in the development of this sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Fourth, Fifth, and\n

Support\n            Credit (PRSC-6) Project is part of a series of operations\n            supporting the implementation of the Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP) for the period 2004-2006. The PRSP has\n            four strategic pillars: 1) accelerating broad-based growth;\n            2) promoting access to social services; 3) increasing\n            employment and income-generating activities for the poor;\n            and, 4) promoting good governance. The PRSC series supports\n            the PRSP implementation under three components consistent\n            with the four pillars of the PRSP: a) growth and employment\n            creation; b) human resource development; and, c) good\n            governance. Under the growth and employment creation\n            component, the PRSC-6 supports institutional reforms that\n            will increase private sector participation in the cotton,\n            telecommunication, and energy sectors, accelerating growth\n            through higher investment and improved productivity and\n            competitiveness. The second component includes policies to\n            lower the cost of services and improve access and quality in\n            the education, health, social protection, and water sectors.\n            The third component encompasses policy measures to\n            strengthen budget formulation, execution, procurement, and\n            control. This component also supports the strengthening of\n            public sector performance, greater decentralization, and\n            better environmental management. Project risks arise from\n            the country's weak institutional capacity, adverse\n            developments in commodity prices and exchange rates, and\n            regional instability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Sixth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Sixth Poverty\n            Reduction
