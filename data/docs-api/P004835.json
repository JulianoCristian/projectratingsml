In\n            addition, the project sought to move immediately into\n            nationwide implementation without testing procedures or\n            delivery mechanisms. As a result, the project was too\n            complex and demanding for proper implementation, bringing it\n            virtually to a standstill. In order for changes in education\n            management and service delivery to take root, it is critical\n            to take into account the institutional constraints and\n            capacity building requirements needed to ensure the\n            feasibility of implementation. Pedagogical and language\n            needs of ethnic minority children and remote area\n            communities have to be addressed comprehensively and\n            strategically. Although educational inputs are necessary\n            elements to improve educational quality, a key concern for\n            educational development is to measure their impact on\n            student learning. A strong monitoring and evaluation plan\n            must focus on development outcomes such as assessment of\n            learning achievement. Ministry line departments and agencies\n            must own and implement project technical interventions.\n            Integration of project technical activities into sectoral\n            programs
