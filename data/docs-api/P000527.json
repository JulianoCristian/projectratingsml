Some lessons learned included:\n            the Chad ESRP original results framework was weak with only\n            one Project Development Objective (PDO) indicator out of\n            seven specific to the project intervention (the other six\n            were meant to measure increases on a national scale) and the\n            intermediate outcome indicators included some measures of\n            activities that were not funded by the Project. Overall,\n            this resulted in the adoption of indicators which were not\n            well-aligned with project components, hindering the Bank and\n            the Government's ability to effectively measure\n            progress of the Project. Improving capacity requires\n            training on a continuous basis and a strong Technical\n            Assistance (TA) sub-component. The ESRP provided sound TA\n            and training to the CNC (Centre National des Curricula -\n            National Curricula Center) technical staff which was\n            supported over an extended period of time. This increased\n            the impact of the training and has had a lasting influence\n            on improved capacity. The challenge being faced now is\n            limiting staff turn-over and renewal of staff contracts to\n            ensure continuity and sustainability. Although design\n            problems were identified earlier and discussed extensively\n            with the Government, it was only two years after the\n            Mid-Term Review (MTR) that restructuring was finalized when\n            74 percent of the funds were already disbursed. Project\n            restructuring might have been undertaken earlier which would\n            have provided a greater opportunity to achieve better outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Education

  implementing its strategy to improve access to and equity of\n            education.

However, the EA specifies that land acquisition\n            or loss of income are not expected as a result of schools\n            construction. The EA recommends the use of standard\n            environmental guidelines, including community participation\n            in the process for re-vegetation propagation. Mitigation\n            measures address the need to establish one primary\n            decantation basin for each ten sand washers, as well as\n            restoration of borrow pits, and provision of latrines. The\n            use of cement and metal frames is strongly recommended to\n            prevent vector diseases, in line with sanitation\n            technologies. Appropriate site selection should identify the\n            location of water effluents, to include as well water\n            quality testing. During construction, soil surfaces should\n            be protected, ensuring adequate drainage from gutters, and\n            from wastewater collection points, while wastes, and solid\n            waste management control should be ensured through disposal\n            services. Public, and educational campaigns will contribute\n            to improved health, through the provision of health and\n            hygiene measures.

This goal is in line with the state policy\n            contained in the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction\n            of Poverty which states that all children should be ensured\n            a primary education of universal quality, eliminating\n            disparities in access to education, health, nutrition and\n            non-farm employment and establishing social safety nets\n            needed to improve living conditions of street children, the\n            disabled, women, old persons and other outcasts of society.\n            The negative environmental impacts of the project result\n            from construction of latrines and water points in terms of\n            disruption of living conditions, and production of solid and\n            liquid waste. The exploitation of quarries for extraction of\n            construction materials could also be sources of negative\n            impacts to the environment, which will require restorative\n            actions after use. Environmental impacts such as soil\n            erosion, pollution of soil and water, loss of vegetation,\n            and impacts due to increased waste solids and liquids may\n            come from the activities of construction of latrines and\n            wells and the opening and operation of quarries for building\n            materials.

In short, direct and indirect effects are expected\n            from: the pollution caused by uncontrolled discharge of\n            solid and liquid waste, noise, dust, risk of accidents, soil\n
