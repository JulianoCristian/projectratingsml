The lessons learned indicate that although the\n            selection of a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) as a\n            lending instrument for this project was well-justified and\n            understandable, after completion of the project, it is not\n            clear to what extent this project fulfilled the principles\n            of a LIL. The most beneficial aspect of the pilot approach\n            in education development comes from comparing various models\n            to solve a given problem. This requires that the experiments\n            within the pilot be carefully designed. First-time borrowers\n            always need more and different supervision than experienced\n            partners. This was well-recognized in the project documents\n            and early supervision memoranda. However, despite sufficient\n            time allocated to supervision by the Bank team, this project\n            shows that with more client-oriented and needs-based\n            supervision, some of the delays and other deficits in\n            implementation could have been either avoided or worked out\n            faster. The Monitoring and Evaluation (MOE) saw this project\n            as a potential engine for its own education sector reform\n            strategy. Therefore, one important aspect of this project\n            was to help the MOE, education authorities, principals and\n            teachers to understand educational change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -

There are two main components. The first,\n            supports curriculum reform by providing 1) international and\n            local consultant support on main areas of curriculum\n            development, including syllabus, teaching methods,\n            institutional issues, and assessment (including textbook\n            development) with an overall focus on greater subject\n            integration and on increasing optional courses in the upper\n            grades; 2) training, fellowships, and study tours; 3) civil\n            works, covering the refurbishment of two curriculum\n            development institutions; 4) resource materials, equipment,\n            and supplies; 5) syllabi, textbooks, and supplies; and 6)\n            operating costs. The second component supports capacity\n            building and reorientation of teacher education institutes\n            in pilot regions. It focuses on technical assistance on\n            teacher training and teaching methods, training of trainers,\n            minor rehabilitation, and financing training materials,\n            equipment, materials, and supplies. A select number of pilot\n            schools in pilot districts will be chosen to assess and\n            evaluate new curricula and teaching methods for selected\n            grades. In addition to financing textbooks, this component\n            supports training and outreach activities aimed at\n            strengthening parent and community involvement in school
