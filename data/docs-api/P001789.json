sustainability was uncertain, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: In a\n            complex and uncertain environment, marked by weak capacity\n            in the country, project design has to be well focused on the\n            key issues and constraints. Design should be clear and\n            preferably simple, and above all, focus on building the\n            capacity of the involved agencies. Implementers must be\n            diligent in enforcing appropriate policy measures. Without\n            such, the sustainability of physical improvements is\n            undermined While the design of project was fairly forward\n            looking in terms of the emphasis on policy reform,\n            especially cost recovery, implementation should have been\n            more aggressive in ensuring that more of the agreed upon\n            reforms were made. More emphasis needs to be put on creating\n            strong information systems and insisting on regular and\n            timely progress reporting, throughout the life of the\n            project. In the case of a ministry or similar government\n            implementing agency, such systems should be applicable to\n            general operations as well as to the project. One of the\n            most useful outputs that a project may leave behind is a\n            reliable information system, and more generally, an\n            appreciation on the part of the implementing agency of the\n            importance of timely and accurate information."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -
