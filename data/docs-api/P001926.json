The following\n            lessons may be drawn from the experience of this project: 1)\n            Keyfactors for a successful infrastructure port reform\n            project are strong commitment from government, consistency\n            of political will even when administrations change, and an\n            inclusive participatory approach with a broad consultation\n            process. 2) A good monitoring indicator system can help a\n            port operator to adapt both its operating strategy and\n            productivity level quickly when it needs to respond to\n            changes in market demand. 3) Once a port has proved to be\n            commercially successful, private sector investment should be\n            a strong option for any future development, since its\n            viability will encourage potential investors to take on the\n            risks involved.

Lessons of success are attributed, first, to a\n            consistent political will, government commitment, and strong\n            ownership, irrespective of administration changes. Likewise,\n            the participatory approach, and consultation process helped\n            dilute social risks, during project preparation,\n            negotiations, and implementation, especially with trade\n            unions, and, in particular, the Master Plan Study\n            participatory management, and appropriate Project Steering\n            Committee complemented the nature of this project. The\n            project is thus looked upon as a role model in the\n            implementation of projects in Mauritius, a project which was\n            instrumental in creating a new vision for port management,\n            as well as for social aspects with the introduction of the\n            Voluntary Retirement Scheme concept. Regardless of success,\n            the exchange risk issue, faced by the Mauritius Ports\n            Authority (MPA), exposed the limitations of the existing\n            financial market arrangements, to a large extent, beyond\n            MPA's control. This suggests the Government should\n            consider other financial instruments, to provide\n            institutional ability to hedge against foreign exchange\n            risks; similarly, the Bank should consider introducing some\n            mechanisms/formula to limit client's exposure on\n            foreign exchange as a percentage of its revenue."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius -
