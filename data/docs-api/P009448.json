The following lessons are drawn from the\n            experience of these two projects: 1) in designing\n            institutional development (ID) project components, the\n            incentives for those directly concerned by proposed changes\n            should be well aligned with the project objectives. In\n            particular, the staffing and remuneration implications of\n            major institutional reorganizations (such as the creation of\n            GTCL), need to be well understood, and explicitly addressed,\n            if reorganizations are to be successfully implemented; 2)\n            building a strong gas industry of international standard,\n            requires a major ID effort: better management, greatly\n            increased training, better remuneration, and more autonomy;\n            3) the Bank should take a less dogmatic approach to sector\n            reforms, and practice greater sensitivity to local,\n            socio-political constraints, if it is to achieve\n            collaborative dialog, and succeed in obtaining the Borrower\n            'buy-in' to its proposals; and, 4) when the Bank\n            finds it difficult to justify its support for a particular\n            sector, due to policy differences, it should - strategically\n            - weigh the benefits of maintaining a flexible form of\n            engagement against the consequences of full withdrawal.\n            Repeated sharp changes in the Bank's involvement could\n            be damaging to its credibility, and could constrain its\n            ability to seek policy reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Gas Development, and Gas\n            Infrastructure Development Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Gas\n            Development, and Gas Infrastructure Development Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/07/4993332/bangladesh-second-gas-development-gas-infrastructure-development-projects","projn":"BD-Gas Infrastructure Development -- P009533,BD-Gas Development Ii-114489 -- P009448","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Transport and Environment,Oil & Gas,Energy Trade,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040803093648"},"subsc":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development,Telecommunications,Oil and gas,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"broad range,construction,energy\n            consumption,energy portfolio,Energy Sector,energy\n            supply,energy use,Gas,Gas Development,Gas Development\n            project,gas exports,gas field,gas field development,Gas\n            Fields,gas flow,gas industry,Gas Infrastructure,Gas\n            Infrastructure Development,gas pipeline,gas pipelines,gas\n            price,gas prices,Gas pricing,gas processing,gas\n            production,gas projects,gas reserves,gas resources,gas\n            sector,gas supplies,gas supply,Gas Transmission,Gas\n            Transmission Company,gas transmission network,gas\n            treatment,Gas Utilization,Gas Utilization\n            Study,gas-producing countries,hydrocarbons,Mineral,Natural\n            gas,natural gas prices,natural resources,offshore\n            gas,Oil,oil and gas,oil and gas sector,oil companies,Oil\n            Company,oil imports,petroleum,petroleum\n            sector,pipeline,pipelines,power generation,sustainable\n            use,transmission system,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"broad range,construction,energy\n            consumption,energy portfolio,Energy Sector,energy\n            supply,energy use,Gas,Gas Development,Gas Development\n            project,gas exports,gas field,gas field development,Gas\n            Fields,gas flow,gas industry,Gas Infrastructure,Gas\n            Infrastructure Development,gas pipeline,gas pipelines,gas\n            price,gas prices,Gas pricing,gas processing,gas\n            production,gas projects,gas reserves,gas resources,gas\n            sector,gas supplies,gas supply,Gas Transmission,Gas\n            Transmission Company,gas transmission network,gas\n            treatment,Gas Utilization,Gas Utilization\n            Study,gas-producing countries,hydrocarbons,Mineral,Natural\n            gas,natural gas prices,natural resources,offshore\n            gas,Oil,oil and gas,oil and gas sector,oil companies,Oil\n            Company,oil imports,petroleum,petroleum\n            sector,pipeline,pipelines,power generation,sustainable\n            use,transmission system,wells"}},"owner":"Knowledge and Information Servs. (IMTKI),Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020350-DANISH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF023450-CANADIAN CONSULTANT TF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF025180-PHRD-GAS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT,TF026081-USTDA CTF,TF028184-REG.

The objectives of the SGDP, as stated in the\n            Staff Appraisal Report, were to: (a) expand gas supplies in\n            line with expected incremental gas demand over the medium\n            term; (b) produce the country's first significant\n            quantities of condensate from the Kailashtila and Beani\n            Bazar gas fields; (c) initiate an appraisal program for the\n            country's main gas fields; and (d) strengthen the\n            management and operational capability of Petrobangla and its\n            operating companies. Despite a three-and-a half year\n            implementation the project achieved its main objectives of\n            gas production and gas field appraisal. There are several\n            key lessons to be learned from the project. The primary\n            causes of difficulty and delay during project implementation\n            were directly related to delayed procurement actions by the\n            Borrower. Future projects should be designed commensurate\n            with the management capacity of the implementing agency, and\n            specifically mandate advance procurement decisions. By\n            negotiations, all preparatory and design work should be\n            completed for the first two years, and should be ready for\n            tendering and award by effectiveness. Staff trained in\n            procurement should be on board in the implementing agency\n            prior to appraisal of a proposed project. Project\n            Implementation Units are useful entities to coordinate\n            implementation activities of a project, especially one as\n            complex as the SGDP. However, care must be taken not to\n            imbed disincentives to completion. Another lesson learned\n            relates to co-financing. A final lesson is it may be\n            preferable for IDA to finance smaller and less complex\n            projects in a desired sequential order to achieve greater\n            success in meeting development objectives. This would ensure\n            that the absorptive capacity of the Borrower is not\n            over-burdened, and that future investments are based on\n            assumptions that are both realistic and achievable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Gas Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Gas\n            Development

strengthen its management capability,\n            particularly in the areas of field management and production\n            planning. The project will consist of: (a) a gas field\n            appraisal and development component that will comprise the\n            drilling of nine wells, the workover of two existing wells,\n            and a reservoir study for each producing field; (b) a gas\n            infrastructure component to bring the gas fields of\n            Kailashtila, Beani Bazar, and Rashidpur into production,\n            involving the construction of an approximately 117-mile long\n            gas pipeline with the necessary gas and condensate treatment\n            facilities; and (c) pilot CNG applications; and (d) training\n            and technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
