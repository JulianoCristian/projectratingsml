All the major\n            equipment components are manufactured in India, and there is\n            adequate understanding of and experience with their installation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Farakka Thermal Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second Farakka Thermal\n            Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/05/741615/india-second-farakka-thermal-power-project","projn":"IN-Farakka II Thermal P -- P009824","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3971023104328"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"boilers,charcoal,civil\n            engineering,Coal,coal,Coal prices,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,Construction,construction equipment,domestic\n            use,Ecology,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic development,economic\n            growth,electric potential,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,ELECTRICITY BOARDS,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity demand,electricity\n            prices,Electricity Supply,energy conservation,Energy\n            Consumption,Energy Generation,energy intensity,energy\n            policy,energy prices,Energy Pricing,Energy Resources,ENERGY\n            SECTOR,energy supply,energy utilization,Engineering,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fuel,fuel substitution,fuels,gas,gas\n            production,gas\n            reserves,generator,grid,hydrocarbons,imports,Income,Insurance,irrigation,kerosene,Marginal\n            Cost,natural gas,nuclear power,oil,oil\n            equivalent,OPEC,Organization of Petroleum Exporting\n            Countries,Petroleum,power companies,power consumption,power\n            development,power generation,power industry,power\n            plant,Power Plants,power projects,Power Sector,power\n            stations,Power Supply,power system,power systems,Power\n            Transmission,pressure,primary energy,producers,proven\n            reserves,Renewable energy,Renewable energy\n            resources,renewable energy supply,Rural\n            Electrification,State power,Taxation,Thermal Power,thermal\n            power plants,utilities,Voltage,waste,wholesale price index"},"1":{"cdata!":"boilers,charcoal,civil\n            engineering,Coal,coal,Coal prices,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,Construction,construction equipment,domestic\n            use,Ecology,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic development,economic\n            growth,electric potential,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,ELECTRICITY BOARDS,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity demand,electricity\n            prices,Electricity Supply,energy conservation,Energy\n            Consumption,Energy Generation,energy intensity,energy\n            policy,energy prices,Energy Pricing,Energy Resources,ENERGY\n            SECTOR,energy supply,energy utilization,Engineering,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fuel,fuel substitution,fuels,gas,gas\n            production,gas\n            reserves,generator,grid,hydrocarbons,imports,Income,Insurance,irrigation,kerosene,Marginal\n            Cost,natural gas,nuclear power,oil,oil\n            equivalent,OPEC,Organization of Petroleum Exporting\n            Countries,Petroleum,power companies,power consumption,power\n            development,power generation,power industry,power\n            plant,Power Plants,power projects,Power Sector,power\n            stations,Power Supply,power system,power systems,Power\n            Transmission,pressure,primary energy,producers,proven\n            reserves,Renewable energy,Renewable energy\n            resources,renewable energy supply,Rural\n            Electrification,State power,Taxation,Thermal Power,thermal\n            power plants,utilities,Voltage,waste,wholesale price index"}},"owner":"South Asia Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"4967"},"facets":{}}}
