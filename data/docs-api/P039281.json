The lessons learned indicate that funding\n            requirements of such large projects need to be more formally\n            committed than was the case for Ghazi Barotha Hydropower\n            Project (GBHP). The environmental aspects of GBHP are mainly\n            positive, in that it obviates the need for a comparable\n            sized (thermal) generation plant, and thereby reduces the\n            damaging atmospheric impacts of such plants. The key areas\n            where innovative approaches were pioneered under GBHP were:\n            (a) the involvement of affectees in the valuation of land\n            and other assets, and (b) the retrofit of past legacy issues\n            onto a new Project-by attempting to address the outstanding\n            compensation and claims of the Tarbela Dam Project as a\n            component of GBHP. In both cases, there was limited or no\n            precedent in Pakistan which could have served as a guide for\n            the Government or Water and Power Development Authority\n            (WAPDA), when issues arose. Some of these problems may have\n            been handled more expeditiously if the concerned officials\n            were exposed to similar conditions in other countries or\n            projects, and the Bank could have taken a more active role\n            in providing such exposure or first hand examples."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Ghazi Barotha\n            Hydropower Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4654190/pakistan-ghazi-barotha-hydropower-project","projn":"PK-Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Project -- P039281","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,Water and Energy,Business Environment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040701103826"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability,accounting,acquisition,actual\n            cost,actual costs,ADB,average annual generation,Bank\n            Performance,Climate change,contractors,cost\n            estimates,Dams,EIB,electricity demand,electricity\n            generation,entitlements,Exchange Rate,expenditure,Financial\n            Restructuring,FISCAL YEAR,Hydropower,hydropower\n            generation,hydropower projects,hydropower\n            units,income,Institutional Development,Islamic Development\n            Bank,land prices,large hydropower,Load\n            shedding,oil,operating costs,Pollution,power\n            generation,Power Sector\n            Reform,privatization,procurement,Producers,Quality\n            Assurance,Quality Assurance Group,Structural\n            Adjustment,sustainable development,Technical\n            Assistance,utility functions"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accountability,accounting,acquisition,actual\n            cost,actual costs,ADB,average annual generation,Bank\n            Performance,Climate change,contractors,cost\n            estimates,Dams,EIB,electricity demand,electricity\n            generation,entitlements,Exchange Rate,expenditure,Financial\n            Restructuring,FISCAL YEAR,Hydropower,hydropower\n            generation,hydropower projects,hydropower\n            units,income,Institutional Development,Islamic Development\n            Bank,land prices,large hydropower,Load\n            shedding,oil,operating costs,Pollution,power\n            generation,Power Sector\n            Reform,privatization,procurement,Producers,Quality\n            Assurance,Quality Assurance Group,Structural\n            Adjustment,sustainable development,Technical\n            Assistance,utility functions"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022514-PHRD-PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE DEV.,TF025217-PHRD-GHAZI-BAROTHA HYDROPOWER\n            PROJ.

The project\n            will consist of: 1) the construction of the Ghazi Barotha\n            Hydropower Project (GBHP) which comprises the following four\n            main components: a) a barrage and its ancillary works; b) a\n            52 km long concrete-lined power channel with a capacity of\n            1,600 cumecs and its ancillary works; c) a power complex and\n            its ancillary works; and d) the construction of power\n            transmission facilities to connect GBHP to the\n            interconnected grid; 2) the implementation of an environment\n            and resettlement management plan including: a) an\n            environment mitigation and monitoring plan; b) a\n            resettlement action plan (RAP); and c) and integrated\n            regional development plan (IRDP); 3) the power sector\n            component which involves setting up of GBHP as a separate\n            project entity and the establishment of a separate\n            transmission and despatch entity;
