Some lessons learned includes: the choice of\n            instruments and policy measures for an emergency food crisis\n            intervention needs to take into account the local causes of\n            poverty and hunger. In the case of the Burundi food crisis\n            operation, recent sector work emphasized the centrality of\n            long-run constraints to agricultural productivity to these\n            problems, while the analysis in the program document gave\n            the impression that the main problem for Burundi was\n            short-term in nature caused by the 2007-08 spikes in world\n            commodity prices. For budget support as for other\n            operations, it is difficult to assess results in the absence\n            of a clear framework setting out links between policy\n            actions, outputs, and outcomes and of baseline measures of\n            the outcomes against which progress can be measured. The\n            food crisis grant operation for Burundi did not clearly\n            specify the links between the various actions that were\n            supported and the outcomes underpinning project objectives.\n            Scaling up of safety nets is a common strategy in an\n            emergency situation, but expanding a program to new areas\n            may take time. In the case of Burundi, not all schools had\n            the necessary infrastructure to support the feeding program,\n            and local management had to be put in place in the new areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Food Crisis Response Development\n            Policy Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Food Crisis Response\n            Development

Development\n            Policy Grant (DPG) Project for Burundi of US$10 million\n            supports the Government's program to mitigate the\n            impact of increased food prices on the poor, while\n            maintaining fiscal stability. This in turn will help reduce\n            the risk of worsened food insecurity, increased poverty,\n            social unrest, and will help foster social and economic\n            development. This grant helps to finance the revised 2008\n            budget which includes a number of measures, notably: (i)\n            suspension of custom duties and domestic transaction taxes\n            on thirteen basic food items; (ii) sustaining or extending\n            school feeding programs (including for girls) in primary\n            schools of vulnerable provinces; and (iii) adding more\n            resources to the budget for the emergency humanitarian\n            relief to cope with a threat of famine in the country\n            following the drought. Other components of the revised\n            budget attempt to address the fuel price increases and limit\n            increases in transport costs, to which the poor are\n            particularly vulnerable. The provision of budget financing\n            will enable the Government to maintain the gains in\n            macroeconomic stability, sustain the critical reforms under\n            the Economic Reform Support Grant (ERSG) program, and\n            undertake critical expenditures to respond to the food price\n            shock. The development community is supporting\n            Burundi's medium term poverty reduction strategy, and\n            it is critical that the momentum of the reform program be\n            maintained. The food response grant financing will\n            complement other support from bilateral and multilateral\n            agencies for mitigating the risks to Burundi's overall\n            program. It will also support the Government's\n            medium-term reform agenda for putting in place a better\n            safety net system that improves Burundi's resilience\n            and response
