It includes (a) construction of a 70\n            meter high earth dam on the Guatape River, inlet and\n            discharge tunnels, and an underground power station with\n            four generating units, as well as related transmission\n            facilities; (b) consultant services for engineering, civil\n            works and supervision; and (c) a study of power losses to\n            ascertain their nature, size and occurrence as a basis for\n            recommending a program to minimize them. Once completed, the\n            San Carlos I station will be the largest power generating\n            facility within the integrated system, with an installed\n            capacity of 620 MW.
