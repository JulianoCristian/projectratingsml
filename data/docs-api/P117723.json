Ratings for the Second Phase of\n            the 135 Programs Supports Credit Project was as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the One-Two Public\n            Investment Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: excessive flexibility regarding the policy\n            content of a programmatic series weakens the program.\n            Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy\n            lending, there is room for striking a better balance between\n            flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially met triggers\n            as prior actions should be considered with particular\n            caution. Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and\n            other external partners to withdraw their support for weakly\n            implemented reform programs and unproductive policy dialogue\n            can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations.\n            The delays in the second operations of P135 and PIR, and\n            PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns with program\n            quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in\n            the case of P135. Arguments for budget predictability under\n            the Paris Declaration are less relevant in Vietnam due to\n            relatively small share of budget support in public\n            expenditures. A strong knowledge base is of critical\n            importance for upstream design of reforms and parallel\n            technical assistance to support their implementation.\n            Selectivity

- First and Second Public\n            Investment Reform Development Policy Operation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the First and Second Public\n            Investment Reform Development Policy Operation Project were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was low; Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: an important\n            lesson learned is that it is difficult to achieve\n            significant institutional strengthening in the short time\n            frame of a development policy operation prepared for crisis\n            response. The Bank's decision to design the crisis\n            response as a thematic Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            focusing on a high priority reform area was correct and paid\n            off in terms of garnering the attention of top policy makers\n            on this issue. There is plenty of evidence, as detailed\n            earlier, about the Government's commitment on making\n            progress on reforming the public investment system and\n            restructuring the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) sector. The\n            Bank will need to work effectively with a range of\n            stakeholders, especially in the public investment area,\n            given the decentralization of decision-making authority on\n            public investments and the challenge to Ministry of Planning\n            and Investment (MPI) in leading the reform process in this\n            decentralized environment. It was not feasible for the Bank\n            to engage more deeply with the other key stakeholders, in\n            particular the provinces, in the limited time frame of the\n            Public Investment Reform (PIR) series, but this engagement\n            will be necessary going forward with the successor Economic\n            Management and Competitiveness Credit (EMCC) operation. For\n            smooth implementation of DPLs, consideration of potential\n            time needed for the completion of triggers must take into\n            account the following factors: (i) borrower's\n            procedures for issuing legal documents and (ii) potential\n            coordination issues among borrower's agencies. The two\n            programmatic operations had a number of triggers that dealt\n            with issuance or preparation of legal documents that\n            required a considerable amount of time for the government to\n            complete the internal procedures not only within the cabinet\n            but also requires the interaction with the national assembly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam

Investment Reform Development Policy Loan Program is to\n            support modern governance, one of the four main\n            'pillars' of Vietnam's Socio-Economic\n            Development Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010. The Country Partnership\n            Strategy (CPS) is aligned to the SEDP. Better planning\n            processes, more transparent procurement and stronger public\n            financial management, all areas covered by the program, fall\n            under the modern governance pillar of SEDP. The program is\n            designed to assist the government of Vietnam to strengthen\n            the selection, preparation, implementation and supervision\n            of public investment projects. While much progress has been\n            made over the last decade in the upgrading of public\n            financial management in relation to recurrent expenditures,\n            there are still important weaknesses in the management of\n            investment projects. Those weaknesses take a toll on\n            economic efficiency in a country where total investment\n            accounted for 41.3 percent of the Gross Domestic Product\n            (GDP) in 2008, and consolidated public sector investment for\n            12.6 percent. An increased focus on the quality of growth,\n            in addition to its quantity, is warranted. The recent\n            international macroeconomic turbulence has dramatically\n            exposed the weaknesses of public investment in Vietnam.\n            Distorted price signals resulted in capital expenditures\n            going to sectors experiencing asset price bubbles, thus\n            amplifying macroeconomic fluctuations. Insufficiently\n            developed monitoring mechanisms also made it difficult for\n            the government to adjust investment volumes so that they\n            will play a more counter-cyclical role."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - First Public Investment Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - First Public Investment\n            Reform
