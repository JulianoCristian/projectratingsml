Some lessons\n            learned included: organized beneficiary farmers, having\n            witnessed the impact of technological change and better land\n            management practices on their lands, are now poised to\n            exploit the productive benefits they were promised as a\n            result. Further, the micro-catchments is an effective forum\n            for rural organization and planning important for more\n            complex productive and other activities and a building block\n            for exploring and facilitating territorial and/or regional\n            development approaches. First-cycle micro-catchments\n            projects need to build installed capacity to more rapidly\n            and successfully execute follow-up operations. The\n            inevitable result is the short time available under the\n            initial project to capitalize on and consolidate acquired\n            knowledge and experience. Scaling-up should be balanced with\n            further innovation under follow-on operations. There is a\n            need to continuously 'sell' the project rationale,\n            objectives and results to senior authorities, budget\n            officials and policy makers across the political spectrum,\n            in all related agencies, and beyond the rural sector. Visits\n            by authorities to the project area/micro-catchments to\n            demonstrate project activities and impact, and meet\n            beneficiaries and local collaborators, are

agricultural extension that modifies the current\n            product-focused extension, towards one focused on the\n            microcatchment productivity systems in which families and\n

  agro-ecological mapping at the microcatchment level in soil\n            classification and land use planning, and resource\n            information; 2) an adaptive agricultural research component,\n            which finances of specialized services, infrastructure,\n            field equipment, and inputs for research trials, and\n            incremental operating costs;  3) an incentive program for\n            natural resources management and conservation component,\n            which finances: environmental education, an incentives fund\n            for soil management and conservation and pollution control,\n            an incentive for recovery of degraded lands, reforestation,\n            and enforcement of the soil use law and of project\n            incentives; 4) an erosion control works in the rural roads\n            component, an integral part part of the microcatchment\n            interventions, consisting of minor reshaping of road\n            profiles, with shoulder remodeling, various drainage and\n            erosion control works, and road regraveling; 5) training and\n            dissemination; and 6) project coordination and
