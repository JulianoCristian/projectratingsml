Some lessons\n            learned includes: integrated urban upgrading, Water Supply\n            and Sanitation (WSS) and housing approach. The integrated\n            urban upgrading approach used during the project improved\n            efficiency, reduced project risks, promoted synergies\n            between the various upgrading activities and increased the\n            magnitude of the results. It allowed the implementing\n            agencies to build their capacity to work in a coordinated\n            manner. In addition, the project found the division of the\n            targeted areas into Sanitation Collection Unit (UEs) to be\n            immensely useful. Reducing design complexities: the\n            involvement of the municipalities as both implementing\n            agencies and co-financiers proved to be important for the\n            outcomes of the project and for future sustainability.\n            However, this management model also led to difficulties in\n            implementation and coordination. Issues such as municipal\n            autonomy, distinct technical and managerial capacities and\n            financial constraints contributed to project delays and\n            required high level intervention from the Governor and\n            Mayors. Enforcing clear cut-off dates for resettlement. The\n            Bank's resettlement policy recommends setting a cutoff\n            date at the same time that the census is completed. After\n            this date, no entitlements should be offered to people who\n            settle in the area or make improvements to their homes or\n            businesses. Under the project, resettlement was carried out\n            in stages, and the project did not enforce the cutoff dates\n            for resettlement eligibility. Rebalancing pre and post\n            construction activities: the project focused on improving\n            the living conditions of the residents of the basin through\n            infrastructure and housing upgrades. The project did not\n            place equal emphasis on how to sustain its results and\n            promote the autonomy of the families. Slum upgrading\n            projects usually have more intensive social and community\n            development at the planning and implementation stages than\n            at the post-implementation stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Recife Urban Upgrading Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Recife Urban Upgrading Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/08/16773038/brazil-recife-urban-upgrading-project","projn":"BR-Recife Urban Upgrading Project -- P049265","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Slums Upgrading,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Services to the Poor,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120927013302"},"theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Urban services and housing for the poor,Participation and civic engagement,Land administration and management","subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Solid waste management,Housing construction","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access roads, accessibility, accounting,\n            air, asset management, auditing, auditors, autonomy, Bank\n            Ratings, banks, basic services, building regulations, bus,\n            bus terminal, capacity building, CDS, cities, communities,\n            community development, community participation, cost of\n            capital, decentralization, deposits, description,\n            devolution, drainage, drainage services, dust, dwellings,\n            economic development, employment, engineers, Environmental\n            policies, Financial Management, financial uncertainty, flow\n            of traffic, Gender, gender issues, hedonic price, historic\n            buildings, home owners, homes, households, houses, Housing,\n            Housing construction, housing development, housing\n            developments, housing financing, housing for the poor,\n            housing prices, housing subsidies, Housing units, informal\n            settlements, infrastructure investment, infrastructure\n            projects, institutional development, Intervention,\n            interventions, key performance indicators, land tenure, land\n            use, laws, legal framework, legislation, living conditions,\n            metropolitan areas, mixed use, mobility, Municipal\n            Development, Municipal Governments, municipalities,\n            neighborhoods, occupation, pedestrian, pedestrian paths,\n            pedestrians, Pollution, Pollution Control, present value,\n            privatization, Property Taxes, public parks, public\n            services, public transport, public transportation, rental\n            housing, rents, Resettlement, residences, residential areas,\n            risk management, road, road improvements, safety,\n            Sanitation, settlements, sewage, shelter, sidewalks, slum,\n            slum upgrading, slums, social capital, social services,\n            solid waste collection, squatter, squatter settlements,\n            squatters, street lighting, streets, technical assistance,\n            traffic, traffic flow, transparency, transport, transport\n            systems, urban areas, urban communities, urban development,\n            urban environment, urban housing, urban infrastructure,\n            urban planning, urban poor, urban poverty, Urban services,\n            URBAN UPGRADING, urban upgrading Projects, Urbanization,\n            utilities, waste, water collection, water meters, Water\n            Supply, wealth"}},"owner":"Disaster Risk Management & Urban (LCSDU)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF025483-PHRD-RECIFE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR\n            THE POOR PROJECT,TF033764-LATIN AMERICA - WATER SUPPLY\n            (ARGENTINA, PARAGUAY),TF035364-BRAZIL - URB.-FAV.
