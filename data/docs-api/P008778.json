The first lesson conveys it may\n            be preferable, under certain circumstances, to opt for a\n            simple project that focuses on the most urgent\n            rehabilitation needs, rather than aim for comprehensive, but\n            time-consuming alternatives. In this particular operation,\n            most of the rehabilitation works were such that would both\n            benefit from continued operations by a public operator, as\n            well as by a private concessionaire. Second, it is advisable\n            to defer large and costly investments, e.g., water, and\n            wastewater treatment plants, when the potential for demand\n            management alternatives to meet a city's consumption\n            exist. The project rightly concentrated on resolving\n            weaknesses as a cheaper way of balancing supply and demand,\n            and, improving quality compared to increasing treatment\n            capacity. Third, it is important to invest early in improved\n            data bases, through an operation that focuses on expanded\n            metering, and modernizes the public operator's\n            commercial system. Ideally, a set of baseline data should be\n            created prior to project inception, and performance\n            indicators monitored through the project implementation\n            period. Fourth, reliable regulation of both the quality, and\n            service delivery of either public or private operations is\n            paramount. However, the success of regulation is contingent\n            upon the timely submission of accurate data from the private\n            concessionaire. Given the information asymmetry inherent in\n            such arrangements, it may be necessary to strengthen the\n            monitoring of the concessionaire's performance,\n            possibly including the commissioning of periodic consumer\n            satisfaction surveys."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -

Lessons learned from the project\n            implementation include: 1) The Bank was right to resist\n            engaging in the preparation of a large-scale and complex\n            operation and to focus on an operation with a relatively\n            simple design given that the beneficiary had no prior\n            experience in the implementation of externally financed\n            projects. 2) The Bank insisted on using international\n            procurement although a majority of the contracts were of a\n            nature and size unlikely to attract serious international\n            firms. The fact is that under the international umbrella the\n            bulk of contract work was provided by local contractors with\n            the external firms playing a mere role of coordinator. A\n            larger openness to the local contracting industry would have\n            eliminated some of the difficulties faced by the project. 3)\n            While promoting the involvement of private operators in the\n            delivery of local utility services is a major strategic\n            objective for the Bank, it must be recognized that it lacks\n            the flexibility of a commercial bank and cannot easily\n            respond to the changing needs of a beneficiary by adjusting\n            terms and conditions of its loans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -
