Furthermore, the proposed project\n            intends to test extension strategies in 20 of Mexico's\n            192 Rural Development Districts (RDD).  The project areas\n            are representative of two of the country's four major\n            agroecological zones; the irrigated areas of the arid\n            northwest and the temperate central highlands.  The project\n            intends to finance:  (a) training programs for extension\n            personnel, researchers and farmers; (b) construction of\n            limited office facilities at the Secretariat of Agriculture\n            and Hydraulic Resources (SARH) service centers; (c)\n            procurement of vehicles and equipment for extension and\n            research personnel; and (d) recurrent expenditures of the\n            extension service."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Agricultural Extension (PROCATI) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Agricultural Extension\n            (PROCATI) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/05/740541/mexico-agricultural-extension-procati-project","projn":"MX-Ag Extnsn -- P007593","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,ICT Policy and Strategies,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Information and Communication Technologies,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926055256"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Information and Communication Technologies,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Research,agricultural trade,Agriculture,Bank\n            lending,budgetary support,commodities,competitive\n            bidding,cost effectiveness,debt,demand for food,development\n            projects,economics,effective\n            use,elasticity,employment,equipment,exchange rate,experiment\n            stations,exports,extension services,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,feasibility studies,feed,food\n            demand,Forestry,Forestry Research,fruits,GDP,Government\n            expenditures,gross value,growth rate,imports,income,income\n            elasticity of demand,incomes,inflation,inflation\n            rates,infrastructure investments,Insurance,integrated pest\n            management,interest rate,interest rates,irrigation,labor\n            force,legislation,Livestock,Livestock\n            Research,Maize,management methods,Marketing,media,oil,oil\n            prices,population growth,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,Programming,public\n            services,research programs,Research results,Rural\n            Development,rural poverty,soil conservation,structural\n            adjustment,technical assistance,trade balance,training\n            courses,training programs,transfer of technology,vegetables,wealth"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural production,Agricultural\n            Research,agricultural trade,Agriculture,Bank\n            lending,budgetary support,commodities,competitive\n            bidding,cost effectiveness,debt,demand for food,development\n            projects,economics,effective\n            use,elasticity,employment,equipment,exchange rate,experiment\n            stations,exports,extension services,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,feasibility studies,feed,food\n            demand,Forestry,Forestry Research,fruits,GDP,Government\n            expenditures,gross value,growth rate,imports,income,income\n            elasticity of demand,incomes,inflation,inflation\n            rates,infrastructure investments,Insurance,integrated pest\n            management,interest rate,interest rates,irrigation,labor\n            force,legislation,Livestock,Livestock\n            Research,Maize,management methods,Marketing,media,oil,oil\n            prices,population growth,price\n            controls,producers,productivity,Programming,public\n            services,research programs,Research results,Rural\n            Development,rural poverty,soil conservation,structural\n            adjustment,technical assistance,trade balance,training\n            courses,training programs,transfer of technology,vegetables,wealth"}},"owner":"WB Off:Mexico - MX & CO CMU (LCC1C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"6620"},"facets":{}}}
