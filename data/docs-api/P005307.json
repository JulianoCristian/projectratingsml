The project was\n            extended three times during implementation as a result of\n            delayed project implementation and delays in the\n            construction of civil works and the procurement of\n            equipment.  Both the Gulf War of 1991 and frequent changes\n            of Ministry of Education (MOE) officials affected project\n            implementation and outcome.  The project provides the\n            following key lessons: (i) Greater care to design a\n            comprehensive evaluation program prior to the acceptance of\n            school buildings and other works by the responsible\n            ministry. (ii) Complex projects must have clear and\n            measurable objectives, and an effective monitoring and\n            evaluation system prior to project effectiveness. (iii)\n            Projects with a substantial capital construction component\n            must include a comprehensive component or sub-component to\n            addresses maintenance. (iv) Effective monitoring and\n            evaluation is fundamental for a complex project and projects\n            should consider contracting out this function with both\n            qualitative and quantitative indicators. (v) The project\n            director must be responsible for all implementation issues\n            have adequate time for project implementation matters,\n            while more complex projects should have a project director\n            in each ministry. (vi) A two tier institutional structure\n            can provide intellectual rigor and independent oversight\n            apart from more traditional oversight agencies. (vii) Future\n            school building projects should involve local participation\n            in deciding new building location and design, with emphasis\n            on the construction of low maintenance buildings in existing\n            schools. (viii) High caliber technical assistance is\n            critical for an effective training program. (ix) Ensure\n            trainers are competent and adequate materials are available.\n            Also ensure that: the environment and timing is conducive to\n            effective learning; there is a suitable incentive system;\n            and there is an effective and ongoing monitoring and\n            evaluation program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Second Human Resources Sector\n
