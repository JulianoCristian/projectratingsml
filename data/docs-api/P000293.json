The\n            main project objectives were to: (a) gradually build the\n            organizational technical and financial capacities of the\n            municipalities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso to enable\n            them to assume responsibility for contracting the\n            maintenance of urban infrastructure and the supply of urban\n            services, and cope with a rapidly growing urban population;\n            and (b) improve the infrastructure of these two cities to an\n            acceptable level so that effective routine maintenance can\n            be provided. The project achieved, and in some cases\n            exceeded, its objectives, both in terms of institutional\n            aspects and physical objectives. The Bank's performance\n            was satisfactory. Staff continuity during supervision was\n            satisfactory. The Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory overall, although deficient during project\n            start-up. The key lesson to be drawn from this project is\n            that for an urban investment program to be successful it\n            must have the support of its principal partners, namely the\n            municipalities. Other lessons learned are: (i) coordination\n            between local partners is essential to implement\n            institutional reforms in the urban sector; (ii) the\n            Government must develop cooperation with and among donors,\n            especially for the decentralization of urban services and\n            infrastructure; (iii) continuity of projects must be ensured\n            to secure sector reforms; (iv) overly complex operational\n            arrangements, involving several implementing agencies, and\n            potential conflicts in jurisdiction, should be avoided; and\n            (v) simple disbursement procedures should be adopted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso -

      outlined in the Policy Framework Paper for 1991-93 and\n            focuses on implementation in two key areas: public resource\n            management and private sector incentives. The private sector\n            incentives component addresses public enterprise sector\n            restructuring, banking sector restructuring, and trade and\n            regulatory reform. The public sector resource management\n            component includes restructuring recurrent budget\n            expenditure to support human resource development,\n            preparation of a civil service management reform, and\n            improved investment programming. Specific actions include\n            elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports,\n            simplification of import procedures, price liberalization,\n            reform of the legal and regulatory framework for both the\n            public and private enterprise sectors, reduction in labor\n            market regulations, reduction in the relative size of the\n            wage bill in the government budget, increased budget\n            allocations for expenditure on health, education and routine\n            road maintenance, and strengthening budgetary control and\n
