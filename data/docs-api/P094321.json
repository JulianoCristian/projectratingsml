Some lessons\n            learned included: reducing political interference through\n            transparent and competitive staff selection procedures and\n            performance evaluations. Political instability and\n            interference, with the resulting staff changes, affected\n            project implementation. In anticipation of such challenges,\n            it is critical to include mitigation measures, to the extent\n            possible, during project preparation. In similar projects\n            supported by the World Bank in Latin America, transparent\n            and competitive staff selection procedures and performance\n            evaluations are included in the agreements for project\n            implementation. Measures that have proven highly successful\n            in ensuring staff continuity include the use of two\n            different external firms to take responsibility for: (i)\n            staff recruitment, which encourages unaffiliated\n            professionals to apply for project positions and widen the\n            candidate pool, and (ii) yearly performance evaluations\n            based on individual work plans and interviews with\n            beneficiaries. Although the project achieved its objective\n            in terms of reaching women, their active role in the Rural\n            Producer Organization (RPOs) remains low. Specific\n            strategies should be considered to foster women\u2019s\n            participation, such as establishing a specific business line\n            to support the types of businesses opportunities that\n            traditionally attract a high level of interest among women.\n            On the other hand, implementing dissemination events\n            specifically directed at women is a good practice in\n            demand-driven interventions such as Rural Economic\n            Development Program (PDER), as well as making targeted and\n            customized gender sensitive training available for RPOs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

The purpose\n            of this restructuring is to extend the closing date for the\n            project, by 12 months - from February 1, 2013 until January\n            31, 2014. The extension of closing date will be the third\n            second level project restructuring and the first extension\n            of closing date for this loan. Previous project\n            restructurings were approved on April 7, 2009 and June 30,\n            2011. Present disbursements amount to US$10,203,618.03 or\n            34.01 percent of the total loan amount of US$30 million. The\n            project's most recent progress towards achievement of\n            PDO is rated unsatisfactory and implementation progress is\n            moderately unsatisfactory. However, the project objectives\n            continue to be achievable. Of the two PDO indicators, the\n            one related to municipal projects stemming from the\n            participatory process planning has already surpassed and\n            doubled the target. The extension is necessary to allow the\n            project to implement 27 already approved business plans, and\n            seek the approval of more as feasible, enabling the project\n            to reach the other PDO indicator (increase of total sales of\n            the rural productive supply chain partnerships with US$50\n            million during the project period). The project had a\n            satisfactory audit report in 2011; the 2012 audit report\n            will be financed by the Inter-American Development Bank\n            (IADB) (a co-financier of the project). Financial\n            management, procurement performance, and the overall\n            safeguard compliance, continue to be moderately\n            satisfactory. An action plan has been agreed with the client\n            and officially sent to the World Bank on August 20, 2012.\n            The action plan is formulated in 5 steps, the first being an\n            extension of the closing date of the loan for 12 months. The\n            remaining 4 steps of the action plan will be discussed in\n            detail with the client during a mission in November 2012 and\n            specific actions will be improving performance. This will\n            involve a project restructuring related to improving\n            implementing agency performance, reallocation of proceeds\n            and adjustments of intermediate indicator targets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Rural Economic\n            Development Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/11/17058404/guatemala-rural-economic-development-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"GT-Project To Support A Rural Economic\n            Development Program -- P094321","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"E-Business,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Competitiveness and Competition Policy,Housing & Human Habitats,Business in Development","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Guatemala","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20121211004322"},"theme":"Indigenous peoples,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Other Private Sector Development,Managing for development results","subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Telecommunications,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways,Information technology,General public administration sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Transportation,Information and communications,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plan, Bank supervision, business\n            plans, disbursements, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, Financial\n            management, financier, implementation period, implementing\n            agencies, implementing agency, LOAN, procurement, Project\n            Management, sales, supervision, supply chain, targets,\n            transfer of responsibility"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF055405-PHRD-GAUTEMALA: LOCAL\n            DEVELOPMENT AND RURAL GROWTH PROJECT,TF057250-JSDF: GUATEMALA - IMPROVING\n            ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND GOVERNANCE FOR,TF057254-JSDF: GUATEMALA - IMPROVING\n            ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND GOVERNANCE FO-,TF095881-Poverty and Social Impact\n            Assessment of Agricultural Policies as Supply","majtheme":"Public sector governance,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"73398"},"facets":{}}}
