Some indictors could\n            not be measured because of flaws in the placement of\n            monitoring stations. Other impacts could not be demonstrated\n            because of insufficient information in the baseline survey.\n            Formulation of global environment objectives should take\n            into

      But the project was designed largely as a pilot to lay the\n            foundation for a larger program to be scaled up in the\n            future; on farm investments were implemented on a

Some\n            lessons learned included: projects seeking methodological\n            change and requiring a strong, committed field presence need\n            careful upstream analysis of the institutional profile and\n            capacity of partners and co-executors.

To secure genuine\n            collaboration on IEM longer-term, mechanisms are needed to\n            create intersection and communication between the\n            Recipient/Borrower and the other co-financing programs or\n            institutions.

The project demonstrated that a conjunction of\n            mechanisms and events is needed to mobilize and motivate\n            small farmers to engage with/in biodiversity conservation\n
