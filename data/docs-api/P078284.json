Some lessons learned included: Emergency\n            project in post-conflict country. One of the lessons learned\n            during the implementation of this Project, and other\n            emergency projects- has been the importance of keeping the\n            Project design simple. This required focusing on critical\n            requirements such as infrastructure required for emergency\n            response. The choice of highway and airport infrastructure\n            appropriately reflected national priorities, and the Project\n            achieved most of what it set out to achieve. Another lesson\n            for this Project, which may apply to other projects in a\n            post-conflict country as well, is that security related\n            issues should be carefully scanned and addressed. Without\n            appropriate preparation, security issues can affect the\n            project implementation process, increase project cost, and\n            even jeopardize the achievement of the project's\n            development objective. Emphasis on implementation support:\n            like any other post-conflict country, the Afghan\n            government's institutional capacity has been quite\n            limited. Strong implementation support from the Bank's\n            team and timely identification and response to project\n            issues are another important lesson learned during\n            implementation. Long-term institutional reform, and capacity\n            building support: the Afghan government needs to strengthen\n            the weak institutional capacity of its agencies and\n            ministries, which require institutional and policy reforms.\n            To make this happen, political endorsements from the highest\n            levels of the political structure are needed. International\n            consultants are needed to provide training and support to\n            local staff in implementing capacity building measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Emergency

Rehabilitation Project identifies the\n            potential negative environmental impacts of\n            Kabul-Salang-Doshi and Pole-e Khomri-Kunduz Roads. The\n            impacts on land resources and land use may result in\n            unstable mountain slopes, avalanche, and falling rocks; as\n            well as land degradation and erosion due to improper\n            disposal of cut and borrow material. Roads built on mountain\n            slopes accumulate rainwater runoffs, causing potential\n            erosion problems. Irrigation channels within the road's\n            right of way may damage the pavements. There may be\n            groundwater and surface water pollution during construction\n            and maintenance. Spillage and leakage from motor vehicles\n            could have negative effects. Additional dust and noise\n            levels are expected during construction. To mitigate these\n            impacts, specific measures will be taken to reduce the\n            potential impacts of physical works, including devising\n            acceptable safety measures, designs to limit erosion\n            problems in flat plain zones and mountain roads, and\n            incorporating traffic safety designs and improved access\n            points for villagers living along the roads. In the civil\n            aviation component, clearance of landmines is the most\n            important safety issue facing the Kabul Airport."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Borrower ' s Project
