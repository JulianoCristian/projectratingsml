In addition, International\n            Development Association staff are not adequately trained to\n            identify the \"red flags\" which could indicate\n            project mismanagement nor are the task teams provided with\n            the time or resources to identify potential problems. 2)\n            Oversight accountability: The forensic audit noted weak\n            oversight by government, permitting far too much discretion\n            to project management. This calls for establishing an\n            effective control review process, presumably within the\n            Ministry of Finance, and linking project performance to the\n            performance criteria of responsible staff who should be at a\n            senior level. Of equal importance, project steering\n            committees must be established, empowered and given real\n            accountability for overseeing the proper execution of\n            projects. 3) Involvement of high-level officials: Related to\n            the accountability lesson, the project's example\n            demonstrates the need for oversight and discussion of\n            project results to be conducted at a high level, both on the\n            government and Bank side. Currently, Permanent Secretaries\n            of responsible ministries and senior Bank staff should do\n            regular reviews, not just of project results but of\n            administrative, procurement, and financial procedures. (4)\n            Participation and downward accountability and communication:\n            A well developed and resourced communication strategy should\n            be adopted to inform civil society of project objectives,\n            intended outputs, and progress in meetings these objectives\n            and outputs. In addition, the project should include\n            programs to actively seek the participation of civil society\n            organizations in designing and implementing the agreed\n            programs  Other lessons concerned streamlining the\n            procurement and financial/payment procedures, strengthening\n            financial and technical audits, staffing and mainstreaming\n            of activities, and institutional issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -
