Some lessons learned\n            included: geothermal development is a risky business, with\n            only about a 30 percent success rate. Given the risk adverse\n            nature of investors and of Bank management, a renewable\n            energy project with a certain portion of the grant\n            designated for geothermal development might have resulted in\n            a more robust pipeline of subprojects and have been more\n            successful in meeting the Global Environment Objective\n            (GEO). Given that pipeline development is critical to the\n            success of a regional program, it should be pursued as early\n            as possible during project preparation. Close cooperation\n            between regions on similar innovative geothermal development\n            programs resulted in synergy and efficiencies in terms of\n            knowledge and product innovation. Sector specific\n            region-wide programs like the GeoFund program, solely\n            supported by Global Environment Facility (GEF) resources,\n            tend to lack country unit
