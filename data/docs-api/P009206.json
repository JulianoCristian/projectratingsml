After a slow start, the technical\n            assistance commitments undertaken by the Borrowers in\n            respect of institutional strengthening under the Projects\n            were largely met, except for improvements in the management\n            information systems (MIS) components partly due to the\n            existence of obsolete computer systems. The three Projects\n            were successful, to some extent, in meeting their objectives\n            of providing foreign exchange resources to meet priority\n            objectives in the LDRs at a difficult time in the Yugoslav\n            economy. The Projects had limited success in the overall\n            institutional strengthening of the Borrowers. The single\n            most important lesson emerging from the three Projects is\n            that a sound macroeconomic framework is essential for the\n            success of such projects. The Bank was unable to have any\n            significant impact on the critical issues of enterprise and\n            bank ownership and governance, a situation which is now\n            being addressed under the Government's ongoing economic\n            reform program. Other important lessons from the Projects\n            include the need to ensure that adequate monitorable minimum\n            financial performance standards are explicitly covenanted in\n            the loan agreements to reinforce the position of the\n            financial intermediaries vis-a-vis outside influences.\n            Furthermore, while macro-level adjustment operations\n            substantially increase the Bank's leverage in getting\n            the Borrowers' acceptance for major conditionalities,\n            given the short-duration, quick-disbursing nature of such\n            operations, adequate supporting conditionalities need to be\n            built into the investment operations themselves to ensure\n            sustainability of the improvements. Finally, strong\n            prudential supervision through the Central Bank or other\n            appropriate means should be ensured, particularly when there\n            is reason to suspect that the financial intermediaries may\n            be more than usually vulnerable to outside influences."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia -

The\n            project also includes a technical assistance component of\n            $670,000 ($400,000 for KBP and $270,000 for IBT), for\n            preparation of above-mentioned studies, staff training, and\n            procurement of office equipment.

- Seventh Industrial Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Seventh Industrial Credit Project is\n            designed to assist labor intensive and export oriented\n            industries through the provision of foreign exchange.\n            Besides, the project involves preparation of studies to\n            identify and develop projects in labor intensive and export\n            oriented industries in order to help KBP and IBT increase\n            their future role in the promotion of such industries. The\n            aggregate direct employment creation is expected to be about\n            10,000 jobs. Other objectives of the project are to\n            contribute to the institution building of the borrowing\n            banks, and to encourage joint ventures and cofinancing. The\n            project also includes a technical assistance component of\n            $670,000 ($400,000 for KBP and $270,000 for IBT), for\n            preparation of above-mentioned studies, staff training, and\n            procurement of office equipment. The risks associated with\n            the loans relate to meeting the employment and export\n            targets by beneficiary enterprises. However, provisions\n            included under the loans and Yugoslavia's policies to\n            foster industrial exports should reduce the risk to within\n            acceptable limits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia -
