Some lessons\n            learned included: Institutional measures do not, in and of\n            themselves, ensure implementation of reform in keeping with\n            its objectives. The ambitious approach adopted in\n            determining objectives and the schedule is a double-edged\n            sword. The development of the human resources and expertise\n            required to create an environment of reform and to help new\n            institutions function in this environment must be addressed\n            when the project is designed and activities are outlined. A\n            comprehensive assessment is necessary to determine the\n            merits of applying reform models that have been developed\n            for liberalized economies, whose governance, judicial system\n            and, more generally, operations have been stabilized, to\n            transition economies that are functioning in a\n            'second-best' environment. Adaptability and change\n            are necessary in an evolving environment. Changes in overall\n            environment do impact on the reform models that country\n            clients are ready to implement. Paying proper attention to\n            these changes and anticipating their effect on country\n            clients should be a key part of Bank's work. More\n            specifically, there may be a need to review the reform\n            models applied to the hydrocarbon sector and assess whether\n            the Bank has a convincing reform model for the hydrocarbon\n            sector for countries with relatively large-scale reserves\n            and low exploration and production costs in a high price environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Energy and Mining Technical\n            Assistance Loan Project (EMTAL)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Energy and Mining\n
