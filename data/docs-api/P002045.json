infrastructure and related urban\n            services to low income households. Urban infrastructure\n            would be furnished to provide sites and services and to\n            upgrade low income residential areas in two towns of Bauchi\n            State. Sites would also be provided for small scale\n            enterprises so as to furnish employment. Low income families\n            would be given access to construction loans and supporting\n            social services would be provided in the project area. The\n            project would benefit 74,000 people with incomes below the\n            urban median for Bauchi State. The project also seeks to\n            strengthen the planning and project implementation\n            capabilities of key institutions so that the experience\n            gained from this pilot project may be applied to other parts\n            of the country. In this context, technical assistance would\n            be provided to the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN)\n            and to state and local authorities participating in the\n            project. In addition, the FMBN would finance from the loan,\n            studies for the preparation of urban development projects in\n            seven other states."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Urban Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/09/726591/nigeria-urban-development-project","projn":"NG-Urban Devt-Phase I -- P002045","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Urban Housing and Land Settlements,Municipal Financial Management,Urban Services to the Poor,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810191244251"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban housing","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            procedures,administrative costs,affiliate,assets,Balance\n            Sheets,capital base,capital\n            markets,capitalization,capitals,cities,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,construction,cost of\n            living,debt,decentralization,deficits,Economic\n            Development,Employment,financial institutions,Financial\n            Ratios,FISCAL YEAR,Funds Flow,Housing,housing finance,Income\n            Distribution,infrastructure services,interest rates,Land\n            Use,liquidity,Local Government,migration,Natural\n            Resources,neighborhood,neighborhoods,new\n            towns,pollution,private housing,productivity,public\n            expenditures,public housing,public investment,rental\n            housing,Roads,Sanitation,savings,schools,sewage,slum\n            areas,Social Services,Technical Assistance,Towns,Urban,urban\n            centers,Urban Development,urban employment,Urban\n            Growth,urban infrastructure,urban lending,urban\n            planners,urban poor,urban population,Urban Poverty,urban\n            problems,Urban Projects,urban roads,urban sector,Urban\n            Services,urban water,urban water\n            supply,Urbanization,wages,waste,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            procedures,administrative costs,affiliate,assets,Balance\n            Sheets,capital base,capital\n            markets,capitalization,capitals,cities,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,construction,cost of\n            living,debt,decentralization,deficits,Economic\n            Development,Employment,financial institutions,Financial\n            Ratios,FISCAL YEAR,Funds Flow,Housing,housing finance,Income\n            Distribution,infrastructure services,interest rates,Land\n            Use,liquidity,Local Government,migration,Natural\n            Resources,neighborhood,neighborhoods,new\n            towns,pollution,private housing,productivity,public\n            expenditures,public housing,public investment,rental\n            housing,Roads,Sanitation,savings,schools,sewage,slum\n            areas,Social Services,Technical Assistance,Towns,Urban,urban\n            centers,Urban Development,urban employment,Urban\n            Growth,urban infrastructure,urban lending,urban\n            planners,urban poor,urban population,Urban Poverty,urban\n            problems,Urban Projects,urban roads,urban sector,Urban\n            Services,urban water,urban water\n            supply,Urbanization,wages,waste,water supply"}},"owner":"WB Off: Abuja - Western AFR 2 (AFCW2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"2412"},"facets":{}}}
