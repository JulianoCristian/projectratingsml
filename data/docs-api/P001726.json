The education adjustment component aimed to\n            establish the global policy, financial and institutional\n            framework for: (i ) expanding primary education access and\n            equity; (ii) improving quality and relevance at all levels\n            of the education system; and iii) increasing allocative\n            efficiency of education resources, in favor or primary\n            education. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned from this project were as follows: (i)\n            rather than attempting adjustment and investment\n            simultaneously, a sequential approach may be more effective;\n            (ii) adequate financing is important to make the short-term\n            benefits of reform greater than the costs; (iii) given the\n            sensitive political nature of education sector reforms, a\n            limiited number of strategic reform measures should be\n            defined and phased in over time rather than introducing\n            numerous controversial measures at one time; (iv) in\n            situations of budgetary austerity it is difficult, if not\n            impossible to develop primary education access and quality\n            without effective controls on student flows to public\n            secondary and higher education, especially in countries with\n            low primary education enrollment ratios; and (v) new\n            solutions should be explored which increasingly involve\n            communities in school management and financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Education Sector Consolidation
