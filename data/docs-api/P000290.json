It is imperative for such a\n            project to help beneficiaries put together the necessary\n            information that will guarantee equal access to\n            project-related benefits. 3) It is important to incorporate\n            the financial dimension into the natural resource management\n            approach, especially for those activities that generate\n            revenue, and to strengthen the capabilities of target\n            communities in their respect in order to create conditions\n            conducive to the long-term sustainability of project\n            investments. 4) Project activities must be planned in\n            realistic way. Many of the delays affecting first-phase\n            activities were traceable to cumbersome procedures. It is\n            necessary to institute multi-year planning and start the\n            preparation of bidding and pre-qualification documentation\n            well before the effectiveness date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -
