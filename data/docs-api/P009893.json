The main objective of the\n            original and restructured project was to substantially raise\n            agricultural production and farmers' incomes by\n            improving the use of the poorly drained black cotton soils\n            and the available water in the reservoirs of the\n            subprojects. The performance of the Bank in appraising the\n            project was deficient.   The Borrower performed well in the\n            preparation, including designs, tendering, procurement, and,\n            with the improvement in project management, the\n            restructuring was approved by the Bank. The lessons learned\n            from the project are classified as follows: (a) unless the\n            adequacy of water supply and the proper management of the\n            existing systems is ensured, expansion of irrigation\n            facilities to new areas in the culturable command area (CCA)\n            of the subprojects should not be taken up; (b) no new\n            projects should be considered for financing unless an\n            effective and sustainable Operation and Maintenance  system\n            covering both the construction and operational periods is\n            agreed upon and implemented; (c) The effectiveness of Water\n            Users' Associations should be judged not only in terms\n            of financial and water management, but also in terms of\n            their ability to maintain the structures turned-over to\n            them; (d) Bank should ensure that, in all new projects\n            providing irrigation facilities to traditionally rainfed\n            areas, an agricultural component with a separate budget is\n            included in the project from the outset (e) an Economic\n            Rehabilitation of Project component must be backed by a\n            detailed action plan prior to project implementation; and\n            (f) the review of technical aspects are as important as the\n            other social, economic, and financial aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Maharashtra Composite Irrigation III Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Maharashtra Composite\n            Irrigation III Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731903/india-maharashtra-composite-irrigation-iii-project","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural practices,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,allocation of water,availability of\n            water,available water,available water\n            resources,basins,canals,catchment\n            area,channel,channels,conjunctive use,construction,cost\n            recovery,crops,development projects,distribution\n            systems,drought,economics,efficient use of\n            water,environmental impact,environmental impact\n            assessment,environmental management,environmental\n            sustainability,equipment,farmers,farms,feasibility\n            studies,feed,groundwater,groundwater development,high\n            water,incomes,Irrigation,irrigation agriculture,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,maintenance activities,maintenance\n            costs,management of water,marketing,NGOs,private\n            sector,programs,project management,Public\n            Works,rainfall,reservoirs,river basin,scarce water,scarce\n            water resources,scarcity of water,soils,surface\n            drainage,universities,water allocation,Water\n            allocations,water availability,water charges,water\n            distribution,water management,water policy,water\n            resources,water resources management,water rights,water\n            shortage,water shortages,water supply,water user,water users"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural practices,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,allocation of water,availability of\n            water,available water,available water\n            resources,basins,canals,catchment\n            area,channel,channels,conjunctive use,construction,cost\n            recovery,crops,development projects,distribution\n            systems,drought,economics,efficient use of\n            water,environmental impact,environmental impact\n            assessment,environmental management,environmental\n            sustainability,equipment,farmers,farms,feasibility\n            studies,feed,groundwater,groundwater development,high\n            water,incomes,Irrigation,irrigation agriculture,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,maintenance activities,maintenance\n            costs,management of water,marketing,NGOs,private\n            sector,programs,project management,Public\n            Works,rainfall,reservoirs,river basin,scarce water,scarce\n            water resources,scarcity of water,soils,surface\n            drainage,universities,water allocation,Water\n            allocations,water availability,water charges,water\n            distribution,water management,water policy,water\n            resources,water resources management,water rights,water\n            shortage,water shortages,water supply,water user,water users"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management","projn":"IN-Maharashtra Irrig.

(200,000\n            ha) and Majalgaon (100,000 ha). The main components for\n            Jayakwadi will be: (i) completion of irrigation systems on\n            about 45,500 ha; (ii) completion of main drains, link\n            drains, and rural roads on about 153,000 ha; (iii)\n            construction of field channels, drains, and structures on\n            about 68,000 ha and field-channel protection on about\n            102,000 ha; (iv) landshaping of about 128,000 ha; (v)\n            development of three Specially Developed Distributories on\n            about 7,300 ha; and (vi) technical support to farmers. For\n            Majalgaon, the project will include; (i) constructing 116\n            canal regulation structures; (ii) construction of Majalgaon\n            main canal from km 67 to km 100; (iii) construction of the\n            distribution system up to the 1-cusec outlet in an area of\n            about 57,000 ha; (iv) construction of main and secondary\n            drainage and road networks on about 24,000 ha; (v) on-farm\n            developments and landshaping of about 24,000 ha; (vi)\n            development of a Majalgaon SDD on 4,000 ha; and (vii)\n            technical support to farmers. The project will increase\n            agricultural production and farmers' income in the two\n            commands. The project provides for landshaping and for\n            system operation methods which will ensure that all farmers\n            will obtain a reliable water supply."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Maharashtra Composite\n            Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Third Maharashtra\n            Composite Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/06/741376/india-third-maharashtra-composite-irrigation-project","projn":"IN-Maharashtra Irrig.
