Bank performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory because a firmer line should have been taken\n            on administrative restructuring. Borrower performance is\n            rated unsatisfactory because of substantial delays during\n            implementation. OED rates the outcome of the Agricultural\n            Sector Investment Project as moderately satisfactory and\n            sustainability is likely. Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory, reflecting the solid analytic underpinnings of\n            the project and the generally adequate nature of\n            supervision. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory,\n            primarily because of the high commitment to the project. OED\n            rates the outcome of the Northwest Mountainous Area\n            Development Project as satisfactory and sustainability is\n            rated likely because the participatory approach has built\n            community ownership. The National Rural Finance\n            Project's outcome is rated highly unsatisfactory\n            because it failed to improve on the deficient approach and\n            mixed performance of the projects that preceded it.\n            Sustainability is rated unlikely based primarily on the weak\n            loan recovery rate. Bank performance is rated highly\n            unsatisfactory because of the design deficiencies (reflected\n            in hurried preparation). Borrower performance is also rated\n            highly unsatisfactory, reflecting on the government's\n            failure to allow the National Agriculture Bank to function\n            as a solvent commercial enterprise. Four important lessons\n            were confirmed by this project experience: First, a\n            piecemeal approach to reform-trying to effect small changes\n            under the cover of a number of investment operations-offers\n            little leverage and is therefore unlikely to work. Second,\n            attempts to strengthen monitoring are futile if the\n            performance indicators monitored are not linked to achieving\n            significant outcomes. Third, decentralization is an\n            important objective, but may be counterproductive if\n            resources are spread too thinly. This is a particularly\n            important issue for agricultural services, the structure of\n            which needs to be rationalized. Fourth, where there have\n            been several interventions which are cumulative in effect it\n            is reasonable for evaluators to have higher expectations of\n            development effectiveness and to be correspondingly more\n            demanding in their search for evidence of effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Agricultural Research and\n            Extension

This requires a high\n            degree of coordination. 3) The Borrower's financial and\n            procurement procedures need to be simplified. 4) The\n            Government emphasized the priority that they gave to having\n            the ASIL already in place at the beginning of their 1994\n            budget year and the Bank was responsive in accelerating the\n            processing timetable to accommodate this demand. However,\n            this complex multi-component project would have benefited\n            from more preparation time, taking into account the large\n            number of sub-projects and the time consuming nature of the\n            procurement and contracting procedures. 5) The follow up\n            project and the initiation of detailed preparation studies\n            on other key sub-sectors resulted in new operations that\n            deepened and strengthened the reforms initiated through this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -

Sub-sectors include:  (a)\n            irrigation and water-use efficiency - efficient operation of\n            new and existing infrastructure is critical as Tunisia moves\n            towards full mobilization of available water resources.  The\n            Agriculture Sector Investment Loan (ASIL) will finance small\n            scale dams, irrigation perimeters associated with either\n            such dams or tubewells, modernization of existing\n            perimeters, groundwater surveying and monitoring, and rural\n            potable water.  Needed policy actions are additional\n            increases in water charges, application of a binomial\n            tariff, and promotion of water user associations; (ii)\n            natural resource management - the ASIL will support soil\n            erosion control, port infrastructure to encourage fishing\n            along the high potential northern coast and to permit\n            meeting the European Economic Community import quality\n            standards, and agro-pastoral improvement of rangeland.\n            Policy elements include implementation of the revised Soil\n            Code, replacement of force account implementation of soil\n            conservation works by contracts with farmers and private\n            enterprises, and a review of existing subsidies intended to\n            encourage fishing in the north; (iii) animal health and\n            production - the ASIL will support the animal disease\n            surveillance network through obligatory national vaccination\n            campaigns and development of disease laboratories, and\n            promote quality standards by financing equipment for\n            programs aimed at genetic improvement and milk quality\n            monitoring.  Policy reforms include phased privatization of\n            veterinarian services, and increased cost recovery for\n            vaccinations, laboratory services and artificial\n            insemination; and (iv) land consolidation - parcel\n            fragmentation constrains rainfed area development by\n            limiting the economic viability of farm units and farmer\n            access to credit and by exacerbating soil erosion.  The ASIL\n            will support development of a pilot intervention based on\n            voluntary consolidation of fragmented parcels in several\n            locations, capacity strengthening of the agency to be\n            responsible for the pilot program, and rural infrastructure\n            in the pilot areas.  Policy reforms consist of expanding the\n            legal basis for government interventions in rainfed areas.\n            Finally, to achieve greater efficiency of public investment,\n            the government's planning and implementation capacity\n            would be strengthened."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Agricultural Sector Investment\n            Loan (ASIL)
