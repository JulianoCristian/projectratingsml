Overall Bank performance and Borrower\n            performance are rated satisfactory. There were several\n            lessons learned: The promotion of new models of development\n            needs to be accompanied by careful design of te\n            implementation processes, particularly regarding methods of\n            financing and cost recovery. Several of the project's\n            investment components, while technically designed, failed\n            because of incomplete financing plans. In countries know n\n            for slow implementation and compliance of undertakings,\n            up-front completion of key actions before effectiveness\n            would improve quality at entry by reducing uncertainties. In\n            this case, the required Ministerial decrees and counter\n            guarantees should have been required before efectiveness.\n            The degree of flexibility required in a project must be\n            carefully considered and not exceed the limits imposed by\n            Bank and Government requirements and regulations.\n            Specifically-with regard to extension of the grace period\n            and debt rescheduling, the nature of the project and the\n            extraneous risks involved called for a more flexible\n            approach. When there are significant changs to a\n            project's components, project objectives should be\n            formally revised. Promoting environmental awareness can have\n            far-reaching beneficial impacts on investors and operators\n            in the sector-- especially when the clientele themselves\n            (tourists) are highly conscious of environmental issues.\n            Environmental state-of-the-art infrastructure can become a\n            tourist attraction in its own right. Tourism has proven to\n            be an effective sector for creating employment\n            opportunities, generating income, alleviating poverty, and\n            generating foreign exchange earnings. If the Bank were to\n            follow-up with another project in the sector, a key lesson\n            learned would be to focus more on sectoral analysis and\n            systematic policy and institutional issues (where\n            improvements would help upgrade the sector as a whole), and\n            on accompanying infrastructure and environmental investments\n            that would promote sound tourism development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Private Sector Tourism\n            Infrastructure and Environmental Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt -
