Several lessons are drawn\n            specifically from the project as follows. Creating an\n            enabling environment, with responsive institutions to\n            interface with the private sector is not only important, but\n            it enabled significant contributions to the country in terms\n            of mining exploration, and development. Moreover, the\n            integrated approach to sector reform, outlines the\n            applicability of the project and its components, as to the\n            development of mining rights, and environmental management\n            capacity, including the success of a well-defined\n            coordination between the federal, and provincial\n            implementing units, which established strong leadership, and\n            active participation at the provincial level, providing a\n            decisive stability factor. It is important to note the\n            usefulness of the geodetic, and environmental data\n            infrastructure, particularly for infrastructure, e.g. roads\n            construction, national hazards mitigation measures, and land\n            use planning. Nonetheless, sustainability of some of the\n            project's institutional achievement might be\n            jeopardized by the adverse macroeconomic situation of the\n            country. However, core administrative functions are, as a\n            rule, sustainable after closure of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Second Mining Development\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina -

Mining Development Technical Assistance Project\n            (PASMA II), expanding PASMA I by developing and implementing\n            an institutional framework for environmental management of\n            the mining sector applicable to the entire country. The\n            mining of metallic minerals generates solid waste, some of\n            it hazardous, and problems with water, soil, and air\n            contamination; and it poses risks for flora and fauna and\n            for people's health and safety. In arid and semiarid\n            zones where water is already scarce and access to\n            underground water is expensive, the water supply is further\n            taxed. Where most of the mining areas are located upriver\n            from the agricultural areas, surface and underground waters\n            are affected. Effective waste disposal is important to\n            prevent tons of residue waste from drying up and being\n            widely dispersed by frequent, strong winds. Non-metal mining\n            may produce air pollution, excessive noise, and vibrations\n            when this activity is located near population centers.\n            Abandoned caves from excavations can become flooded and in\n            summertime be used as makeshift spas/\"seaside\n            resorts,\" which has led to human fatalities. Untreated\n            byproducts from carbon processing muddy rivers. The report\n            identifies the need to build public services infrastructure\n            including health and recreational facilities to mitigate\n            impacts on indigenous populations and other socially\n            vulnerable groups.
