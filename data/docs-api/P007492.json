Furthermore,\n            from an overall marketing/ sales point of view, the price\n            subsidy was an asset. 3) an adequate tariff policy should be\n            in place, providing in turn, incentives to low income\n            consumers; and, 4) decentralization of Implementing Units\n            was paramount in achieving sales and distribution goals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - High Efficiency Lighting Pilot\n            Trust Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - High Efficiency Lighting\n            Pilot Trust Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/12/728052/mexico-high-efficiency-lighting-pilot-trust-fund-project","projn":"MX-High Eff.

The objectives of\n            the project are to: a) demonstrate the technical and\n            financial feasibility of reducing emissions of green house\n            gases and simultaneously reduce local environmental\n            contamination through the widespread installation of high\n            efficiency lighting; b) build the institutional capacity for\n            technological change and energy conservation; c) provide a\n            replicable model for demand-side management (DSM) in Mexico\n            and elsewhere in the developing world; and d) strengthen the\n            Federal Electricity Commission's capacity to practice\n            DSM on a sustainable basis. The project will replace\n            approximately 1.7 million incandescent bulbs with\n            fluorescent light bulbs (FLs) in the cities of Guadalajara\n            and Monterrey. The project includes: 1) the acquisition of\n            FLs; 2) the purchase of vehicles, metering equipment,\n            personal computers, office equipment and sales stands; 3)\n            consultant services for canvassing, marketing, testing,\n            auditing and project evaluation; 4) the cost of engineering,\n            monitoring and evaluation, billing and accounting; and 5)\n            the direct costs of implementing the project. The project\n            will result in substantial economic benefits including: 1) a\n            comparable or higher lighting level at reduced cost; and 2)\n            annual energy savings and postponement of costly investment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - High Efficiency Lighting Pilot\n            Ilumex Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - High Efficiency Lighting\n            Pilot Ilumex Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/03/734397/mexico-high-efficiency-lighting-pilot-ilumex-project","projn":"MX-High Eff.
