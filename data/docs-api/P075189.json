Much is changing in\n            the small towns and villages of Serbia. From Babusnica, in\n            impoverished southeast Serbia, to Citluk in the\n            Republic's central region, to Djurdjevo in the\n            developed northern province of Vojvodina, an innovative\n            education  program is changing the lives of students and\n            teachers in some 200 schools. And, with more residents\n            eagerly getting involved, the program is rapidly turning\n            into a movement. The School Improvement Program, Started in\n            2002, aims to improve teaching and learning in village\n            schools, as well as empowering communities to take\n            responsibility for their schools. Funds are only made\n            available once plans have been drawn up for school\n            development by the local education authorities, after\n            consulting with local people."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bringing computer literacy and innovative\n            teaching to Serbia"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bringing computer literacy and\n            innovative teaching to Serbia"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/06/25177000/bringing-computer-literacy-innovative-teaching-serbia","topic":"Education and ICT m1327028 494,Education for All m1327049 1467,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,Education m1327048 470,ICT Training of Education Providers\n            m1326328 1537","projn":"YF-Education Improvement Project (Serbia) -- P075189","subtopic":"Disability,Education For All,Primary Education,Effective Schools and Teachers,Tertiary Education","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Social Protections and Labor,Education","count":"Serbia","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08315d4fc_1_0"},"theme":"Decentralization,Participation and civic engagement,Social analysis and monitoring,Education for all","colti":"Results Profile","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Protections and Labor,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Education and ICT m1327028 494,Education for All m1327049 1467,Education Management and Administration\n            m1327507 1497,Education m1327048 470,ICT Training of Education Providers\n            m1326328 1537","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"study, access, education, information\n            technology, student, students, learning, teaching, training,\n            school development, teacher, children, school, school\n            improvement, teachers, workshops, hearing, rural schools,\n            secondary school, rural areas, computer literacy, knowledge,\n            grants, education authorities, school project, private\n            enterprises, homework, school improvement program, secondary\n            schools, investment, its, education improvement, elementary\n            schools, curriculum, newspapers, community, computer\n            training, literacy, elementary school, schools, innovative\n            teaching, professors, classrooms, innovative education,\n            movement, ministry of education, communities"}},"owner":"EDU GP ECA (GED03)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF038621-YUGOSLAVIA:  EDUCATION\n            DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT","majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"96068"},"9349534":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/01/9349534/yugoslavia-federal-republic-serbiamontenegro-education-improvement-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/01/9349534/yugoslavia-federal-republic-serbiamontenegro-education-improvement-project","new_url":"2008/01/9349534/yugoslavia-federal-republic-serbiamontenegro-education-improvement-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/04/11/000333037_20080411013107/Rendered/INDEX/ICR1740ICR0P0751890Box327353B01public1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/04/11/000333037_20080411013107/Rendered/PDF/ICR1740ICR0P0751890Box327353B01public1.pdf","credit_no":"3636","datestored":"2008-04-11T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2008-01-28T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia, Federal Republic of\n            Serbia/Montenegro - Education Improvement Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Education Improvement\n            Project for Republic of Serbia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: building institutional capacity in\n            using student assessment data and education information\n            systems takes time, especially if limited data are available\n            at the outset and information systems have to be built from\n            scratch. In five years, a country can reasonably be expected\n            to start collecting such data but getting education planners\n            at all levels to start using the data usually takes longer.\n            Future projects should set more realistic objective (e.g. if\n            starting from a low base have as an objective to collect\n            data but not built capacity) within a given timeframe.\n            Moreover, rather than wait for perfect Education Management\n            Information System (EMIS) to emerge, countries need to work\n            with existing data systems and

Improvement Project is to build\n            capacity and produce systemic information to help government\n            promote effective education reform. There are four project\n            components. The first component provides school improvement\n            grants to 650 basic schools and 50 general secondary schools\n            to support training, technical assistance, and outreach and\n            evaluation costs. The second component sets internationally\n            recognized standards, establishes a modern and\n            internationally recognized system for assessment and\n            examinations, and establishes and develops a sustainable\n            Education and Assessment Service for Serbia (ESAS).\n            Specifically, the component finances training and study\n            visits for key specialist and administrative/logistical ESAS\n            staff; equipment, software, materials, and books; develops\n            and field-tests standards-linked external assessment\n            instruments; and covers national costs, technical\n            assistance, and recurrent costs. The third component\n            promotes effective management of educational resources and\n            monitoring of performance by improving the educational\n            information and financing systems. The fourth component\n            funds educational decentralization; it strengthens\n            governance and management capacity in primary and secondary schools."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia,
