The Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. The risk\n            to development outcome was substantial. Significant changes\n            included extension of closing date and a shift in focus from\n            a crisis response operation to also provide technical\n            assistance for critical support for energy sector reform.\n            Several lessons were learned. It is important to set up\n            functioning implementation arrangements before project\n            effectiveness so that implementation is not delayed\n            unnecessarily. Further, better coordination between the\n            Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy and Industry\n            would avoid unnecessary delays and ensure smoother project\n            implementation.  For an emergency project it is imperative\n            to ensure that the project implementation unit (PIU) has\n            qualified and competent staff who are familiar with the\n            Bank's procedures, especially on procurement and\n            financial management.  It will be useful that the\n            operational manuals are developed and shared with PIU's\n            and all implementing entities to get staff familiarized with\n            project management and other procedures so that even if\n            there is a high staff turnover, the transition would be\n            smooth and project implementation would not be adversely\n            affected. In order to avoid delayed submission of audit\n            reports and breach financial covenants, it is essential to\n            select the auditors in time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic -

The Project was approved on\n            September 30, 2010 in order to mitigate the impact of the\n            April and June 2010 violence upon public finances and access\n            to energy. The changes under the current restructuring\n            include: (i) addition of a new results indicator to monitor\n            the technical assistance; (ii) addition of technical\n            assistance to the scope of Component 2; (iii) reallocation\n            of project funds in the amount of US $1.068 million from\n            component one (retroactively financed gas purchases) to\n            component two (rehabilitation and repair of energy\n            infrastructure and networks), and (iv) extension of the\n            project closing date by twelve months to December 31, 2013.\n            These changes will allow completion of ongoing procurements\n            and delivery of critical items of equipment in the amount of\n            US $10.1 million under component two, utilization of\n            approximately US $5.0 million in uncommitted funds, and the\n            provision of critical technical assistance for energy sector\n            reform and the Central Asia-South Asia electricity\n            transmission project (CASA-1000)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Emergency\n            Recovery Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/12/17073657/kyrgyz-republic-emergency-recovery-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"KG-Emergency Recovery Project-1114109 -- P123044","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business,Energy Production and Transportation","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Kyrgyz Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20121214004619"},"theme":"City-wide Infrastructure and Service Delivery,Social risk mitigation,Macroeconomic management,Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction","subsc":"General energy sector,Oil and gas,General transportation sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to energy, advisory services,\n            arrears, availability, circuit breakers, cities, computers,\n            electricity, Energy Infrastructure, energy sector, energy\n            services, equipment, Exchange Rate, expenditures, financial\n            sustainability, fuel, gas, Heat, heat output, heat supply,\n            heating, households, Networks, outreach, Power, Power Plant,\n            power shortages, power supply, procurement, procurements,\n            public finances, result, RESULTS, savings, targets,\n            Technical Assistance, transmission"}},"owner":"Macroeconomics 1 (ECSP1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Social protection and risk management,Economic management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"74374"},"facets":{}}}
