The objectives of the Project, as stated in the\n            Development Credit Agreement, were (i) strengthening and\n            expansion of Gambia's national health program; (ii) the\n            decentralization of health sector management; (iii) the\n            improvement of health sector planning; and (iv) the\n            introduction of a more effective cost recovery system. The\n            Bank's overall performance was satisfactory. Project\n            identification was consistent with The Gambia's health\n            policy and the economic recovery program.
