Donor coordination is important not only with\n            respect to damage and needs assessment but also in the\n            transition from the relief to the recovery phase of a\n            disaster. The Bank would be well advised if it involved\n            local specialists in the identification and design o f flood\n            reconstruction projects. Under the EFAP, a Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) was set up under the executive\n            office of the President of the Republic. While in many\n            disaster situations a direct link to the highest levels of\n            power is important, line agencies in Tajikistan may be\n            better equipped for project implementation, given their\n            technical know-how, to provide for medium and long-term\n            rehabilitation needs. A water strategy that integrates flood\n            management with the Tajikistan's irrigation and\n            hydropower needs could prevent future flooding rather than\n            providing only temporary relief."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan -

The project did not\n            focus on the issue of sustainability, given the nature of\n            the economic Recovery Credit. Overall, IDA performance is\n            rated satisfactory. Even taking into account the resource\n            constraints and circumstances prevailing in Tajikistan, the\n            overall performance of the Borrower must be rated\n            unsatisfactory. Projects such as this one have to be\n            designed with a great built-in flexibility in order to be\n            able to adequately address unforseeable needs as they evolve\n            from the reconstruction process. Such operations are\n            necessarily more resource intensive than traditional\n            operations and resource allocations for supervision should\n            be made accordingly on a case by case basis. Supervision\n            arrangements should also be tailored to the specific\n            circumstances of the project and provide for a substantially\n            larger involvement of Country Office staff in day-to-day\n            follow up and advisory support. the procurement arrangements\n            adopted for the project provide another example highlighting\n            the potential risks for conflict between IDA requirements\n            and the need for operational flexibility. While rational\n            from a policy point of view, the arrangements proved to be\n            too complex and cumbersome for the limited management\n            capacity of the project implementation unit (RPCU), and\n            rather than preventing mismanagement, opened the door to it.\n            IDA eventually agreed--too late--to revise the procurement arrangements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan -

The primary objectives are to 1)\n            support Tajikistan's government in its efforts to\n            mitigate the economic and social effects of the floods by\n            immediately repairing or rebuilding essential\n            infrastructure; 2) establish the conditions for a rapid and\n            effective resumption of economic exchanges and growth in the\n            rural areas affected; and 3) help reduce the risk of future\n            occurrence of similar damages. The project has two\n            components. Transport infrastructure provides for the repair\n            or reconstruction of about nine bridges and sections of\n            damaged roads in various regions of the country, including\n            the reconstruction of embankment protections (using\n            labor-intensive work methods) in the proximity of the works\n            implemented to prevent future damage from floods,\n            river-scouring or erosion. Other infrastructure provides for\n            the repair or reconstruction of infrastructure pertaining to\n            the sectors of agriculture (repair of flood protection dikes\n            and irrigation systems), power (repair of small rural\n            hydropower plants and transmission lines); and municipal\n            services (repair of water supply systems)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Emergency Flood Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tajikistan - Emergency Flood\n            Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/08/442097/tajikistan-emergency-flood-assistance-project","projn":"TJ-Emergency Flood Assistance Project -- P059055,TJ-Emergency Flood Assistance Project -\n            Supplemental Credit -- P068786","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Technical Annex","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Tajikistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980928162527"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Irrigation and drainage,Power,Water supply,Flood protection","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-3","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounting\n            procedures,Accounts,ADB,agricultural production,Annual\n            Report,audit reports,auditing,Audits,bank statements,Bank\n            supervision,budget estimates,budget transfers,budgetary\n            support,contractors,cost estimates,disasters,economic\n            development,Economic reform,economic\n            situation,education,employment,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental\n            Management,Expenditure,Expenditures,external\n            auditors,farms,Financial Management,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,health,impact\n            assessment,income,key performance indicators,labor\n            costs,local authorities,Management Reports,operating\n            costs,private sector,Procurement,property rights,quality\n            control,quality standards,Reporting,social services,State\n            enterprises,technical\n            assistance,timber,transport,victims,violence,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounting\n            procedures,Accounts,ADB,agricultural production,Annual\n            Report,audit reports,auditing,Audits,bank statements,Bank\n            supervision,budget estimates,budget transfers,budgetary\n            support,contractors,cost estimates,disasters,economic\n            development,Economic reform,economic\n            situation,education,employment,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental\n            Management,Expenditure,Expenditures,external\n            auditors,farms,Financial Management,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,health,impact\n            assessment,income,key performance indicators,labor\n            costs,local authorities,Management Reports,operating\n            costs,private sector,Procurement,property rights,quality\n            control,quality standards,Reporting,social services,State\n            enterprises,technical\n            assistance,timber,transport,victims,violence,water supply"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"4":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"trustfund":"TF037350-TAJIKISTAN - EMERGENCY FLOOD ASSISTANCE,TF037290-TAJIKSTAN - EMERGENCY FLOOD\n            ASSISTANCE PROJECT,TF036843-TAJIKISTAN - EMERGENCY FLOOD ASSISTANCE,TF036435-TAJIKISTAN - P-C RECONSTRUCTION\n            (POST CONFLICT),TF034640-ECA REGION - PILOT RECONSTRUCTION","repnb":"T7255"},"facets":{}}}
