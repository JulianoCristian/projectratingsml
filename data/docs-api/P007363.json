The main two project objectives were to: (i) meet\n            water service needs by increasing water production and\n            storage capacity and extend water and sewerage networks to\n            poor urban neighborhoods; and (ii) strengthen Municipal\n            Water Division of San Pedro Sula (DIMA) to make it an\n            autonomous and financially sustainable water utility. The\n            project was directed to National Autonomous Water and\n            Sewerage Service (SANAA), the national water company, with\n            the objective of improving its institutional, economic and\n            financial areas. Some lessons learned from this project are\n            the following: (a) political interference, frequent turnover\n            in higher management and recruitment constraints limit the\n            independent operations of institutions like DIMA. These\n            difficulties could be addressed through a long term\n            concession, or some other arrangement with the private\n            sector, which permits the agency to operate on a more\n            business-like basis (b) an automatic mechanism free from\n            political interference needs to be established to adjust\n            tariffs to inflation, meet cost-recovery levels and ensure\n            the financial sustainability of DIMA (c) a competent\n            coordinating unit is instrumental for project implementation\n            success, but it needs to be well integrated within the\n            entire institution to achieve financial sustainability (d)\n            Bank project preparation missions need to be more careful in\n            reviewing basic data and assumptions that determine project\n            size and scope."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Water Supply and Drainage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Water
