A second aim is to establish a center of\n            excellence in the region for distance learning and exchange\n            of information and experience. The project has two main\n            components. The first component consists of building\n            facilities on the site of the National School of\n            Administration (ENAM) to establish the Distance Learning\n            Center (DLC); to provide a video-conference room with a\n            30-person capacity, a computer room outfitted for 30\n            computer stations (hardware, software, and Internet\n            hook-up), a technical and administrative center, and\n            installation and/or upgrading of electrical and telephone\n            wiring. It also includes purchase and installation of a Very\n            Small Aperture terminal (VSAT) (satellite communication\n            terminal), video, telecommunications, and microprocessor\n            equipment, office and classroom furniture, and various other\n            equipment for DLC operation and security. The second\n            component helps the DLC become operational and financially\n            viable. It finances DLC costs on a decreasing basis over the\n            first three years of operation; purchases a vehicle; and\n            supplies technical assistance for training, periodic\n            evaluation of operation and management effectiveness, and\n            financial accounts and their annual audits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Distance Learning Project (LIL)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Distance Learning\n            Project (LIL)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/06/437093/senegal-distance-learning-project-lil","projn":"SN-Aftkl: Sn Distance Learning Center - Lil\n            -- P069198","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Business Environment,Teaching and Learning,Educational Sciences,Business in Development,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Education","count":"Senegal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00081406033021"},"subsc":"Telecommunications","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Account,Accounting,accounts,achievement,Audit\n            reports,Auditing,auditors,budgeting,business\n            plans,classrooms,Competitive Bidding,contractors,cost\n            accounting,Cost Effectiveness,cost\n            recovery,curricula,decision makers,depreciation,Distance\n            Learning,Educators,Exchange Rate,Expenditure,expenditure\n            categories,expenditures,financial\n            statements,innovations,learning activities,learning\n            centers,lectures,marketing,marketing\n            strategy,media,Participatory\n            approach,Procurement,programming,programs,recognition,reporting,social\n            development,technical\n            assistance,telecommunications,trainees,training\n            activities,training budgets,training centers,training\n            courses,vocational training"},"1":{"cdata!":"Account,Accounting,accounts,achievement,Audit\n            reports,Auditing,auditors,budgeting,business\n            plans,classrooms,Competitive Bidding,contractors,cost\n            accounting,Cost Effectiveness,cost\n            recovery,curricula,decision makers,depreciation,Distance\n            Learning,Educators,Exchange Rate,Expenditure,expenditure\n            categories,expenditures,financial\n            statements,innovations,learning activities,learning\n            centers,lectures,marketing,marketing\n            strategy,media,Participatory\n            approach,Procurement,programming,programs,recognition,reporting,social\n            development,technical\n            assistance,telecommunications,trainees,training\n            activities,training budgets,training centers,training\n            courses,vocational training"}},"owner":"AFRDE - Development Effective.
