Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) Building up a successful institution is\n            time-consuming and challenging and requires close Bank\n            supervision, especially during changes of Government\n            administration; 2) Closing an institution implies a thorough\n            review of all its assets; 3) Internet community centers\n            require a specific use; 4) Approval processes within an\n            institution must be designed bearing in mind that there is a\n            tradeoff between time and exhaustiveness; 5) A good Spectrum\n            Monitoring and Administration System (SMAS) requires more\n            than just the equipment; 6) Mobile networks are very active\n            and expand in a timely manner; 7) Cross-sector projects\n            require commitment and coordination from all involved\n            parties; and 8) It is better to have an independent\n            regulator. However, it must be said that, in the case of\n            Dominican Republic, this fact did not became an obstacle\n            that hindered the development of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic -

It will also improve rural access\n            to services through private sector investments. The four\n            main components will: 1) create new telecommunications\n            regulatory measures, drafting regulations for\n            interconnection agreements, licenses, resolution of\n            disputes, as well as radio frequency use and management,\n            and, different types of existing and new services. Tariffs\n            will be reviewed, in addition, design and administration of\n            the Fund for the Development of Telecommunications (FDT)\n            will be implemented; 2) create an autonomous\n            telecommunications regulatory entity, through the\n            appointment of executive management and staff, and define\n            organizational functions. Procurement of monitoring\n            equipment, and, office/computer equipment will be provided,\n            together with technical assistance; 3) transfer regulatory\n            functions to the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications\n            (INDOTEL) upon the closure of the Directorate General of\n            Telecommunications (DGT), and, severance compensation will\n            be funded; 4) finance and manage the project management unit\n            and INDOTEL, to include project audits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Telecommunications\n            Regulatory
