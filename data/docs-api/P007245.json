The major goals of the revised project\n            were to: (i) stabilize and restructure Linmine's (the\n            most important Guyanese bauxite operation) finances; (ii)\n            rehabilitate its operational capacity; and (iii) lay the\n            basis to privatize it, in order to recover the\n            company's sales potential. IDA performance was\n            generally good. The Borrower's apparent lack of\n            aggressiveness with respect to project supervision or in the\n            pursuit of an agreed privatization strategy, especially in\n            the period following the 1992 elections, added to the delays\n            in execution of the revised project. The major lessons\n            learned from the project were: (a) International Development\n            Association (IDA) and its borrowers need to be exceedingly\n            thorough in assessing whether the instruments and experience\n            available to IDA match the client's needs and are\n            adequate to manage the risks which may be encountered during\n            project implementation; (b) the use of a project with\n            intricately-woven conditionalities is not sufficiently\n            flexible for carrying out time-sensitive undertakings, as\n            required in the case of Linmine; (c) privatization projects\n            should not aim to rehabilitate, given that the investment\n            strategy of the potential investor is unknown and the\n            rehabilitation might tend to harden the negotiating stance\n            of the government; (d) the role of IDA and other public\n            financial institutions in such pragmatic deals remains an\n            open question; (e) IDA procurement guidelines may be too\n            complex and not appropriate to the process of selecting a\n            joint venture partner in delicate restructuring and\n            privatization processes; and (f) financial restructuring\n            should not try to involuntarily reschedule payments to\n            important suppliers of goods and services to an operating\n            company, as they are essential to its continued operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Bauxite Industry Technical\n            Assistance
