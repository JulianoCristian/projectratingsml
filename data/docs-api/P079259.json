Some lessons learned included: the\n            project confirmed that social fund activities can provide a\n            better quality of life for the poor, can be efficient\n            mechanisms for constructing small-scale infrastructure, can\n            build social capital, and have a visible, inclusive\n            development impact. Indeed, these operations can serve as\n            catalysts for a process in which citizens in targeted\n            communities, especially in mixed and minority communities,\n            gradually came together over time and participate in the\n            design, implementation and monitoring of projects which\n            respond to the common good of the community. An important\n            lesson of this project is that the sustainability of\n            community investments has significantly improved through the\n            financial management training which resulted in\n            municipalities preparing five-year financial plans which now\n            provide line items for maintenance expenditures of public\n            facilities. In addition, training in the areas of monitoring\n            and supervision of micro-projects is equally critical. A\n            critical aspect in this type of operation is the development\n            of a comprehensive framework for stakeholder involvement and\n            participation, in addition to strong institutional support\n            from the project team, effective systems and procedures.\n            Outreach and promotion, a community mapping and profiling\n            exercise, and needs assessments are important elements to\n            the success of this operation. Indeed, better communication\n            between project committees, municipality authorities and\n            beneficiaries also underline the importance of including an\n            awareness raising component in this type of operation. The\n            targeting of young people in this type of project, and\n            particularly give the sensitive political situation in\n            Kosovo, was of considerable importance because among\n            conflict-affected areas, youth risks are the highest due to\n            the combined conditions of conflict, poverty, and high\n            levels of youth

The people of\n            Podujev\u00eb were busy pulling their lives together from the\n            ravages of conflict and the complications of Kosovo\u2019s\n            uncertain reality. The most immediate problem was the stench\n            from the open-sewers and the diseases that brought with\n            them. So the towns people got together and drew up plans to\n            lay a sewage line along the main street. All villagers with\n            cash to spare contributed to the project. For each small\n            project, their partner was the Community Development Fund\n            (CDF). The fund was set up in 1999 by the World Bank. So far\n            it has provided grants to 320 projects all over Kosovo.\n            Village committees pass project ideas to the municipal\n            councils which must agree to provide their share before a\n            proposal is submitted to the CDF. The CDF staff manage the\n            finances of each project and train local civil servants to\n            improve their performance. Contractors like it too because\n            they are more likely to get paid in full and on time. A\n            major strength of the fund, which focuses on local\n            infrastructure, schools, and social services is the special\n            relationship it has fostered between citizens and municipal\n            authorities. Its success has attracted additional support\n            from several governments like Austrians, Canadians, Dutch,\n            and Swiss."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Building a new Kosovo - One village at a time"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Building a new Kosovo - One\n            village at a time"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/09/25074415/building-new-kosovo-one-village-time","topic":"Urban Development m1327371 699,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Hygiene Promotion m1326501 147,Water Supply m1326961 138,Fragility, Conflict and Violence m1326586 2432,Social Development m1327660 134","projn":"XK-Community Development Fund 2 Project -- P079259","subtopic":"Disability,Municipal Financial Management,Urban Governance and Management,Housing & Human Habitats,Population Policies","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Social Protections and Labor","count":"Kosovo","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0830f4d73_1_0"},"theme":"Municipal governance and institution building,Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction,Participation and civic engagement,Other social protection and risk management,Rural policies and institutions","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Health,General education sector,Other social services","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Social Protections and Labor","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Urban Development m1327371 699,Economic Growth m1326241 471,Hygiene Promotion m1326501 147,Water Supply m1326961 138,Fragility, Conflict and Violence m1326586 2432,Social Development m1327660 134","sectr":"Education,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"unemployment, communities, minority,\n            municipal authorities, community development, working-age\n            population, diseases, war, training, social services, local\n            infrastructure, self-help, schools, municipal councils,\n            international committee, population, services, inhabitants,\n            sewage, community, job, architect, governments, project,\n            projects, complications, school, municipal, contractors,\n            grants, citizens, minorities, infrastructure"}},"owner":"Social Protect &  Labor - GP (GSPDR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF054421-CIDA COFINANCING GRANT FOR\n            KOSOVO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND II PROJECT,TFS54421-CANADIAN COFINANCING OF THE\n            KOSOVO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND II PROJE-,TFM54421-CANADIAN COFINANCING OF THE\n            KOSOVO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FUND II PROJEC","majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Social protection and risk management,Urban development","repnb":"92512"},"23961969":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/01/23961969/helping-communities-rebuild-lives","available_in":"English","virt_coll":"Results Profile","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/01/23961969/helping-communities-rebuild-lives","new_url":"2006/01/23961969/helping-communities-rebuild-lives","disclosure_date":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/05/000470435_20150205094456/Rendered/INDEX/9249202006Jan20s0Box0385367B0PUBLIC.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/05/000470435_20150205094456/Rendered/PDF/9249202006Jan20s0Box0385367B0PUBLIC.pdf","credit_no":"H068","datestored":"2015-02-05T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2006-01-23T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Helping communities rebuild their lives"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"At the heart of the Balkans is Decan, a\n            rural municipality in western Kosovo on the Albanian border.\n            For centuries Decan\u0092s inhabitants lived off the land, with\n            almost three quarters of the workforce employed in\n            agriculture. The war, however, severely disrupted economic\n            activity. In the 1999 conflict, most of Decan\u0092s inhabitants\n            fled and almost three fifths of all houses were totally\n            destroyed. Most of the Agro- Kombinat, the collective\n            farming infrastructure, was severely damaged and a lot of\n            private farming equipment disappeared. Poverty increased and\n            unemployment, particularly among youth, rose dramatically.\n            Basic infrastructure was lacking.

This project has the following three\n            components: Component 1) will finance on a grant basis,\n            small-scale community works and services projects selected\n            on a demand-driven basis with the active participation of\n            community groups and local governments. The Community\n            Infrastructure Sub-component will address the need for\n            rehabilitation and construction of small-scale social and\n            economic infrastructure at the local level through the\n            financing of community investment micro-projects. The\n            Community Social Services Sub-component will support\n            community services programs targeted to address the needs of\n            vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in Kosovo with a view to\n            promote inter-community integration by actively engaging\n            citizens in the development process of their communities.\n            Component 2) will complement the community investment\n            component, enabling local level institutions and community\n            groups to address the needs and priorities for local\n            development through a comprehensive capacity building\n            program which would be consistent with current transference\n            of responsibilities under the Mandate to establish\n            substantial self-government. At the Micro-project level,\n            institutional strengthening will focus on local governments,\n            communities and contractors participating in community\n            infrastructure and services micro-projects. At the local\n            government level the project will focus on capacity building\n            needs in municipalities with the aim of enhancing the\n            understanding of municipal authorities of their potential\n            role in facilitating and supporting community-based\n            initiatives to address major priorities. Component 3) will\n            support the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) covering\n            operating costs such as acquisition of minor\n            additional/replacements of office furniture and equipment,\n            communications, local travel, utilities and publications,\n            office rent, office supplies, fuel, internet service, bank\n            commission charges, vehicle maintenance and repair, and\n            Community Development Fund (CDF) staff salaries.

To minimize soil erosion and\n            contamination due to construction, and/or medical waste\n            materials, regular control and cleaning of construction\n            sites should be enforced, including the provision of\n            adequate waste disposal services. Special attention should\n            be given to drainage systems, with a proper disposal of oil\n            and other hazardous materials, adequately disposed of,\n            according to sanitary, and standard waste disposal\n            regulations. Construction should be restricted to daytime\n            hours, to prevent noise disturbances, and in addition, prior\n            to construction, special attention should be given to site\n            selection, to mitigate loss of natural vegetation (to be\n            followed by re-vegetation practices), or sensitive species.\n            Protection of historical/cultural sites, call for the\n            immediate notification to the relevant authorities should\n            archaeological finds occur. Specifically designed methods\n            should be in place for the disposal of medical wastes.\n            Regarding irrigation schemes, extension and training in crop\n            selection, and agricultural technology should be provided,\n            to include as well adequate drainage systems, and control of\n            agrochemical uses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro
