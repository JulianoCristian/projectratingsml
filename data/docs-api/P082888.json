Public Sector Capacity\n            Building Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Public Sector Capacity\n            Building Project for Mauritania were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            analysis of public sector reform efforts in a politically\n            fragile context like Mauritania raises important lessons\n            about how to best design and implement effective projects\n            and how to effectively engage with the government in such a\n            context.  Government needs to be engaged and to assume a\n            high level of responsibility and ownership during project\n            design and implementation.  Changes in the project\n            management team can have significant and negative\n            consequences for project implementation.  Knowledge\n            management is essential for improving project monitoring and\n            ensuring appropriate coordination between project\n            stakeholders. As a way of laying groundwork to be able to\n            gather data and produce evidence-based results assessments,\n            it may be worth investing in ex-ante cost-benefit analysis\n            at the preparation stage of public sector capacity building\n            TA projects. It is advisable for the Bank to develop a sound\n            strategy when developing IFMIS systems that includes: (i)\n            identifying the Public Finance Management, or PFM reform\n            needs of the government and the country context conditions;\n            (ii) developing customized solutions with the possibility to\n            use of Rapid Results Approaches when possible; and (iii)\n            strengthening capacity for project implementation. The Bank\n            should also better clarify the link between PFM and service\n            delivery improvements, as well as publishing open budget\n            data, when developing the strategy to design and implement\n            Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Public Sector Capacity Building
