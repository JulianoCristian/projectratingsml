A key lesson from this project is\n            that investments in petroleum development need to adequately\n            account for the uncertainties of hydrocarbon reserves, and\n            possible variations in production levels. Wherever possible,\n            operator's reservoir estimates should be re-confirmed\n            through independent studies, and field-tested technology\n            should be adopted on future projects. It is also important\n            that the targets/schedules for field development provide\n            adequate time for completion of individual components. The\n            project experience also highlights the need for establishing\n            clear linkages between field development and investments in\n            down-stream facilities. Another major lesson is the lack of\n            familiarity with Bank procurement guidelines. Finally,\n            long-term institutional measures need to be taken by the\n            government for the development and facilitation of\n            construction industry, especially pipeline construction, so\n            that competent and qualified contracting firms are available\n            in the country to undertake similar projects in the future."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
