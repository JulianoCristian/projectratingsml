Some lessons\n            learned included: the experience of parts of the human\n            resources sub-component of the PDPL confirms the importance\n            of 'ownership' and 'criticality' as good\n            practice principles for development policy loan operations.\n            The lack of clear ownership by the authorities and the\n            assessment that the prior action is not critical to\n            achieving results might have contributed to the partial\n            achievement of some of the program objectives and could be\n            interpreted as suggesting that a more narrow focus will have\n            been more appropriate. At the same time, the experience of\n            the decentralization sub-component of the program suggests\n            that a broader focus could be supported provided the good\n            practice principles are met. This subcomponent was not\n            necessarily central to either pillar one or two, but its\n            inclusion in the PDPL helped avert a potential derailing of\n            this area of reform. The PDPL team tried to secure a buy-in\n            for the supported reforms from as many groups, particularly\n            the opposition, as possible. This approach paid off as the\n            change in government between PDPL two and three did not\n            result in backtracking on the reform program. Also, the new\n            law on labor balanced the interests of the parties through\n            stakeholder involvement, which made its passage faster. The\n            participatory process by which the law was prepared also\n            improved negotiating sills of relevant stakeholders, which\n            will be useful for negotiations in the future."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -\n            First, Second, and Third Programmatic Development Policy\n            Loans

Loans\n            (PDPLs) designed to support the Government's economic\n            reform program over a three to four year period. The program\n            aims to promote economic growth and job creation through: 1)\n            reforms to improve the investment climate, and 2) reforms to\n            strengthen the governance and efficiency of the public\n            sector. Improving the investment climate will depend on\n            judicial reform, labor market reform, improving the business\n            environment, and strengthening financial sector regulation\n            and supervision. Strengthening public sector governance will\n            depend on public administration reform, health sector\n            reform, and decentralization. The reform program would be\n            consistent with the Government's aspiration for\n            eventual EU membership. Capacity weakness could impede full\n            implementation of some proposed reforms.

This PDPL series follows up\n            on the reforms initiated under the recent Public Sector\n            Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL) and the Second Financial\n            and Enterprise
