Some lessons\n            learned included: to achieve a balance among types of small\n            grant activities, it is recommended that each type of\n            activity is funded through different windows.\n            Income-generating projects were in higher demand than\n            education and capacity-building projects; however, the need\n            for capacity-building remained at the end of the project. A\n            better balance might have been achieved through dedicated\n            funds for capacity building rather than having a single\n            window for education, capacity building, and income\n            generation projects. The Conservation and Rural\n            Revitalization Grants (CRRG) Program proactively encouraged\n            local people to prepare project applications and the Program\n            fostered entrepreneurial pursuits. Project proposals that\n            were not selected in the first round were given additional\n            support to improve on their ideas and proposals, with the\n            result that more than half were accepted in the second\n            round. All applications were retained in a database for\n            consideration in case additional funding became available.\n            Unfinanced project proposals from Primorsko-Goranska County\n            were retained and later included in the project pipeline for\n            the European Union (EU) regional operational programs. Such\n            lists and databases not only provide ideas for further\n            development but also incentives for more proactive local\n            rural

Croatia, the only\n            component with potential negative environmental impacts is\n            Component 2, which establishes community-based mechanisms\n            for biodiversity conservation and sustainable resources use,\n            and supports civil works to improve protected area\n            facilities and management. Mitigating measures are outlined\n            as follows: Dust from transporting and handling construction\n            works will be minimized by water and other means such as\n            enclosure of construction sites. To reduce noise,\n            construction will be restricted during certain hours. All\n            debris, construction, and wood waste will be stored within\n            the work site. Wood waste will be stored separately and\n            arranged for recycling. Open burning and illegal dumping\n            will not be permitted. Proper sites for earth/clay and sand\n            dispersal will be determined and prior approval from\n            relevant authority for disposal obtained. Stockpiling\n            construction debris on-site will be avoided and waste\n            disposed regularly at an authorized dumping ground. Debris\n            chutes will transfer debris efficiently from higher floors\n            to the ground floor to prevent nuisance. New campsites\n            selection will be based on a criteria that will minimize\n            impacts on fauna and flora. New trail design will consider a\n            set of criteria including slope, drainage, susceptibility to\n            soil erosion, and traffic management. Identifying suitable\n            sites and using garbage receptacles will prevent degradation\n            of site conditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Karst Ecosystem Conservation\n
