The project was designed to improve the water\n            supply and sanitation conditions in some of the poorest\n            rural communities of Indonesia. It was expected that\n            improved access to safe and reliable water supply and\n            sanitation facilities, along with the provision of hygiene\n            and sanitation education would result in improved health and\n            increased productivity of the community members. Community\n            participation was encouraged in all phases of the project,\n            from project design to implementation and maintenance.\n            Mechanisms such as meetings, community surveys, focus group\n            discussion, training, and capacity-building exercises\n            facilitated active community involvement. Information\n            sharing and dissemination was ensured through community\n            notices and updates on project rules, roles, and\n            responsibilities. Such data sharing also induced\n            transparency in the project's activities. WSSLIC was\n            completed in September 1999 and contributed substantially to\n            improve the water supply and sanitation facilities in rural\n            communities, although sanitation and hygiene education did\n            not result in any major behavioral changes. Some of the\n            other issues that remained partially unresolved were\n            administrative and fund channeling arrangements, mechanisms\n            to encourage the active participation of women, and the\n            delegation of community control over the water supply and\n            sanitation systems. The Second Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project (WSSLIC 2) began operation in 2000. The project\n            builds on the drawbacks and lessons learnt from WSSLIC and\n            other rural infrastructure development projects in Indonesia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Water supply and sanitation for\n            low income communities"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Water supply and\n            sanitation for low income communities"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2003/01/11311287/indonesia-water-supply-sanitation-low-income-communities","count":"Indonesia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to information, access to safe\n            drinking water, active community involvement, availability\n            of water, boiling water, Capacity Building, central\n            government, collection of water, community development,\n            community groups, community health, community involvement,\n            community leaders, community members, Community\n            participation, construction, construction activities, cost\n            recovery, decision making, districts, drainage, drainage\n            system, engineers, Environmental Sanitation, Gender,\n            households, hygiene, hygiene education, LOW INCOME\n            COMMUNITIES, Project Management, public participation,\n            Public Works, quantity of water, rainwater, rural\n            communities, rural development, rural sanitation, rural\n            water, Rural Water Supply, safe water, sanitation\n            activities, sanitation component, sanitation coverage,\n            sanitation education, sanitation facilities, sanitation\n            infrastructure, Sanitation Policy, sanitation services,\n            sanitation systems, screening, social science, toilets,\n            village level, villages, washing, water management, water\n            management system, water projects, water quality, water\n            resource, water resource management, water scarcity, water\n            source, water supplies, WATER SUPPLY, water system, water\n            systems, wells"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"ID-Indonesia - Wsslic I -- P003990","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Sanitation and Sewerage,Housing & Human Habitats,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","authors":{"authr":"Bhatnagar, Deepti; Dewan, Ankita; Torres,\n            Magui Moreno; Kanungo, Parameeta;"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20091105043240"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"General public administration sector,Water supply,Sanitation,Other social services,Health","theme":"Child health,Rural services and infrastructure,Pollution management and environmental health,Participation and civic engagement,Gender","colti":"Empowerment case studies","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"HNP Sector Unit (EASHH)","trustfund":"TF021659-SWISS GRANT TO WSP FOR E.

Lessons are addressed under three\n            categories: underlying theory and assumptions; project\n            design; and, project implementation. First, the reasoning\n            behind most water supply, and sanitation projects is that\n            water is a public good with impact on health, whereas\n            sanitation is considered a private good. Though not\n            explicit, this implies that while water supply should be\n            subsidized (or publicly intervened), sanitation remain a\n            personal decision matter, thus the project actively\n            challenged sanitary integration through the inclusion of a\n            hygiene and sanitation education component, stimulating a\n            household package for latrine construction. Second,\n            operations like this one, should use simple project design\n            schemes, relying on community participation, through proper\n            training, and technical support; but, accountability for\n            funds allocation, should be centrally channeled,\n            particularly if inter-governmental coordination is\n            politically, or technically weak. It is emphasized that\n            reliable, and timely data collection is required for a\n            continuous hands-on operation, and corrective changes,\n            avoiding comparable data which may be hindered by variable\n            methods. Third, project implementation should consider both\n            political, and logistic criteria; ensure monitoring and\n            evaluation; and, balance institutional arrangements between\n            limited cost overruns, and procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Water Supply and Sanitation for\n            Low Income Communities Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Water Supply and\n            Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/06/729115/indonesia-water-supply-sanitation-low-income-communities-project","projn":"ID-Indonesia - Wsslic I -- P003990","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Hygiene Promotion and Social Marketing,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Services to the Poor,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00092105321010"},"subsc":"Water supply,General public administration sector,Other social services,Health,Sanitation","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessible water supply,adequate\n            sanitation,bacteriological quality,behavior\n            change,behavioral change,breeding grounds,capacity\n            building,civil society,clean water,Community\n            Health,community participation,cost of water,decision\n            power,demand for water,disease incidence,distribution\n            systems,drainage system,environmental objectives,health and\n            hygiene,health education,household\n            connections,households,Hygiene,hygiene behavior,hygiene\n            education,hygiene practices,infant mortality,latrine\n            construction,latrine coverage,local governments,managing\n            water resources,Physical construction,Project\n            Management,public sanitation,Public Works,rural\n            communities,rural villages,Rural Water,Rural Water\n            Supply,Sanitation infrastructure,sanitation\n            services,Sanitation strategy,sanitation\n            systems,schools,sectoral policies,social marketing,solid\n            waste,solid waste management,stagnant water,urban\n            water,urban water supply,user fees,valuable\n            information,washing,washing hands,water availability,water\n            quality,water quantity,water resources,water scarcity,Water\n            Supply,water supply facilities,water systems,water\n            usage,water user"},"1":{"cdata!":"accessible water supply,adequate\n            sanitation,bacteriological quality,behavior\n            change,behavioral change,breeding grounds,capacity\n            building,civil society,clean water,Community\n            Health,community participation,cost of water,decision\n            power,demand for water,disease incidence,distribution\n            systems,drainage system,environmental objectives,health and\n            hygiene,health education,household\n            connections,households,Hygiene,hygiene behavior,hygiene\n            education,hygiene practices,infant mortality,latrine\n            construction,latrine coverage,local governments,managing\n            water resources,Physical construction,Project\n            Management,public sanitation,Public Works,rural\n            communities,rural villages,Rural Water,Rural Water\n            Supply,Sanitation infrastructure,sanitation\n            services,Sanitation strategy,sanitation\n            systems,schools,sectoral policies,social marketing,solid\n            waste,solid waste management,stagnant water,urban\n            water,urban water supply,user fees,valuable\n            information,washing,washing hands,water availability,water\n            quality,water quantity,water resources,water scarcity,Water\n            Supply,water supply facilities,water systems,water\n            usage,water user"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF023755-PHASE 4 WATER & SANITATION PROGRAM,TF021659-SWISS GRANT TO WSP FOR E.
