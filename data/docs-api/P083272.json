Lessons\n            learned from the project: When an operation, such as SAC IV,\n            involves both policy reforms and budget support activities,\n            there is a need to initiate budget support activities well\n            in advance. In hindsight, in view of high fiscal risks\n            entailed at that time, it was the correct decision on the\n            part of the Bank to limit the focus of the project's\n            cotton sector component on (i) measures to reduce the size\n            of the deficit, and (ii) strengthening the cotton pricing\n            mechanism as the first important step of the comprehensive\n            cotton sector reforms. The project demonstrated that it is\n            important to adopt a participatory approach and develop a\n            systematic communication channel with the public for the\n            success of these types of operations. It is important for\n            the Bank to be consistent in its message, which should be\n            based on technical considerations. For a SAC operation to\n            succeed, it is important to limit the number of conditionalities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Fourth Structural Adjustment

poverty reduction by strengthening fiscal policy\n            and financial sector underpinnings of stable, long-run\n            growth. Fiscal policy will be strengthened, inter alia, by\n            developing medium-term expenditure policy consistent with\n            poverty reduction objectives; strengthening the link between\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the budget;\n            and limiting budget transfers to parastatal enterprises.\n            Financial sector reform will be advanced by taking steps\n            towards strengthening of the financial system, and limiting\n            the risk of bank insolvency; (ii) improving efficiency,\n            accountability, and transparency in public expenditure\n            management. This will be achieved by strengthening budget\n            preparation, execution, and controls, increasing\n            transparency and disclosure including at decentralized\n            levels, and helping ensure better monitoring of and access\n            to basic services by the poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC-IV)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (SAC-IV)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5633230/mali-structural-adjustment-credit-sac-iv","projn":"ML-Mali:  Sac IV -- P083272","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Poverty Assessment,Economic Theory & Research,National Governance","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Mali","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050302085652"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,General public administration sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting, agricultural production,\n            allocative efficiency, Audits, balance of payments, bank\n            credit, bank insolvency, bank lending, banking system,\n            benchmarks, budget transfers, budgetary assistance, capacity\n            building, Central Bank, commercial banks, conditionality,\n            consumer price index, corruption, cost savings, counterpart,\n            Currency, Current Account, Current Account Balances, current\n            account deficits, Current expenditures, debt, debt relief,\n            decentralization/, deconcentration, democracy, devaluation,\n            Disbursements, disclosure, discount rate, Domestic\n            financing, drinking water, economic growth, Economic\n            Outlook, economic performance, economic situation,\n            elections, exchange rate, exogenous shocks, Expenditure,\n            expenditure programs, exports, Financial Accountability,\n            financial condition, Financial Control, financial deepening,\n            Financial Indicators, Financial Sector, Financial sector\n            reform, financial system, financing gap, financing sources,\n            fiscal policy, Fiscal Year, GDP, GDP deflator, Gross\n            Domestic Product, growth rate, human capital, human\n            development, imports, income, income taxes, Inflation,\n            inflation rate, Inflation Rates, institutional capacity,\n            institutional development, insurance, Interest rate,\n            interest rates, investment expenditures, leasing, M2,\n            macroeconomic performance, macroeconomic stability,\n            maturity, money market, National income, Oil, operating\n            costs, price fluctuations, private sector, privatization,\n            Procurement, public agencies, public enterprises, Public\n            Expenditure, public expenditures, Public Services, purchase\n            price, Real GDP, regulatory environment, regulatory\n            framework, Retirement, revenue mobilization, sanitation,\n            service delivery, social services, stocks, STRUCTURAL\n            ADJUSTMENT, sustainable development, sustainable growth, tax\n            revenues, taxation, Telecommunications, Terms of trade,\n            Total revenue, Transparency, transport, transportation,\n            Treasury bills, Wages"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 4 (AFTP4)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Structural Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"31609"},"facets":{}}}
