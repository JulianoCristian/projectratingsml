Some lessons learned\n            included: the Bank's preparedness criteria requires\n            that first year works should be fully designed and ready for\n            contracting as soon as the project becomes effective. Major\n            differences between expected and actual costs may often\n            result in the face of poorly designed projects. A detailed\n            monitoring and evaluation system is critical for effective\n            supervision and to adapt the project design to address\n            specific needs during implementation. Focus should not only\n            be limited to capturing the 'output' indicators\n            but also the 'outcome' indicators. A first time\n            preparation and implementation of safeguards instruments\n            requires close supervision and consistent support of the\n            client. Acquiring at detailed design stage, the Executive\n            Instrument, which in Ghana, is the document that authorizes\n            land acquisition, is key to a timely preparation and\n            implementation of a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Road Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Road Sector Development

of roads\n            following existing alignments, thus, it is expected that\n            environmental impacts will be minimal. Nevertheless, this\n            environmental assessment reviews the legal, and\n            administrative framework in Ghana, and the alternatives\n            examined for improvement of existing roads. It specifies\n            that clearing around the right-of-way, or for borrow pits\n            may threaten ecosystems, such as forests, wetlands and\n            wildlife refuges; construction works may lead to\n            sedimentation, and pollution of streams, and water bodies,\n            resulting from the operation of heavy machinery; potential\n            erosion, and inadequate drainage would increase water\n            pollution levels; and, air, and noise pollution, as a result\n            of construction, and increased traffic, may affect roadside\n            communities, in terms of health and safety problems.\n            Mitigation include: 1) installation of culverts to prevent\n            water logging, and an immediate vegetative propagation, will\n            minimize soil erosion, and sedimentation; 2) drainage\n            discharges will be appropriately located to control, and\n            manage solid wastes, fuel and oil spills, and sewage to\n            prevent water pollution; 3) likewise, groundwater leakage,\n            and pollution of water resources will be adequately\n            discharged, in accordance with sanitary measures; 4) a\n            buffer zone will be maintained to protect, and preserve\n            local flora and fauna; and, 5) spraying, and surface covers\n            will minimize dust pollution; vehicle maintenance and\n            regular working schedules would reduce noise disturbances;\n            and, traffic safety include the installation of traffic\n            signs, and provision

well as the possibility to seek\n            redress through other avenues for people not satisfied with\n            compensation. The RAP recommends the preparation of a social\n            assessment, to include the demographic, and socioeconomic\n            profile of affected populations, and an assessment of\n            potential impacts on cultural, social and economic aspects,\n            suggesting mitigation plans, and the application of a\n            framework for compensation and resettlement as follows. The\n            RAP stipulates institutional arrangements among the\n            country's agencies and units, to align and identify the\n            properties affected, followed by valuation of properties,\n            presented at public forum, and in consultation with affected\n            people. Monitoring, and assessment should follow, to adjust\n            valuation as necessary, based on database information to\n            control timing, and compensation issues. Authorization of\n            payment will be made prior to resettlement and demolition,\n            and, assistance will be provided to cover resettlement\n            costs.
