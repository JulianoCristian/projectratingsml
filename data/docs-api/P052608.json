Upper Secondary Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Upper Secondary Education Project\n            for Columbia received moderately satisfactory outcome rating\n            with modest risk to development outcome. The Bank\u0092s\n            performance was rated moderately unsatisfactory while the\n            Borrower\u0092s performance received a moderately satisfactory\n            rating. One restructuring took place during this project and\n            includes the following changes: Modification of Component 1\n            to include: (i) a design of a monitoring system of the\n            Scholarships for Tertiary Education program and (ii) to\n            specify that the design for an impact evaluation will be\n            developed. Since the first scholarships will be distributed\n            it is only possible to design the impact evaluation before\n            the project closes. The restructuring will also revise three\n            of the project\u0092s four PDO indicators, and eight of the\n            sixteen intermediate indicators, in part since the\n            government has changed its data sources to measure some\n            outcomes as well as a modification of the disbursement table\n            to (i) reallocate funds among categories of expenditure, and\n            (ii) clarify that under category. There were several lessons\n            learned from this project and are as follows: (1) it is\n            essential that Project Results Frameworks include indicators\n            to measure the expected impact of all key project activities\n            and not just a subset of activities, (2) School Improvement\n            Project (SIPs) prepared through a participatory approach can\n            be powerful instruments of change, (3) improvements in\n            school based management and competency based curriculum do\n            not translate to measurable improvements in academic results\n            within a typical project timeframe of 4-6 years, (4) A\n            decentralized and participative process to elaborate and\n            finance school subprojects is compatible with a centralized\n            management of procurement, (5) School profiles and the use\n            of performance indicators at school level are important\n            tools to devolve responsibility to local stakeholders, to\n            increase accountability and to manage by results, and (6)\n            the management of projects by regular staff is not\n            sufficient to mitigate political risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Upper Secondary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Upper Secondary\n            Education
