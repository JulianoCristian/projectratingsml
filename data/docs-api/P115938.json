Some lessons learned include: nutrition\n            indicators can improve even in the Senegal context of weak\n            and uneven economic growth. The institutional set-up in the\n            Prime Minister's office greatly enhanced coordination\n            of the policy dialogue between multiple stakeholders and\n            sectors. Effective communication for behavioral change and\n            counseling require precise messages on the promoted\n            behaviors; built on positive examples that appear easy to\n            take on; and includes a description of how the promoted\n            behavior should be accomplished. Community-based nutrition\n            is an essential platform for service delivery of other\n            social and health related packages. A de-sectoralized\n            approach to community mobilization for health and nutrition\n            has shown to produce more innovative, adaptable and\n            inclusive forms of community mobilization including pregnant\n            women solidarity clubs, grandmother forums, and religious\n            women circles in areas with large and strong brotherhoods.\n            Effective strategies to combat the multiple causes of\n            malnutrition require flexibility in the approaches to\n            address them. Cash transfers design should be responding to\n            the underlying conditions of the country context.\n            Community-based targeting is an efficient and effective way\n            of reaching the vulnerable population in rural areas. Local\n            Government participation in and verification of the\n            targeting mechanism enhanced the institutional legitimacy of\n            the cash transfer scheme. Reliability of data on the impact\n            of cash transfers is strengthened by building the scheme on\n            the existing community nutrition program and its\n            well-functioning project monitoring system. Conducting a\n            pilot scheme on cash transfers has allowed testing and\n            adjusting approaches in the design and execution that can be\n            applied to the scaling up of safety net operations. The\n            expansion of community nutrition to include safety nets can\n            strengthen the analysis and understanding of social\n            development of all stakeholders involved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Rapid Response Child-focused\n            Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition Security Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Rapid Response\n

The\n            reallocation of the credit proceeds is needed to enhance\n            project effectiveness by ensuring the funding for the\n            program's central component on sub-grants for community\n            nutrition sub-projects. The reallocation aims to strengthen\n            the support to the cash transfer program and maintain the\n            coverage and strengthen the intensity of the community-based\n            activities, particularly in light of the negative impact of\n            the external economic shocks on poverty and nutrition.  The\n            reallocation is made possible because of economies made on\n            the categories of drugs and pharmaceutical supplies,\n            consulting services, training, audits and operating costs\n            over the course of the project implementation, mainly as the\n            result of new support from other donor sources and and/or\n            increased Government contributions.  No changes are being\n            made to the development objectives, outcomes, design, or\n            scope of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Rapid Response Child-Focused\n            Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition Security Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Rapid Response\n            Child-Focused Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition Security\n            Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15571838/senegal-rapid-response-child-focused-social-cash-transfer-nutrition-security-project-restructuring","projn":"SN-Rapid Response Child-Focused Social Cash\n            Transfer And Nutrition -- P115938","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Debt Markets,Housing & Human Habitats,Regional Economic Development,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Communities and Human Settlements,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Senegal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20111222000012"},"subsc":"General education sector,Public administration- Health,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Communities and Human Settlements,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"beneficiaries, CASH TRANSFER, cash transfer\n            program, cash transfer scheme, cash transfers, community\n            nutrition, disbursement, economic shocks, equipment,\n            Expenditure, finances, financial management, food\n            insecurity, food prices, households, human development,\n            indebtedness, legal covenants, living conditions, Local\n            Governments, malnutrition, NUTRITION, payment service,\n            remittances, Trust Fund, urban areas"}},"owner":"Hlth, Nutr & Pop.
