A\n            successful reform program, which involved the restructuring\n            of the sector, gave way to a highly satisfactory Government\n            performance, including significant changes to the legal and\n            regulatory frameworks, as well as initial progress in\n            privatization and liberalization. The lessons learned\n            suggest that the provision of quality advice the Bank offers\n            in support of sector reform programs, is today, its primary\n            asset; for it was at the preparation of the project, when\n            financial leverage was high, that important reform steps\n            were taken, allowing the Borrower, Telekomunikacja Polska\n            S.A. (TPSA) to improve its financial position and to access\n            new financial sources. However, as TPSA became stronger,\n            both operationally and commercially, and developed supply\n            relationships, it became apparent that the Bank's\n            procurement guidelines - which require an International\n            Competitive Bidding process - are too time-consuming. This\n            suggests, that under certain circumstances, the Bank's\n            procurement guidelines may not be compatible with those\n            practices of successful commercial enterprises, making the\n            process unattractive to them. Loan covenants can be\n            constraining, particularly as a borrower achieves new\n            financial strength, and moves from a state enterprise to\n            commercial business, thus the need arises to amend/waive\n            covenants accordingly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
