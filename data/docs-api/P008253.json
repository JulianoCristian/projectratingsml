The main lessons\n            flowing from this project are: The Staff Appraisal Report\n            indicated that the upgrading of hospital and primary care\n            facilities would be accompanied by closures or downsizing of\n            the services provided in those facilities not selected for\n            upgrading. The project design provided no resources or\n            activities to support this streamlinin gprocess, and assumed\n            that staff redeployment and resource allocation would be\n            automatically implemented by the local health authorities.\n            The design underestimated the level of effort and resources\n            to achieve a heath service rationalization, and may have\n            overlooked the technical and poltical complexity associated\n            with such activities. In the future consider preparing a\n            regional health plan in advance of any future health service\n            rationalizationplan to ensure better integration and\n            coordination amon the different elements and stakeholders in\n            the planning process. In addition the project would have\n            benefited from strengthened maintenance management capacity,\n            a review and discussion of the main findings from technical\n            assistance activities, and allocating specific resources for\n            monitoring and evaluation. The District Health Management\n            training program offers an effective model for designing a\n            flexible recruitment of trainers.

economic transition by improving the quality of\n            basic preventive and curative health services. This will be\n            accomplished by upgrading primary and secondary facilities\n            to minimum sanitary and physical standards, improving\n            treatment skills of hospital physicians and nurses and\n            building capacity at the central and district levels to\n            manage health resources and implement sectoral reforms. The\n            project consists of a main component to rehabilitate primary\n            and secondary health services, and a complementary component\n            to build institutional capacity at the district and central\n            levels. The first main component will support: 1)\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of 100 primary health centers\n            out of an initial network of 200 in six pilot districts; 2)\n            rehabilitation and upgrading of two secondary referral\n            hospitals; 3) strengthened capacity to plan and implement a\n            comprehensive public health facilities maintenance program\n            (buildings and equipment) through development of maintenance\n            norms and staff training. The second component will provide\n            assistance to: 1) improve management of basic health\n            services at the district level; 2) provide in-service\n            training for hospital physicians and nurses; and 3) build\n            institutional capacity at the central level to improve\n            sector planning, health financing and drug distribution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Health Services Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Health Services\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/11/735090/albania-health-services-rehabilitation-project","projn":"AL-Health Services Rehabilitation Project -- P008253","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007074826"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adult mortality,basic health\n            services,beds,clean water,dental services,diet,disease\n            control,districts,doctors,economic\n            development,Economics,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,families,family planning,first aid,Health\n            Care Plan,health centers,health education,health\n            facilities,health finance,Health Financing,health\n            policy,health posts,health promotion,health sector,Health\n            Services,health status,health system,hospital beds,hospital\n            care,hospital equipment,hospital\n            management,hospitals,Housing,immunization,income,infant\n            mortality,infant mortality rate,infectious\n            diseases,inhabitants,isolation,life expectancy,low-income\n            countries,medical equipment,medical personnel,medical\n            supplies,medical technology,morbidity,mortality,Needs\n            Assessment,nurses,Pharmacy,physicians,Poverty\n            Alleviation,primary care,primary health care,private\n            sector,public health,public health services,public\n            sector,redundancy,Rehabilitation,rural areas,safety,service\n            delivery,social\n            services,sterilization,Tot,unemployment,violence,Water Supply,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"adult mortality,basic health\n            services,beds,clean water,dental services,diet,disease\n            control,districts,doctors,economic\n            development,Economics,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,families,family planning,first aid,Health\n            Care Plan,health centers,health education,health\n            facilities,health finance,Health Financing,health\n            policy,health posts,health promotion,health sector,Health\n            Services,health status,health system,hospital beds,hospital\n            care,hospital equipment,hospital\n            management,hospitals,Housing,immunization,income,infant\n            mortality,infant mortality rate,infectious\n            diseases,inhabitants,isolation,life expectancy,low-income\n            countries,medical equipment,medical personnel,medical\n            supplies,medical technology,morbidity,mortality,Needs\n            Assessment,nurses,Pharmacy,physicians,Poverty\n            Alleviation,primary care,primary health care,private\n            sector,public health,public health services,public\n            sector,redundancy,Rehabilitation,rural areas,safety,service\n            delivery,social\n            services,sterilization,Tot,unemployment,violence,Water Supply,wood"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF027981-TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CTF FOR ALBANIA,TF033404-ALBANIA - HEALTH SERVICES REHABILITATION,TF033348-ALBANIA - HEALTH SERVICES REHABILITATION,TF031160-HUNGARY - HEALTH SECTOR,TF021392-HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT","repnb":"P6373"},"facets":{}}}
