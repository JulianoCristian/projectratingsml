Some lessons learned\n            included: contracting and road management innovations can\n            improve maintenance budgeting practices as well. The two\n            innovations introduced by the project, the Pilot Project for\n            Comprehensive Maintenance by Contract (PPMC) and the Highway\n            Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-4), contributed to improve\n            Direccibn General de Concesibn de Carreteras (DGCC's)\n            maintenance budgeting. First, the PPMC, a three year\n            comprehensive maintenance program required three years for\n            implementation and therefore, its contracting made necessary\n            the approval of a multiyear budget until then not used by\n            the DGCC in its contracts. The introduction of multiyear\n            contracts will allow in Secretariat of Communications and\n            Transport (SCT) to tender bigger works in the future, which\n            until now have been split in different contracts to allow\n            for execution in one year and a half for budgetary reasons\n            (there is a six month grace period to end the works\n            contracted out in the previous fiscal year. Second, the\n            HDM-4 requires improved and expanded inventories and basic\n            data on road condition and allows for in-depth analyses of\n            current asset capacity and condition, service demand over a\n            considerable horizon, detailed assessments, and multi-year\n            maintenance plans. Funding for road maintenance becomes more\n            stable when the planning process improves and enough\n            resources are allocated to projects. The project routine\n            maintenance share was originally 30 percent periodic\n            maintenance was 50 percent, reconstruction was 9 percent,\n            and highways signposts represented 10.5 percent. A SCT\n            recommendation at the end of the program was that the share\n            of routine maintenance in future similar contracts should be\n            higher, not less than 50 percent. In this respect, it is\n            worth to mention that the PPCM, as designed, had a routine\n            and periodic maintenance share of about 80 percent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Federal

the Second\n            Highways Rehabilitation Project, particularly regarding\n            potential involuntary resettlement by indigenous\n            populations, since marginal groups were identified, namely\n            few indigenous populations, migrant rural workers, and small\n            suburban communities, who could suffer adverse social\n            impacts. However, the report stipulates that the right of\n            way will not be affected, i.e., resettlement issues\n            resulting from land acquisition will not occur, since\n            basically, the federal road network encompasses already\n            developed urban areas. Furthermore, the Ministry of\n            Communications and Transport should provide progress reports\n            on the implementation of each subproject in compliance with\n            the right of way, and, relevant information on the traffic\n            generated should be made available, to estimate beneficial,\n            or negative impacts on local populations, a measure which\n            should be incorporated in all roads and highway projects. In\n            addition, the SA indicates that highway projects mostly\n            generate beneficial social aspects, since they improve the\n            economy, as commercial activity increases; promote cultural\n            activities, as regional, national, and international tourism\n            increases; and, improve social aspects, as increased access\n            to education, health, and social benefits facilitate the\n            well-being of distant populations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Second Highway Rehabilitation\n            Project : social assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"M\u00e9xico - Segundo Proyecto de\n            Rehabilitaci\u00f3n de Carreteras: Evaluaci\u00f3n social"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/08/717502/mexico-second-highway-rehabilitation-project-social-assessment","projn":"MX-Federal Highway Maintenance Project -- P065779","docty":"Social Assessment","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00112805302445"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Roads and highways,Central government administration","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Social assessments; Highway projects;\n            Vulnerable groups; Indigenous populations; Migrant workers;\n            Subprojects; Legal & regulatory framework; Access to\n            education; Access to health care; Social protection systems;\n            Right of way; Reporting systems; Traffic surveys;\n            Commercialization; Productivity growth; Economic growth;\n            Tourism development"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"21322"},"facets":{}}}
