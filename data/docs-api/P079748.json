Some lessons learned\n            included: to ensure intersectoral coordination, a champion\n            is imperative. To ensure that interinstitutional\n            coordination efforts are sustained throughout program\n            implementation and beyond, it is essential that an entity\n            take a leading role in overseeing these efforts,\n            particularly as participating entities undergo an initial\n            learning process and define their functions within\n            intersectoral working groups. Finance Secretariat (SHCP) and\n            Environment and Natural Resources Secretariat (SEMARNAT)\n            assumed this coordinating role, helping to ensure the\n            success of the Program's coordination efforts. A\n            relevant set of monitorable and meaningful outcome\n            indicators should be established at the outset of a program,\n            along with clearly-defined baseline and target values to\n            monitor progress and evaluate outcomes. Some of the\n            indicators established for the Environment DPL Program were\n            overly complex and ambitious. Further, although target\n            values were defined during the course of program\n            implementation, the lack of a definition of baseline and\n            target values at the outset made it more difficult to assess\n            the program's overall progress during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - First Programmatic Environment\n            Structural Adjustment Loan
