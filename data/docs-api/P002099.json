The primary objective of the project was\n            to initiate the establishment of a mechanism for financing\n            urban infrastructure using selected merchant banks to\n            identify, appraise, supervise and cofinance sub-projects\n            executed by the States. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) the project\n            implementation clearly indicated the deficiency in manpower\n            capacity at the various levels; (ii) the issue of\n            post-implementation maintenance of projects has been further\n            accentuated by the project; (iii) in order to sustain the\n            long term financing of urban development, the IDF project\n            has pointed to the need to further address institutional\n            arrangement for funding urban projects; and (iv)
