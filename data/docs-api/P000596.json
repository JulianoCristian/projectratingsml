Conversely, the Borrower's\n            performance was unsatisfactory, based on the\n            Government's inability to strengthen macroeconomic\n            policies. Lessons drawn from the project are as follows.\n            First, social sector projects in Comoros should reinforce -\n            and include in project design - the need for dynamic local\n            communities to participate in the mobilization of human\n            resources; thus, the country should envisage reforms to\n            reduce civil service, and instead increase the ratio of\n            government revenues to GDP, beyond fifteen percent. Second,\n            the approach taken in testing sub-project preparation,\n            financing, and supervision, before committing a large amount\n            of resources proved highly successful, i.e., the Social Fund\n            was prepared before Board approval of the project, was\n            highly successful, and its implementation progressed\n            smoothly. However, operating costs for a newly established\n            Social Fund, within the context of the Comoros, is\n            supposedly high, a fact which although legitimate, increased\n            unexpected administrative costs. And third, beneficiary cost\n            sharing, enabled the health system to continue operations,\n            despite the lack of government funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Population and Human Resources Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comoros -

The project has two components: population and\n            health; and community development. The population and health\n            component will build upon existing successful pilot programs\n            for self-management and cost-recovery to establish services\n            capable of ensuring cost-effective and sustainable provision\n            of comprehensive and good quality health care, including\n            family planning and AIDS control services. To that end, the\n            component will: (a) strengthen the capacities of the three\n            health regions to plan, implement, administer, and supervise\n            health care services, in part through improving and\n            expanding the training of district health personnel; (ii)\n            equip and rehabilitate two regional hospitals and a number\n            of health centers; and (iii) promote family planning and\n            AIDS control services. In the second component,\n            complementary community development activities as well as\n            activities to encourage sustainable economic development\n            will be supported through a CDSF. While demand driven, the\n            CDSF will focus primarily on: training of communities and\n            groups in micro-project development, management, and\n            implementation; rehabilitation of social infastructure\n            (especially primary schools, water supply, and health\n            posts); activities to promote the well-being and development\n            of women; and income generating activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Population and Human Resources Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comoros - Population and Human\n
