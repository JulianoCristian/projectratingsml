The experiences and\n            lessons learned from the project can be summarized as the\n            follows. High turnover within the project implementation\n            unit (PIU) and staff shortage towards the end of the\n            project, affected project management. This was because the\n            staff were hired on a temporary basis, and scheduled to\n            leave by the end of the loan process, whereas the\n            disbursement process and evaluation report preparation\n            remained for four months after the loan closing date. These\n            problems could be solved by assigning more government\n            officers to work at the PIU. Nevertheless, effective\n            inspections of project outputs were an important factor to\n            ensure the quality of each sub-project. Under this project,\n            each project steering committee examined the deliverables\n            carefully, and would not approve the outputs unless project\n            objectives were met, as well as all of the requirements\n            stated in the terms of reference (TORs). Lastly, this\n            project can be regarded as a good practice for executing a\n            technical assistance project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Economic Management Assistance
