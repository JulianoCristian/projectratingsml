The Bank's and\n            Borrower's performances were satisfactory for all three\n            projects. Three lessons were cited: 1) Decentralization\n            requires an enabling institutional environment including: a\n            long term commitment, a demand-driven approach including\n            beneficiary contributions, clear institutional roles and\n            guidance for all stakeholders, and a common implementation\n            modality for all actors. 2) A major drive to build\n            implementation capacity is essential including: major\n            training for local governments, communities and private\n            sector support services, emphasis on up-front capacity\n            building before investment in infrastructure, strong central\n            coordination including monitoring and evaluation, and\n            integration of hygiene education alongside the investment\n            program; and 3)  Sustainability needs to be a central focus\n            including: priority on raising revenues for operations and\n            maintenance, institutional adjustments to improve revenue\n            collection, self-sustaining support services from the\n            private sector, and follow-on training for the local\n            governments and community organizations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

The project\n            became effective on 7/19/2000, almost eleven month after\n            Board presentation. This was the major initial problem. The\n            two effectiveness conditions, which took a long time to be\n            resolved, were: (i) the nomination of the Central Water\n            Sanitation Agency (CWSA) Board, and (ii) Parliamentary\n            approval of the subsidiary grant agreement between the\n            Government and CWSA. There was a close follow up of the\n            effectiveness issue by the Bank through the resident mission\n            and the 2000 CPPR was instrumental in raising to the\n            attention of Government of Ghana (GOG) senior managers the\n            urgency of obtaining Parliamentary approval for all pending\n            subsidiary grants agreement under Bank credits. With regard\n            to the issue of harmonization of the water supply/sanitation\n            policies, the Bank team has been very proactive in reaching\n            out to other donors with a view to convince them to adopt a\n            common sector wide approach, and progress is being made.\n            Conditions for effectiveness have to be strictly minimized\n            and reduced to the legal opinion and the signing of\n            subsidiary agreements, if and when applicable.

The Second Community Water and\n            Sanitation Project (CWSP2) will be implemented in three\n            3-year phases. The first phase for CWSP2 aims to increase\n            service coverage, and achieve effective and sustained use of\n            improved community water and sanitation in villages and\n            small towns in four regions. There are two main project\n            components. The Community Subprojects component provides\n            grants to communities and schools through their district\n            assemblies for construction of water and sanitation\n            facilities and finances technical assistance and community\n            development activities to strengthen community capacity to\n            plan, implement, operate, and maintain water and sanitation\n            facilities in an effective and sustainable manner.
