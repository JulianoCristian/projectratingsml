Some lessons learned includes: sector\n            development policy lending for the agriculture sector has\n            proven to be an effective, flexible instrument that\n            empowered the Government of Ghana to implement a\n            country-owned policy and the related programs. An important\n            lesson for future operations is to ensure that the policy\n            agenda underlying the operation is complementary to the\n            Bank's and other development partners' investment\n            lending operations, thus creating synergies that enhance the\n            policy making process as well as program implementation. The\n            design of Agriculture Development Policy Operation (AgDPO)\n            policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are major\n            undertakings that need to be better integrated in Ministry\n            of Food and Agriculture's (MoFA's) planning\n            process.

is to support the Government's efforts to\n            encourage agriculture led growth to achieve the objectives\n            of the Ghana's Second Growth and Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy (GPRS II). In harmony with other development\n            partners, the proposed Development Policy Operation (DPO)\n            will support the implementation of Ghana's Food and\n            Agriculture Sector Development Policy (FASDEP). This\n            operation will support planning and budgeting processes that\n            take into account the multi-sector and economy wide linkages\n            that support agricultural growth. By linking lending to the\n            implementation of the revised FASDEP and the evolution of\n            the sector wide approach, this operation will support the\n            sector's objective of supporting broad based growth and\n            increased private sector investments. Using the\n            Government's budget procedures, the proposed operation\n            will also help strengthen the decentralization process,\n            especially as related to agriculture. The main risks are:\n            (i) political risk associated with the 2008 election\n            campaign (low); (ii) continued delays in decentralization\n            process (low); (iii) delays in the completion of the SWAP\n            framework (moderate); and (iv) delays in budget allocations\n            and releases (moderate). This risk could be mitigated by\n            deepening the dialogue on expenditure frameworks and the\n            budget process, including GPRS II financing discussions held\n            at the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)/ Multi-Donor\n            Budget Support (MDBS) level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Second Agriculture SWAP (AGSSP
