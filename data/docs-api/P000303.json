And, while the performance of the Borrower is\n            rated marginally satisfactory, based on the delays in\n            meeting credit effectiveness, and on weak financial\n            management, the performance by the Bank is unsatisfactory,\n            given the fact that supervision missions not only failed to\n            include the necessary skill mix, but were not frequent\n            enough. Key lessons are as follows. Targeted assistance in\n            the form of one-time subsidies for income generating assets,\n            will lift beneficiaries out of poverty subsistence, and into\n            the cash economy. Consequently, targeted subsidies for\n            income generating activities, will in turn promote, rather\n            than impede, the development of decentralized financial\n            institutions; thus, careful project design would minimize\n            overhead costs. A systematic review of the implementation\n            arrangements should be undertaken by the implementation team\n            for each component, to allow for potential redesign if need\n            be, and to focus on management arrangements, which may avoid\n            unnecessary expenditures resulting from managing income\n            generating activities. It is reinforced that beneficiary\n            involvement, though not a guarantee to success, would lead\n            to lower costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Food Security and Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso -
