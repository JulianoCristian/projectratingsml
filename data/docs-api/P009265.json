(iii) a training program for the staff of ROs,\n            maintenance enterprises and engineering institutions; and\n            (iv) provision of equipment for road maintenance in Croatia.\n            The main emphasis is on improvements and rehabilitation of\n            the TYH in Vojvodina and Macedonia and the rehabilitation of\n            other primary routes, including sections of the Adriatic\n            Highway in Montenegro and Kosovo."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Second Highway Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Second Highway\n            Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/09/740448/yugoslavia-second-highway-sector-project","projn":"Highway Sector Ii-115839 -- P009265","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Economics,Airports and Air Services,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Transport","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926074259"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,airports,assembly,axle\n            load,bicycles,bottlenecks,bridges,Buses,carriers,Civil\n            Engineering,Construction,construction and\n            rehabilitation,corridor,current prices,debt,debt\n            service,debt\n            servicing,decentralization,depreciation,economic\n            conditions,EIB,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,framework,freight,freight transport,Fuel,Fuel\n            tax,Gravel,handling,heavy vehicles,Highway,Highway\n            Design,Highway Projects,highway\n            safety,highways,inflation,inland waterways,international\n            traffic,lane standard,laws,load\n            factors,loading,motorcycles,now accounts,oil\n            prices,Passenger,passenger cars,Passenger\n            traffic,Pavement,pavement management,pavement management\n            system,pavement strengthening,ports,primary roads,provincial\n            governments,Provincial Roads,public transport,Railway\n            Transport,Railways,range,Rate of Return,reference,resource\n            allocation,road authorities,road construction,road\n            improvement,road improvements,road infrastructure,road\n            investment,Road Maintenance,Road Network,road pavements,road\n            planning,road tolls,road traffic,Road Transport,road\n            transport industry,road user charges,road user\n            costs,roads,route,routes,savings,speed,Structural\n            Adjustment,tax,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,Tolls,tractors,Traffic,Traffic Growth,traffic\n            levels,Traffic Safety,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport modes,transport planning,Transport\n            Projects,transport tariffs,trucking,trucks,Vehicle Registration,Vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,airports,assembly,axle\n            load,bicycles,bottlenecks,bridges,Buses,carriers,Civil\n            Engineering,Construction,construction and\n            rehabilitation,corridor,current prices,debt,debt\n            service,debt\n            servicing,decentralization,depreciation,economic\n            conditions,EIB,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,framework,freight,freight transport,Fuel,Fuel\n            tax,Gravel,handling,heavy vehicles,Highway,Highway\n            Design,Highway Projects,highway\n            safety,highways,inflation,inland waterways,international\n            traffic,lane standard,laws,load\n            factors,loading,motorcycles,now accounts,oil\n            prices,Passenger,passenger cars,Passenger\n            traffic,Pavement,pavement management,pavement management\n            system,pavement strengthening,ports,primary roads,provincial\n            governments,Provincial Roads,public transport,Railway\n            Transport,Railways,range,Rate of Return,reference,resource\n            allocation,road authorities,road construction,road\n            improvement,road improvements,road infrastructure,road\n            investment,Road Maintenance,Road Network,road pavements,road\n            planning,road tolls,road traffic,Road Transport,road\n            transport industry,road user charges,road user\n            costs,roads,route,routes,savings,speed,Structural\n            Adjustment,tax,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,Tolls,tractors,Traffic,Traffic Growth,traffic\n            levels,Traffic Safety,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport modes,transport planning,Transport\n            Projects,transport tariffs,trucking,trucks,Vehicle Registration,Vehicles"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","repnb":"6748"},"facets":{}}}
