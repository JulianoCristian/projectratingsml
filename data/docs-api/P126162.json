(2) The extensive analytical\n            work and technical assistance on poverty alleviation, shared\n            prosperity, and PFM prior to the DPL were critical in\n            identifying the reform program. (3) The presence of a strong\n            government counterpart to serve as coordinator was an\n            important success factor in a loan involving multiple

the Government of\n            Indonesia (GOI) achieve its medium-term growth and poverty\n            reduction objectives through strengthened public finance\n            management, and poverty alleviation and service delivery\n            efforts. The INSTANSI DPL to Indonesia, for USD 300 million,\n            marks the beginning of a new series of annual single-tranche\n            DPLs. The operation is deeply rooted on the previous DPL\n            series that consisted of: (i) first DPL series (DPLs 1-4),\n            which was implemented from 2004 to 2007 and anchored to the\n            FY04-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): (ii) second DPL\n            series (DPLs 5-6) that was implemented from 2008-2009; and\n            (iii) third DPL series, which was initially set out as a\n            three-year DPL series (DPLs 7-9) to be implemented from\n            2010-2012. Initially focused on supporting the GoI's\n            macroeconomic stabilization efforts, the previous DPL series\n            covered a broad range of reform efforts aimed at improving\n            the investment climate, strengthening public financial\n            management and enhancing poverty alleviation and service\n            delivery. Given that the reform agenda is far from finished\n            and an extension of the reforms is needed, the GoI has\n            requested to terminate the ongoing third DPL series (DPLs\n            7-9) a year earlier and present the INSTANSI DPL as a new,\n            two-year series. This new DPL series is still anchored under\n            the FY09-12 country partnership strategy, and continues to\n            deepen the reforms supported under the previous DPL series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Institutional, Tax\n            Administration, Social and Investment Development Policy\n            Loan
