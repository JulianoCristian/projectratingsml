The lessons learned indicate that the\n            financial sector adjustment operations need to be based on\n            prior economic and sector work. Financial sector adjustment\n            operations should set limited objectives. Over-ambitious\n            objectives such as the restoration of the solvency and\n            soundness of the banking system are long-term goals that go\n            beyond a single operation. Bank restructuring operations\n            should disburse against the completed resolution of specific\n            bank cases, not against the promise of future actions which\n            may not materialize.

progress in\n            implementing the Program, and reports on actions taken by\n            the Government of Mexico to meet specific conditions for the\n            release of the Third Tranche. Waiver for the condition of\n            the Regulatory Reform Program, as contained in the\n            agreements is sought on the grounds set therein. Based on\n            the assessment that: a) the National Banking and Securities\n            Commission (CNBV), and the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) have\n            approved other important new prudential rules that\n            contribute to improving the health, and stability of the\n            financial sector; and, b) the Asset Disposal Program, and\n            the Bank Resolution Program have been implemented on a\n            consistent basis with the implementation letter, exceeding\n            the minimum requirements for compliance, this memorandum\n            recommends that a waiver be granted with respect to the\n            pending conditions, and the Third Tranche be released. The\n            Project supports the Government of Mexico's second\n            phase of its Bank Restructuring Program, which includes up\n            front measures to improve the legal and regulatory\n            framework, for a safer operation of the Mexican financial\n            sector, and the sale, merger or liquidation of the remaining\n            insolvent banks under government control. Compliance with\n            the tranche release conditions is discussed, specifying\n            actions under the Regulatory Reform Program - amendment to\n            the rules applicable to external audit reports, and\n            introduction of new rules to regulate the risk of banking\n            operations through the internet - have not been met.\n            However, given that the National Banking and Securities\n            Commission (CNBV) has issued other important new regulatory\n            rules that contribute to strengthening the governance in the\n            banking sector, a waiver of compliance with the Third\n            Tranche requirements, is justified."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Second Bank Restructuring Facility\n            Adjustment Loan

to the private sector. The\n            project will support additional legal, and regulatory\n            reforms, to strengthen governance in the banking sector,\n            extend the new capital, and credit portfolio classification\n            regulations to public banks, and, provide an early warning\n            system. It will also involve the resolution of the remaining\n            banks under the Bank Savings Protection Institute's\n            (IPAB) purview, which includes the restructuring, and\n            sale/liquidation of Bancrecer, and liquidation of seven\n            smaller intervened banks. Funding will help finance part of\n            IPAB's debt-servicing needs arising from the\n            implementation of its bank resolution program, complementing\n            other sources of funds available to IPAB, such as fiscal\n            transfers, proceeds from asset disposal/recovery, and fees\n            from deposit insurance premiums. Although the project will\n            be beneficial in reducing the potential repeat of the\n            1994/95 banking crisis, risks include IPAB's limited\n            ability to refinance its debt, potentially facing increased\n            limitations in its capacity to capitalize and sell, or\n            unwind and liquidate, troubled banks. Moreover, IPAB's\n            large debt issues associated with the resolution process,\n            could imply higher, volatile interest rates than otherwise.\n            Nonetheless, the transactional nature of the loan\n            disbursements, and its legal monitoring, would reduce those risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Second Bank Restructuring Facility\n
