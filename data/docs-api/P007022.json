The following were the\n            main objectives of the project: (a) to bring the highway\n            network to acceptable operating standards through a program\n            of road rehabilitation and periodic and routine maintenance;\n            (b) to improve and strengthen the institutional capability\n            of the Secretariat of Public Works (SEOPC) to plan and\n            maintain the road system; (c) to increase the availability\n            of road operating equipment; (d) to improve the quality of\n            pavements and pavement construction techniques; (e) to\n            strengthen the domestic construction industry. The economic\n            indicators are satisfactory, although not to the extent\n            anticipated in the SAR. In general, the overall outcome of\n            the project is satisfactory. One notable lesson learned from\n            this project is how much of its success was owed to the\n            firm, open, and continuous cooperation between local staff\n            and the Bank's supervision missions. A further lesson\n            is that the costs of civil works must be based on more\n            conservative diagnostic studies of the structural condition\n            of the roads and on the implementation periods for projects.\n            In addition, designs for such works, which have\n            conventionally been produced by the SEOPC, should be\n            contracted out sufficiently in advance to qualified\n            consulting firms, so as to avoid the types of problem that\n            have occurred in this and previous projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic -

The project would\n            comprise : i) rehabilitation of 839 km of roads; ii) a\n            program of periodic maintenance; iii) a program of workshop\n            reconstruction; iv)
