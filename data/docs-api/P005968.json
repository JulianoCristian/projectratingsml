The Panel also finds that the\n            reservoir does not cause contamination of the Parana River\n            and the creeks.

The second set of claims alleges that a\n            proposed wastewater treatment plant, to be built in\n            Encarnacion, would further pollute the environment. The\n            third set of claims alleges that the families affected by\n            the raising of the reservoir level were not all identified.\n            The fourth set of claims alleges that the resettlement and\n            income restoration programs are not being properly\n            implemented.

The Yacyreta Project extends more than two decades,\n            and, its social and environmental parts are partly financed\n            under both the Argentina, and Paraguay loans. This report\n            concludes the Panel's investigation into allegations in\n            the Request for Inspection submitted in May 2002. It\n            adresses Bank environmental compliance issues raised by the\n            complaint: the adequacy of environmental assessments, the\n            relationship between the level of the reservoir and urban\n            flooding, and ground water levels, the water-related health\n            problems, and, the location and design of the sewage\n            treatment plant. It finds the environmental screening\n            process was appropriate. However, on reviewing the\n            environmental assessments and resettlement plans, it was\n            found these to be very inadequate, not in compliance with\n            the Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.01. It considers\n            the biophysical environment, and urban and peri-urban\n            environments, finding that both environmental and social\n            assessments should have anticipated the induced effects\n            associated with the Project, that construction of the\n            Yacyreta dam has a negligible effect on the water level of\n            the Parana river at Encarnacion, especially in times of\n            flood, that the reservoir is frequently operated under\n            excessive water production levels, and that this is not\n            consistent with neither the loan agreement, nor the Third\n            Owners Agreement, as amended. Moreover, the Panel confirms\n            that flooding makes the drinking water unsafe, however, it\n            finds that the alleged causal relationship between the level\n            of the Yacyreta reservoir, and pollution of wells and\n            flooding of latrines is not correct, while the existence of\n            the monitoring program was verified, reviewed, and no\n            evidence contradicting the findings was found, and, confirms\n            that the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay\n            adequately monitors the incidence of both disease, and\n            disease vectors. Importantly, the Panel finds that\n            responsibility for the cost of connection to the sewer\n            system may become a significant source of conflict, and\n            needs urgent attention of Bank Management. The Panel finds\n            persuasive evidence of erroneous omissions on the number of\n            people present at the 1990 census, thus making them\n            ineligible for Project compensation and resettlement\n            benefits, and, that this sole basis for restoration of\n            income does not satisfy OD 4.30's requirement for many\n            affected people, and, that grievance mechanisms were neither\n            in compliance with the directive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Fifth Power Project (SEGBA V),\n            and Paraguay - Water and

The Request cites that the building\n            of the dam on the Parana River also caused the healthy\n            drinking water to be polluted and that the building of\n            housing settlements along the river also caused more\n            pollution of drinking water. A waste management plant that\n            was planned will not benefit the neighborhoods along the\n            river and the group believes that pollution will be\n            irreparable. The stagnant water in the reservoir behind the\n            dam also causes concern because of microorganisms and the\n            harboring of diseases.  The response submits that the area\n            flooded had been a floodplain and was usually flooded before\n            the implementation of the dam.  As a result of a large\n            passage of time between the raising of the reservoir water\n            and the resettlement of communities, new groups of people\n            entered the area and settled in areas that were to be\n            resettled.
