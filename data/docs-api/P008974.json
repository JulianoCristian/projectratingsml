There are several lessons to be\n            learned: 1) In designing projects, the implementation\n            environment (including macro-economic, political, sectoral\n            factors) in a country for Bank assistance needs to be\n            carefully reviewed as a whole to apply lessons learned. 2)\n            Before introducing a system, implications of its costs on\n            the state investment and recurrent cost budget needs to be\n            analyzed. 3) Diversity of circumstances among beneficiaries\n            and regions must be considered in the design; blanket\n            prescriptions do not work. 4) Initiation of any second phase\n            must depend on a thorough review of the ongoing project\n            regarding implementation problems at the central and field\n            level. 5) Solid monitoring data must be available to be able\n            to make modifications during implementation. Therefore, a\n            simple but effective monitoring and evaluation system needs\n            to be established earlier in the project. 6) Strengthening\n            of the beneficiaries position (farmers' organization)\n            to formulate demand is needed to improve the performance of\n            the organization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Second Agricultural Extension and\n
