The social assessment depicts an\n            existing social participation strategy, with strong emphasis\n            on social participation, community and municipal-level\n            decision taking. The IPP details characteristics of the\n            indigenous population, their social and cultural context,\n            and defines ways to strengthen a socio-cultural\n            participation strategy, specific for indigenous communities,\n            and municipalities. One major finding indicates that\n            indigenous communities' access to the benefits of the\n            previous Municipal Project, have been more than\n            proportional, but there
