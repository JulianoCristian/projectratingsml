Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the Department of Finance (DOF) suggested that the Bank look\n            into the creation of greater flexibility on disbursement ;\n            (ii) the government also suggested that the Bank reconsider\n            its audit requirements for adjustment loans; and (iii) the\n            Government also noted that this program would have

The program\n            addresses those areas which are considered essential for\n            integrating all regions of the Philippine economy with the\n            rest of the world. These include: (a) macroeconomic\n            management through improvement of Central Bank finances and\n            appropriate energy pricing policies; (b) promotion of\n            investment through implementation of a new foreign\n            investment act, privatization and encouragement of private\n            participation in infrastructure projects; (c)\n            rationalization of the tariff regime and removal of\n            quantitative restrictions on imports; (d) introduction of\n            greater competition into land and sea transport; and (e)\n            removal of restrictions on foreign exchange transactions on\n            both the current and capital accounts. The loan will finance\n            general imports of goods at a time when foreign reserves are\n            being reduced by the needs of the debt and debt service\n            reduction operation and an incipient investment recovery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Economic Integration Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Economic\n            Integration Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/11/735417/philippines-economic-integration-program","projn":"PH-Economic Integration -- P004606","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961003084543"},"subsc":"Banking,General transportation sector,General industry and trade sector,General energy sector,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"bonds,borrowing,capital goods,Central\n            Bank,commercial bank debt,consolidation,Debt,Debt\n            Service,deficits,deposits,Development\n            Assistance,devolution,dividends,economic activity,Economic\n            Integration,Economic Recovery,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exports,foreign exchange,foreign exchange\n            reserves,GDP,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Gross National\n            Product,imports,income,income\n            support,indexation,inflation,interest\n            rates,legislation,M2,monetary policy,Oil,oil\n            prices,population growth,pricing policies,private\n            sector,private sector investment,privatization,public\n            Investments,public sector,public sector deficit,public\n            works,real sector,structural adjustment,sustainable\n            growth,tax,tax collection,transport,trough,value\n            added,wholesale prices"},"1":{"cdata!":"bonds,borrowing,capital goods,Central\n            Bank,commercial bank debt,consolidation,Debt,Debt\n            Service,deficits,deposits,Development\n            Assistance,devolution,dividends,economic activity,Economic\n            Integration,Economic Recovery,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exports,foreign exchange,foreign exchange\n            reserves,GDP,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Gross National\n            Product,imports,income,income\n            support,indexation,inflation,interest\n            rates,legislation,M2,monetary policy,Oil,oil\n            prices,population growth,pricing policies,private\n            sector,private sector investment,privatization,public\n            Investments,public sector,public sector deficit,public\n            works,real sector,structural adjustment,sustainable\n            growth,tax,tax collection,transport,trough,value\n            added,wholesale prices"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"P5881"},"facets":{}}}
