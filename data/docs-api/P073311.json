Some lessons\n            learned included: as a local Cambodian Non-Governmental\n            Organization (NGO), Center for Development (CfD) which\n            worked for other donors as well was effective in empowering\n            communities to become actors in local development projects.\n            CfD's approach of awareness-raising, social\n            mobilization and increasing access to improved facilities\n            can be considered a model for replication, especially for\n            projects where demand needs to be triggered at the\n            grassroots level. At the same time, it should be recognized\n            that an NGO's weak capacity and lack of familiarity\n            with Bank procedures are challenges for an NGO to implement\n            Bank-financed projects, and mitigation measures should be\n            included. As social mobilization agents, Clean Water Groups\n            (CWGs) provided clear benefits to their communities,\n            including the Private Water Operators (PWOs), with little or\n            no reward in return. Rather than relying solely on official\n            local leaders at the village and commune levels, the CWG\n            served as an effective, valued-added community\n            representative for the success of local development\n            activities. It is important to conduct a water consumption\n            survey during project preparation stage in order to get a\n            clear estimate of the water consumption rate. As water\n            consumption has deep financial implications, conducting such\n            a survey could avoid the possibility of over estimating or\n            underestimating consumption, thereby minimizing any\n            potential financial loss for the utility company. Given the\n            innovative private sector participation component for\n            Cambodia, the project should have included a specific\n            Technical Assistance (TA) component to train prospective\n            bidders on Bank procurement procedures, and on how to\n            prepare responsive technical and financial bids, instead of\n            leaving this task to the Mekong Private Sector Development\n            Facility, which was not formally a part of the project. Such\n            training may have stimulated private sector response even more."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Provincial and Peri-Urban Water\n            Supply and Sanitation
