This report is based on the\n            Implementation Completion Report for the project, legal\n            documents and project files, and discussions with Bank staff\n            involved in the project. The ratings of the PPAR generally\n            concur with the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            ratings, except in the following instances : outcome (ICR\n            satisfactory, PPAR moderately satisfactory); borrower\n            performance (ICR highly satisfactory, PPAR satisfactory). A\n            number of lessons emerged form the experience of the PFHP\n            which may inform future operations in Vietnam and elsewhere,\n            both for population and family planning activities and for\n            improving the effectiveness of programs more generally. Some\n            of those lessons are : population policy and family planning\n            in countries undergoing the transition to a market economy\n            need to adapt to the increasing role of the private sector\n            as a provider. It is critically important that population\n            and the reproductive health programs reach out to unmarried\n            young adults, in order to promote highly effective temporary\n            methods of birth control, prevent unwanted pregnancy and\n            recourse to abortion, and prevent HIV/AIDS and other\n            sexually transmitted disease. In order to attribute changes\n            in outcome to public policy, programs need to document their\n            inputs and outputs over time and to monitor other factors\n            outside of the program that plausibly could account for\n            those outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Population and Family Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Population

The members from\n            the various ministries and agencies represented in the\n            Committee were heavily involved in project preparation, so\n            they understood it well and could implement it effectively.\n            There was a high level of ownership and transparency from\n            the communes upwards.

These components consist of: service\n            delivery; information, education and communication;\n            contraceptive supplies, family planning management and\n            institutional development; and service delivery model initiative."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Viet Nam - Population and Family Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Viet Nam - Population and Family\n            Health Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/12/732622/viet-nam-population-family-health-project","projn":"VN-Population & Family Health -- P004841","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Adolescent Health","teratopic":"Agriculture,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008060836"},"subsc":"Health,Central Government","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture,Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Abortion,Abortion Rate,abortion rates,access\n            to services,Agriculture,anaemia,basic health services,basic\n            social services,births,child\n            health,Cities,commodities,contraceptive method,Contraceptive\n            Prevalence,contraceptive supplies,contraceptive\n            use,contraceptives,counseling,Dairy Products,Drug\n            Supply,drugs,equipment,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,extension,families,Family Planning,family\n            planning services,family welfare,food intake,health care\n            costs,health financing,health interventions,health\n            services,immunization,Infant Mortality,Infant Mortality\n            Rate,infants,integration,managers,medical\n            supplies,Mortality,Mortality Rate,national\n            health,Nutrition,obstetric care,partnership,poverty\n            alleviation,pregnancy,prevalence of anaemia,Primary Health\n            Care,private sector,public health,public sector,public\n            services,Rehabilitation,reproductive health,reproductive\n            health care,reproductive health services,reproductive\n            tract,reproductive tract infections,safe delivery,service\n            delivery,social services,sterilization,tetanus,vulnerable\n            groups,Workers,young women"},"1":{"cdata!":"Abortion,Abortion Rate,abortion rates,access\n            to services,Agriculture,anaemia,basic health services,basic\n            social services,births,child\n            health,Cities,commodities,contraceptive method,Contraceptive\n            Prevalence,contraceptive supplies,contraceptive\n            use,contraceptives,counseling,Dairy Products,Drug\n            Supply,drugs,equipment,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,extension,families,Family Planning,family\n            planning services,family welfare,food intake,health care\n            costs,health financing,health interventions,health\n            services,immunization,Infant Mortality,Infant Mortality\n            Rate,infants,integration,managers,medical\n            supplies,Mortality,Mortality Rate,national\n            health,Nutrition,obstetric care,partnership,poverty\n            alleviation,pregnancy,prevalence of anaemia,Primary Health\n            Care,private sector,public health,public sector,public\n            services,Rehabilitation,reproductive health,reproductive\n            health care,reproductive health services,reproductive\n            tract,reproductive tract infections,safe delivery,service\n            delivery,social services,sterilization,tetanus,vulnerable\n            groups,Workers,young women"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF038098-VIETNAM POPULATION AND FAMILY\n            HEALTH PROJECT,TF038047-VIETNAM - POPULATION AND FAMILY\n            HEALTH PROJECT,TF036846-VIETNAM - POPULATION AND FAMILY\n            HEALTH PROJECT,TF031350-VIETNAM - POPULATION AND HEALTH,TF022761-PHRD-POPULATION & FAMILY\n            HEALTH PROJECT","repnb":"P6701"},"facets":{}}}
