To produce development results, the\n            Bank needs to pay attention to the design of the credit, the\n            quality of prior actions, and their relation to the expected\n            outcomes. PRSCs are unlikely to be as effective as\n            investment and sector operations for solving specific sector\n            issues. The PRSCs tended to cover macroeconomic and sector\n            issues in a broad manner, making it difficult to cultivate\n            ownership in the agencies responsible for implementing the\n            program. The assistance is more likely to succeed when the\n            Bank targets specific problems and works their solution with\n            the agencies in charge of executing the program. A program\n            of budget support tends to create a higher permanent level\n            of Government expenditure that may not be sustainable in the\n            medium term. Predictable budget support may create\n            inflexibilities in expenditure, forcing donors to continue\n            their support beyond what is needed and desirable. Uganda\n            exemplifies this situation as the PRSC series grew over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit

Two annual PRSCs were approved\n            for the Government of Uganda (GOU) in 2001 and 2002. The\n            PRSCs are expected to serve the country's strategy of\n            reducing poverty and improving public service delivery by\n            addressing public sector issues and initiating institutional\n            and policy reform measures. As part of the reform measures,\n            efforts were undertaken to induce transparency and reduce\n            corruption in government proceedings. Public access to\n            government information was improved and social and internal\n            accountability mechanisms were put in place. Simplified\n            versions of the budget and budget performance reports were\n            published for citizen access, public notices on fiscal\n            transfers were posted at service delivery points, and key\n            policy issues were disseminated through the media. Public\n            service delivery was monitored through performance and\n            expenditure tracking surveys. A few policies on citizen\n            participatory mechanisms were also approved. Although\n            progress has been noted in many areas, sectoral reforms may\n            take a long time to materialize and will require a\n            coordinated effort across ministries and departments. An\n            immediate challenge for Uganda is to reduce the population\n            growth rate as it poses a serious threat to\n            poverty-reduction and economic development

The reform program focuses on improving\n            basic service delivery, through efficient, and equitable use\n            of public resources, essential for improving public resource\n            allocation, and raising the productivity, and\n            cost-efficiency of public investment, and other\n            expenditures. In addition, improved governance, through\n            cross-cutting public sector reforms, such as reforms in\n            public service, public procurement, and financial management\n            will be adopted to increase transparency, and fight\n            corruption. Moreover, improved access to, and quality of\n            education, health care, and water/sanitation services will\n            enhance the effective delivery of basic services, provided\n            sector-specific constraints are tied to improvement\n            measures. However, many problems in basic service sectors\n            are beyond the mandate of a particular sector, and require\n            collaboration across agencies, and departments. Risks\n            include pervasive institutional, and human capacity\n            weaknesses; corruption, which could inhibit private sector\n            confidence, and investment, and hamper
