The main objective of the impact\n            evaluation exercise was to understand the medium and\n            long-term impacts (5 to 10 years after completion) of\n            eighteen years of lending for urban development. In\n            preparing the report, Operations Evaluation Department (OED)\n            has concentrated on four main areas of impacts: (i)\n            improvements in the urban environment; (ii) changes in urban\n            land values and markets; (iii) strengthening of\n            institutions; and (iv) scope and durability of impacts. The\n            three components of the four urban projects were evaluated:\n            the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP); the sites and\n            services program; and a city-wide improvement program. The\n            study has drawn one overriding conclusion: under conditions\n            of rapid economic development, targeted urban-sector\n            improvement programs can have a very positive impact on\n            low-income areas. Those impacts can be achieved at a low\n            cost of investment that reaps high economic rates of return.\n            The study found that the most positive impact of KIP was the\n            upgrade in the quality of life of kampung residents given by\n            improved footpaths, lighting, education and health\n            facilities, living space, and reduction of housing density.\n            In addition, the study found that there is much wider access\n            to clean and safe water, private toilets/septic tanks, and\n            less frequent flooding outside their homes. More than two\n            thirds of the respondents in project areas attributed the\n            improvements in their kampungs to KIP. The majority of the\n            respondents also suggested that today's overall\n            environmental condition in their neighborhood is better than\n            before KIP was implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Enhancing the quality of life in\n            urban Indonesia: the legacy of Kampung Improvement Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Enhancing the quality\n            of life in urban Indonesia: the legacy of Kampung\n            Improvement Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/441902/indonesia-enhancing-quality-life-urban-indonesia-legacy-kampung-improvement-program","projn":"ID-Urban Devt.
