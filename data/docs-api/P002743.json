The venture will develop\n            renewable energy resources, new job opportunities as well as\n            supplying power to isolated areas. In addition, it will\n            replace production from diesel sets, thus providing\n            substantial foreign exchange savings as well as laying the\n            basis for improved power sector coordination, tariff policy,\n            power system control and load dispatching practices. A\n            further objective of the project is to maintain and further\n            improve Tanesco's operations through support of its\n            training and management programs. Specifically, the project\n            components include: (a) construction of a water intake; a\n            headrace tunnel as well as a vertical penstock system\n            leading to an underground powerhouse; a tailrace tunnel; a\n            switchyard; and ancillary buildings. The project will also\n            include: (b) construction of a system control center at Dar\n            es Salaam; (c) rehabilitation of the existing Ubongo diesel\n            station and other power system facilities. Funds are also\n            intended for: (d) training and management programmes; and\n            finally for (e) consultancy services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Fourth Power (Mtera\n

        this Fourth Power Project.  The venture will develop\n            renewable energy resources, new job opportunities as well as\n            supplying power to isolated areas.  In addition, it will\n            replace production from diesel sets, thus providing\n            substantial foreign exchange savings as well as laying the\n            basis for improved power sector coordination, tariff policy,\n            power system control and load dispatching practices.  A\n            further objective of the project is to maintain and further\n            improve Tanesco's operations through support of its\n            training and management programs.  Specifically, the project\n            components include: (a) construction of a water intake; a\n            headrace tunnel as well as a vertical penstock system\n            leading to an underground powerhouse; a tailrace tunnel; a\n            switchyard; and ancillary buildings.  The project will also\n            include: (b) construction of a system control center at Dar\n            es Salaam; (c) rehabilitation of the existing Ubongo diesel\n            station and other power system facilities.  Funds are also\n            intended for: (d) training and management programmes; and\n            finally for (e) consultancy services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Fourth Power (Mtera\n            Hydroelectric) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Fourth Power (Mtera\n            Hydroelectric) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/06/740286/tanzania-fourth-power-mtera-hydroelectric-project","projn":"TZ-Power Iv-114683 -- P002743","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,National Governance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970718101252"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,allocation of\n            resources,Authority,balance of payments,Bank loans,Bank of\n            Tanzania,banking system,budgetary\n            allocations,COAL,commercial\n            loans,consolidation,country's balance of\n            payments,Currency\n            Units,debt,decentralization,deposits,development\n            projects,development strategy,economic activity,Economic\n            Development,Economic Rate of Return,employment,energy\n            consumption,exchange\n            rate,execution,expenditures,exploitation,exports,financial\n            difficulties,Financial RequirementS,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            production,foreign assistance,foreign exchange,foreign\n            reserves,forestry,GDP,Government borrowing,government\n            controls,Government officials,Government policy,Government\n            program,Government sector,growth rate,imports,interest\n            rate,less developed countries,macroeconomic\n            performance,mandates,marginal cost,Ministry of Finance,money\n            supply,National\n            Accounts,nationalization,Nations,oil,parastatal\n            organizations,parastatals,per capita income,per capita\n            incomes,population growth,portfolios,price increases,price\n            subsidies,producer incentives,project financing,proven\n            reserves,public administration,public investment,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,resource allocation,resource\n            mobilization,savings,social welfare,Structural\n            Adjustment,technical assistance,terms of trade,transport,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,allocation of\n            resources,Authority,balance of payments,Bank loans,Bank of\n            Tanzania,banking system,budgetary\n            allocations,COAL,commercial\n            loans,consolidation,country's balance of\n            payments,Currency\n            Units,debt,decentralization,deposits,development\n            projects,development strategy,economic activity,Economic\n            Development,Economic Rate of Return,employment,energy\n            consumption,exchange\n            rate,execution,expenditures,exploitation,exports,financial\n            difficulties,Financial RequirementS,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,food\n            production,foreign assistance,foreign exchange,foreign\n            reserves,forestry,GDP,Government borrowing,government\n            controls,Government officials,Government policy,Government\n            program,Government sector,growth rate,imports,interest\n            rate,less developed countries,macroeconomic\n            performance,mandates,marginal cost,Ministry of Finance,money\n            supply,National\n            Accounts,nationalization,Nations,oil,parastatal\n            organizations,parastatals,per capita income,per capita\n            incomes,population growth,portfolios,price increases,price\n            subsidies,producer incentives,project financing,proven\n            reserves,public administration,public investment,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,resource allocation,resource\n            mobilization,savings,social welfare,Structural\n            Adjustment,technical assistance,terms of trade,transport,wages"}},"owner":"WB Off:DaresSalaam-Eastern AFR 1 (AFCE1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P3625"},"facets":{}}}
