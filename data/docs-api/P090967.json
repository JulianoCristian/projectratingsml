Second Higher Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Higher Education Project for\n            Nepal has the following revised project development\n            objectives: (a) enhanced quality, efficiency and relevance\n            of higher education through a set of systemic reforms and\n            incentives to selected institutions; and (b) improved access\n            for academically qualified students from disadvantaged\n            groups in (i) higher education and (ii) higher secondary\n            education. In March 2011, the several significant revisions\n            in components were approved. About US$4 million from IDA\n            financing for reforms grants were reallocated to higher\n            secondary education. Other significant changes include the\n            amendment of the Financing Agreement dated April 30, 2007.\n            The overall outcome rating is 'Satisfactory'; for\n            this structured project, its outcome is assessed against\n            both its original and revised project objectives. The\n            outcome of the original project is rated 'Moderately\n            Satisfactory' due to its high relevance and efficient\n            achievement of both development objectives which met all\n            three outcome indicators at project closing, but fell short\n            in two of nine results indicators. The outcome of the\n            revised project is rated 'Highly Satisfactory' due\n            to its high relevance and the efficient achievement of most\n            targets of outcome and intermediate indicators directly\n            linked to project interventions. This project was developed\n            and implemented in a fragile country environment with\n            limited resources and connectivity but with high demand for\n            higher education from its young population. The project\n            holds many rich lessons for other low-income countries\n            facing similar issues: with appropriate recognition and\n            catalytic support, community-run institutions can outperform\n            public-funded institutions; for national development, human\n            resources are critical and access to higher education should\n            not be limited to a select few; and widespread consultations\n            with all stakeholders are important for major reforms and\n            full ownership."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal -

The changes are: the project closing date is to be\n            extended from January 15, 2014 to June 30, 2014 aligning it\n            with the International Development Association, or IDA\n            fiscal year (and also closely with the government fiscal\n            year). The extension is mainly to continue assistance to\n            financially poor students on scholarships and for research\n            scholars already supported by the project. The extension\n            will also facilitate continuity and smooth transition to a\n            new project under development. To facilitate the full and\n            optimum utilization of project resources, a final\n            reallocation of funds is proposed. The total reallocation is\n            SDR 1.775 million amongst categories of expenditure: SDR 0.6\n            million is to be reallocated to category 1A, 0.3 million\n            from category 1C, and category 5 each.
