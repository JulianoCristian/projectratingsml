The Bank assisted\n            NIOC in all aspects of project preparation, including\n            technical aspects, securing of financing, restructuring of\n            the company and management arrangements. The Bank played a\n            key role in securing the financing package. The working\n            capital requirements of US$15 million was financed by\n            commercial banks. However, due to the highly risky situation\n            of NIOC and complexity of trust and insurance arrangements\n            it took about one year to secure this financing .Major\n            lessons learned include: (i) when preparing rehabilitation\n            projects and making an initial assessment of the\n            projects' financial and economic viability, provisions\n            should be made for possible further deterioration during the\n            period between preparation and start of implementation. (ii)\n            A corollary to lesson one is that rehabilitation of a\n            neglected capital stock is not only costly but costs are\n            difficult to estimate. Therefore, when making provisions for\n            asset renewals of a deteriorated capital stock careful\n            assumptions should be applied. Preparation of such programs\n            has to start early in the project cycle because they are\n            politically sensitive and require time to be agreed upon and\n            to be implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia -

Beneficiated ore output\n            would be increased from 2.3 to 3.25 million long tons per\n            year, and infrastructure facilities would be improved and\n            equipment would be installed to reduce operating costs. The\n            project would improve the railroad to the port at Monrovia,\n            repair the St. Paul River railway bridge, and provide\n            additional mining and miscellaneous support equipment;\n            management and technical assistance to execute the project\n            and improve the Company's operations would also be\n            provided. The project would benefit about 2,000 workers\n            directly and some 16-18,000 people indirectly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - NIOC Iron Ore Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - NIOC Iron Ore\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/12/725983/liberia-nioc-iron-ore-rehabilitation-project","projn":"LR-National Iron Ore Co -- P001438","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Earth Sciences & GIS,Primary Metals,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Liberia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912544510"},"subsc":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"air,artisanal\n            gold,Beneficiation,climate,Concession\n            Areas,construction,diamonds,drilling,drills,erosion,feasibility\n            studies,high levels,Hills,housing,Iron,Iron Ore,iron ore\n            mining,lines,Marketing,mine closure,Mine Management,mine\n            site,Mine Tailings,mineral reserves,mines,mining\n            activities,mining companies,Mining Company,mining\n            concessions,mining equipment,mining operation,mining\n            production,MINING SECTOR,mountains,oil,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,payment of taxes,pellets,plant\n            operations,Plant Production,ponds,Project Management,rainy\n            season,rolling,Safety,Schools,Social Services,Steel,steel\n            industry,unemployment,water supply,West,West Africa,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"air,artisanal\n            gold,Beneficiation,climate,Concession\n            Areas,construction,diamonds,drilling,drills,erosion,feasibility\n            studies,high levels,Hills,housing,Iron,Iron Ore,iron ore\n            mining,lines,Marketing,mine closure,Mine Management,mine\n            site,Mine Tailings,mineral reserves,mines,mining\n            activities,mining companies,Mining Company,mining\n            concessions,mining equipment,mining operation,mining\n            production,MINING SECTOR,mountains,oil,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,payment of taxes,pellets,plant\n            operations,Plant Production,ponds,Project Management,rainy\n            season,rolling,Safety,Schools,Social Services,Steel,steel\n            industry,unemployment,water supply,West,West Africa,workers"}},"owner":"Country Director Groups","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"3479"},"facets":{}}}
