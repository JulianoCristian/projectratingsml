Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance is highly satisfactory. A number of key lessons,\n            both positive and negative, were learned during project\n            implementation: 1) In a rapidly changing business and\n            lending climate, slowness in loan processing could make IBRD\n            loans: (a) less competitive in a fast evolving domestic\n            lending market; and (b) less attractive to effective\n            end-users who strive for efficiency. 2) Greater flexibility\n            in project design and implementation is essential to\n            successful commercial operations. Under the project: (a) the\n            Special Accounts, intended to provide fund liquidity, were\n            not wholly made use of; (b) some Bank procedures such as\n            cattle procurement arrangements for smallholders were\n            unworkable; and (c) the rigid prescriptions in project\n            design of smallholder production models were not responsive\n            to rapidly changing market conditions and farmer demands.\n            However, the Bank showed great flexibility when it adopted\n            more appropriate cattle procurement procedures and updated\n            production models. 3) The government's strong\n            commitment to reforms and continuous support to the\n            integrated cattle breeding, production, processing and\n            marketing system have been the foundation of the project\n            design and the primary force for project implementation as\n            well as the close cooperation between government agencies at\n            various levels. 4) An effective project management\n            structure, committed project staff, and strong emphasis on\n            monitoring and evaluation contributed significantly to\n            successful project preparation and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

It will further\n            promote marketing linkages on cattle profitability,\n            integrating markets, producers, and processors into a\n            demand-oriented marketing system. The project components\n            will: 1) improve cattle breed, suitable for commercial\n            production, while preserving indigenous breeds. It will\n            strengthen the efforts of provincial governments in cattle\n            breed improvement, upgrading beef bull stations, and where\n            necessary, will import bulls for cross-breeding. Artificial\n            insemination will be complemented with new frozen-straw\n            technology, to improve the genetic system. Cattle\n            vitamin-mineral molasses blocks will be produced, through a\n            pilot plant; 2) increase cattle production, as a result of\n            the cattle breed and feed improvements, and, adequate\n            veterinary services, and animal husbandry practices. With\n            forage enhancement technologies available, sub-components\n            will include household cow-calf raising and cattle\n            fattening, and small-scale commercial feedlots; 3) support\n            cattle and beef market development, as well as upgrade\n            slaughtering/processing facilities, for quality assurance\n            participation; 4) assist the government, by strengthening\n            institutional capacity for better international\n            compatibility practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Smallholder Cattle Development

The project is designed to maximize the use of land\n            and facilities already in use for cattle production, rather\n            than acquiring new sites or facilities. Since beef cattle\n            raising does not require expensive arable land, most of the\n            land sites have been specifically selected on non-inhabited,\n            non-cultivated waste lands or on land already owned by the\n            sponsoring production units. No persons are scheduled for\n            resettlement.
