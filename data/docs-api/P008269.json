Nonetheless, lessons\n            indicate that project design should be grounded on\n            analytical work, relevant to design decisions, and should\n            include sectors that may affect implementation of the\n            project, i.e., the absence of a substantial review of the\n            construction market, capacities, or practices in Albania,\n            underestimated several major risk factors, resulting from\n            project design omissions. Furthermore, realistic\n            expectations of project outputs, and outcomes should take\n            into account major political, economic, and social changes\n            likely to occur, as well as weak capacities who may\n            undermine effective management, or delay implementation.\n            Under political instability, labor-intensive supervision\n            should be provided, to include video-conferencing, regular\n            communications with the project unit and other key players,\n            in addition to training for local Bank staff, to be able to\n            strengthen local capacities.
