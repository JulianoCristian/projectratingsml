The project was demand-driven\n            throughout Estonia, i.e., the Government, Eesti Energia,\n            municipalities and district heating (DH) companies wanted\n            and supported the project. Thus, it showed a strong level of\n            ownership by the Borrower and project beneficiaries.\n            Moreover, it came at the right time, addressing high\n            priority issues shortly after re-independence. There were a\n            number of valuable lessons: 1) The demand forecasts of the\n            project were overly-optimistic. In cities where DH is facing\n            unfair competition from alternative heating options,\n            consideration should be given to specifying areas where DH\n            is the required heating option until the factors leading to\n            the unfair competition are removed, in order to preserve DH\n            demand. Demand forecast analysis should also consider the\n            results of social assessments to help forecast\n            consumers' reactions and responses to possible tariff\n            increases and the ability to measure and regulate heat\n            consumption. 2) Appropriate tariff policies play an\n            important role in maintaining DH consumers and thus the\n            viability of DH systems. Two-tier tariff policies allow for\n            the transparent pricing of DH based on fixed and variable\n            costs and thus allow DH companies to charge for actual costs\n            of supply. 3) It is highly important to properly assess\n            risks associated with the potential for competition from\n            gas, or other alternatives, to DH."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Estonia -
