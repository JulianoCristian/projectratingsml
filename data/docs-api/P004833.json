Lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: Continuity of responsibility from project\n            preparation to execution is essential. The project was\n            prepared mainly with national level agencies but executed by\n            local authorities. Greater public information is necessary;\n            attempts were made to inform the public about the project,\n            but they did not succeed. Procurement of compatible traffic\n            signals is complicated. Traffic management, though valuable,\n            is messy and difficult to implement. The experience in Hanoi\n            and HCMC is not atypical of Bank experience. Measuring\n            outcomes of institutional strengthening/capacity building\n            remains a challenge. Government structure in Vietnam poses\n            considerable implementation challenges.

The\n            specific goals are to: a) increase the capacity and improve\n            operating conditions of major road corridors, central areas\n            and strategic intersections by introducing traffic\n            management and engineering measures; and b) strengthen the\n            institutional capacity in traffic management and traffic\n            enforcement. The project consists of two main components.\n            The first component will involve improving traffic system on\n            four main radial corridors and in two inner city areas in\n            Hanoi City. It will also improve junctions and\n            channelization and provide railway barriers at the\n            junctions. The second component will improve the traffic\n            system on four major corridors, at 14 isolated junctions and\n            within the central area in HCMC. A fully responsive area\n            traffic control system covering about 150 intersections will\n            also be implemented in central HCMC. In both components,\n            technical assistance, training, and equipment will be\n            provided for institutional strengthening."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Urban Transport Improvement
