Oil and Gas Engineering Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the proposed project\n            are: (a) improve information on country-wide oil and gas\n            reserves as basis for a rational program of field\n            development; (b) assist YPF in locating favorable geological\n            structures in the Northwestern Basin (Porcelana-Rio Seco\n            area); and (c) study the optimum development and utilization\n            of natural gas primarily to avoid waste and to determine\n            related investment requirements. The project consists of:\n            (a) 220 man-months of consultants' services to adult\n            the reserves in 44 major reservoirs; (b) about 1,000\n            line-kilometers of semi-detailed seismic surveys in a 60 km\n            x 40 km quadrangle in the Porcelana-Rio Seco area; and (c)\n            160 man-months of consultants' services to study the\n            optimum development and utilization of natural gas. The\n            project is expected to result in a number of subsequent\n            projects aimed at strengthening the productive capacity of\n            the oil and gas sector and assisting the country in\n            attaining energy self-sufficiency. The project components\n            carry on special risks except for the seismic surveys which\n            could fail to identify hydrocarbon-bearing structures or\n            generate data which do not give conclusive evidence on\n            prospects. This risk is normal for the industry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Oil and Gas Engineering Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Oil and Gas\n            Engineering
