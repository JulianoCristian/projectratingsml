The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (a) project implementation\n            and the achievement of its development objectives are\n            crucially dependent on continuity of staff on both the\n            Borrower and Bank's sides as well as the frequency of\n            Bank supervision visits and consultations; (b) the\n            Borrower's commitment to attaining project objectives\n            and meeting Loan covenants must be exercised through vesting\n            a Project Program Office (PPO) with adequate authority and\n            resources to oversee and take action as required with all\n            project entities; (c) the Bank must educate the Borrower on\n            the requirements of the legal covenants and the implication\n            of non-compliance at the time of project preparation, and\n            must play an active role in assisting the Borrower in\n            resolving problems in meeting such covenants in a timely\n            fashion; (d) the appropriate alternative may be to\n            selectively structure the physical objectives to permit more\n            direct purchases; (e) Bank must provide in a timely manner\n            relevant information on changes in sector structure and\n            financing occurring internationally and be prepared to\n            commit the required resources for technical
