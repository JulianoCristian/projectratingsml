Some lessons learned included: programmatic\n            approaches that involve multiple stages of lending require\n            iterative analysis of national priorities which can be\n            interpreted through political economy analyses. This\n            iterative analysis is especially critical in areas or\n            countries that are affected by fragility or conflict. A\n            relatively autonomous implementing agency allowing greater\n            flexibility than a line agency may be very valuable for\n            testing new participatory models but the roadmap of its\n            evolution towards sustainable institutionalization, that is\n            folding it back into a government institution, needs to be\n            planned in advance and then later, if necessary, adapted as\n            the political and economic environment evolves. Continuity\n            of community support up to a defined point of graduation -\n            that includes mechanisms for involvement of the poor and the\n            marginalized - is important for longer term sustainability\n            of participatory community development processes. Synergies\n            between the provision of financial services and\n            complementary infrastructure investments, carefully\n            designed, can offer compounded community welfare

\"Gemi Diriya\" Project\n            for Sri Lanka were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was high, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: longer\n            term continuity in development support that preserves\n            community decision-making and participatory institutions,\n            and helps them graduate, is critical for sustaining and\n            expanding local efforts. Foremost among the factors\n            contributing to the strong performance is the soundness of\n            the Project village development model with its strong buy-in\n            from the community. Experimentation during project\n            preparation is critical for reducing risks and building\n            confidence and capacity of the staff and communities to\n            scale up under the project. A relatively autonomous\n            implementing agency with flexibility is critical for testing\n            of new models, quick results, compliance to the rules and\n            maintaining political and operational independence for\n            piloting and scaling-up of the project. The challenge will\n            be to ensure the continued evolution of this role to focus\n            on institutionalizing the model, by building capacity of\n            regular Government agencies and programs, and addressing key\n            policy and administrative issues. A very hands-on top\n            management approach and high staff commitment resulted in\n            close monitoring, troubleshooting and continuous refinement\n            of activities.

and about 60\n            percent of the population lack basic services, such as\n            drinking water, sanitation, credit, markets, etc. The\n            project - known as gemi diriya - builds on a successful\n            pilot called village self-help learning initiative (VSHLI)\n            that was introduced in 2000. The objective of the 12-year\n            program (in three phases) is to enable rural communities\n            improve their livelihoods and quality of life. Some 100,000\n            households (about 500,000 people) in the poorest districts\n            of Sri Lanka have benefited from community infrastructure\n            and productive investments (drinking water, access roads,\n            and bridges, information and communications technology (ICT)\n            centers, access to credit, markets, skills, and income\n            generation).
