Some lessons learned includes: the\n            need for quick project preparation must be balanced with the\n            quality of project at entry. The project was prepared quite\n            rapidly, with only nine months from concept review to Board\n            approval. Additionally, the country situation at preparation\n            stage was still fluid, coming out of a turbulent phase of\n            its history. Agreed institutional arrangements, government\n            commitment and a viable single agency are basic\n            prerequisites for a successful project implementation. Both\n            the Bank and the government need to involve proper expertise\n            in different areas, to ensure a smooth implementation of\n            project activities. Lack of a proper Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) design raises questions on the overall\n            quality of project design. Close coordination with other\n            development partners is very important. Health sector\n            reforms are long-term and quite complex."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Montenegro - Additional Financing for the\n            Health Care System Improvement

She spent many of\n            those years working under the health care system in the\n            former Yugoslavia. Now she works at a primary care center in\n            Podgorica, Montenegro, under an entirely new kind of system.\n            She says that reform is the best thing that could have\n            happened to health care in Montenegro. Looking back at the\n            days when the government introduced the new health care\n            system, she says, \u2018at first it seemed like a huge amount of\n            work, and it was, since it is not easy to take\n            responsibility for 2000 people. That's the average\n            number of patients that a chosen doctor has.\u2019 But now, she\n            says, even though there are many of them, she alone is\n            responsible for organizing her patients' care, and that\n            makes all the difference. The new system also allows doctors\n            more control over their patients' medicines. Because\n            patients generally see only one doctor, they can't go\n            from office to office asking for more of the same\n            medications. And having one doctor in charge means that that\n            doctor can monitor medicine intake, and make sure a patient\n            doesn't take too much of any one prescription. Under\n            the old system, Montenegro lacked a national drugs policy,\n            and lax record-keeping meant that keeping track of medicines\n            and dosing was often difficult, if not impossible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"In Montenegro : making patient care healthier"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"In Montenegro : making patient\n            care healthier"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/07/24428355/montenegro-making-patient-care-healthier","topic":"Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Health Benefits m1327439 1607,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625,Health Basket Finance m1326111 2181","projn":"ME-Healthcare System Improvement Project\n            (Montenegro) -- P082223,ME-Health System Improvement Additional\n            Financing -- P114275","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Health Law,Gender and Health,Health Systems Development & Reform,Disease Control & Prevention","docty":"Working Paper","teratopic":"Gender,Law and Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Montenegro","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b082e1d03a_1_0"},"theme":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Injuries and non-communicable diseases,Health system performance,Other accountability/anti-corruption,Administrative and civil service reform,Health system performance","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"Results profile","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender,Law and Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Health Benefits m1327439 1607,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625,Health Basket Finance m1326111 2181","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"health system, insurance, choice, clinical\n            protocols, workers, doctor, patients, patient, life, nurse,\n            illness, wellness, care, health care institutions, doctors,\n            health indicators, medicine, pharmaceuticals, health care\n            reform, all, rooms, primary care, health care services,\n            health insurance, health care, drugs, health care workers,\n            health, referrals, medicines, basic health, illnesses,\n            prescriptions, basic health care, health care system, rest,\n            patient care"}},"owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
