Some lessons learned\n            included: (i) policy dialogue with the Hebei Government on\n            tariff reforms and improvement of operational efficiency at\n            early stage of project preparation. This was intended to\n            encourage incentives for resource conservation and to create\n            a more reliable income stream; (ii) as an integral part of\n            the project design substantial tariff adjustments were\n            implemented during the preparation stage and prior to\n            negotiation. In addition to that Bank and municipal\n            governments agreed upfront on a schedule for tariff\n            adjustments during the implementation of the project; and\n            (iii)

Strengthen soil\n            conservation to prevent pollution from farmland and village\n            runoff by more efficiently using chemical fertilizers and\n            pesticides, and tightening
