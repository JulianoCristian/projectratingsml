Although the project met the objectives of\n            eliminating discharge of untreated sewage, thus increasing\n            the population served by the main sewer pipes, and reducing\n            flooding, Ankara Water and Sewerage Administration's\n            (ASKI) failures, particularly, compliance with the\n            Loan's tariff provisions, hindered success.\n            Nevertheless, ASKIs management succeeded recently with\n            constructive measures, and the likelihood of improving its\n            income is predictable. The Bank's performance was\n            inadequate in project preparation, offering no viable\n            solutions to problems identified during this stage; in\n            addition, appraisal results failed to properly assess\n            ASKI's financial capabilities. The lessons learned\n            convey that, it is paramount to define clear and consistent\n            objectives, particularly upon sector changes. Early\n            understanding of these objectives, by all stakeholders, as\n            well as the causes for the borrower's problems, should\n            be emphasized. Project design should isolate the utilities\n            from inadequate political interference, and instead, enhance\n            managerial capabilities. Premature decisions on project\n            implementation could be detrimental, particularly, when\n            procurement disagreements need to be resolved. The project\n            outcome questions the merits of financial covenants, in\n            light of the authority failure, by the implementing agency,\n            to assure full compliance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
