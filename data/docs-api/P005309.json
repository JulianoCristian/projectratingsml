It will include measures: (a)\n            to ensure a competitive and stable macroeconomic\n            environment; (b) to improve the competitiveness and\n            efficiency of industry and trade; (c) to rationalize public\n            expenditure; and (d) initiate a program to protect the poor\n            during the adjustment period. It aims to strengthen the most\n            important sources of growth in the Jordanian economy, i.e.\n            the expansion and diversification of industrial output and\n            exports. The loan will support policy reforms to create a\n            more uniform, non-distortionary set of incentives across\n            different sectors in the economy by: (a) rationalizing the\n
