Some lessons learned included:\n            a community-based approach to construction, while a complex\n            undertaking, can provide a number of important benefits. The\n            community-based approach to school construction utilized\n            under the project proved to be a cost-effective and\n            effective in building the envisaged structures. This\n            approach also built the institutional and managerial\n            capacity of targeted communities throughout Togo. Applying a\n            phased approach to development activities can pay high\n            dividends in terms of its development effectiveness and\n            impact. This operation\u2019s use of a phased-approach to\n            community-based construction provided an important feedback\n            loop whereby activities, procedures and tools could be\n            refined along the course of project implementation in order\n            to improve the overall quality of structures and the process\n            in which they were built. If it is determined at appraisal\n            that a country\u2019s FM system does not confirm to the Bank\u2019s\n            minimum standards, mitigation measures must be introduced\n            and adhered to before a project can be declared effective.\n            Disbursements should only commence once these minimum FM\n            standards have been fully met. The FM system established\n            under the project was insufficient to comprehensively and\n            systematically assess transfer and execution of funds at the\n            decentralized
