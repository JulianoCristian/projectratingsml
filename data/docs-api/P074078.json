Its key objective is\n            to develop an effective, sustainable, and replicable\n            mechanism--that is fully integrated with the\n            Government's decentralization and public service reform\n            programs and capacity building goals--for strengthening the\n            skills and competencies of those responsible for service\n            delivery and management at the local government level. There\n            are four main project components. The first enhances\n            academic institutional capacity by sponsoring\n            custom-designed workshops and short-term courses, providing\n            specialized training, and develops a resource center on\n            decentralization. This component also finances an academic\n            decision-making mechanism; provides interns with exposure to\n            employment opportunities in districts; and funds project\n            support. The second component funds pilot support to local\n            universities for local government capacity building through\n            curriculum development, establishing a fund for innovative\n            excellence, and supporting a local government staff training\n            pilot and planning unit. The third component enhances\n            decentralization policy research and formulation capacity.\n            The fourth component focuses on general performance\n            monitoring and learning from the pilots by testing changes\n            in the academic environment as well as in service delivery"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Decentralized Service Delivery\n            (Makerere
