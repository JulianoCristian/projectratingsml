- Uttar Pradesh Social Forestry Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Social Forestry Project for Uttar\n            Pradesh, India achieved extraordinary success with its\n            component for plantation of trees by farmers on their\n            private land. The community plantation component, which\n            aimed to develop self-help woodlots, did not succeed due to\n            a variety of economic and sociological reasons. Overall, the\n            project started promptly and progressed on a timely basis.\n            It closed on schedule in December 1984 and the credit amount\n            was fully disbursed. There were revisions in the project\n            design, determined during the mid-term review, including the\n            dropping of the fuel-efficient stove component.\n            Sustainability is likely for Uttar Pradesh's capability\n            to handle its plantation programs and even teach others.\n            However, the Forest Department has not established a firm\n            capacity for certain qualitative aspects, including\n            institutional weaknesses resulting in poor delivery of\n            advice to farmers; distribution and marketing aspects of\n            tree production; and subsistence fuel needs of the poor and\n            urban populations. The Bank performed well. Supervisions\n            occurred fairly regularly, and a useful exchange of view\n            between mission members and forestry officials often\n            occurred. IDA showed flexibility during project\n            implementation. There were five lessons learned: (i) to the\n            extent that wood production can be handled economically on\n            private lands, Forest Departments should turn over that\n            responsibility; (ii) Forest Departments have begun to\n            experiment with new plantation approaches, a key one being\n            tree tenure schemes whereby poor farmers and landless\n            persons lease public land at nominal fees and take the\n            benefits of the trees they grow there; (iii) social forestry\n            should look toward both the supply and demand sides; (iv)\n            the social forestry experience has indicated that some\n            functions can be handled better by the private sector or\n            other organizations; and (v) the project was well\n            conceptualized and the overwhelming success of farm forestry\n            could not be anticipated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

The\n            program aims at large-scale tree plantation along roads,\n            rails and canals, on village common lands unsuitable for\n            cropping, and on degraded forest reserves in need of\n            rehabilitation. The trees would provide a much-needed source\n            of energy to the villages, raw materials to cottage\n            industries, and greater stability to the environment. The\n            ultimate objective would be to have the villagers establish\n            as soon as possible their own village forests, using\n            voluntary labor, with the assistance of state-wide forest\n            extension services, for distribution of fuelwood and other\n            products to village communities. About 48,600 ha of public\n            and village lands would be planted under the project, 45,600\n            ha of which would be carried out by the Uttar Pradesh Social\n            Forestry
