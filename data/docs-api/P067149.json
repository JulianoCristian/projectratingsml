Some lessons learned included: the challenges\n            of developing an information technology (IT) system,\n            particularly one involving two agencies, should be taken\n            into account during project design and when assessing\n            project risks. While the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)\n            envisaged a relatively simple IT system for sharing\n            information, the implementing agencies opted for a\n            comprehensive, and more complex, joint information system.\n            It took some time for the implementing agencies to fully\n            understand and agree on this activity, with the resultant\n            lost time. This has been the pattern throughout the region\n            with land administration IT systems, so Croatia was not\n            alone is falling behind schedule. The development of\n            software also suffered from other common problems the\n            successful bidder's failure to recognize the complexity\n            of the task and the contractor's fielding of\n            under-qualified staff. This resulted in delays and the\n            requests for extension. The complexity of such IT systems is\n            both a key to success and institutional reforms, but also\n            demanding in terms of implementation, management, resource\n            allocation and procurement support. This is the case in\n            many, if not all, land administration projects. Some\n            important lessons in terms of project design, realistic\n            implementation schedules, and costs against\n            benefits/development outcome deserve to be highlighted. The\n            project successfully achieved major institutional reform\n            through a process oriented investment project. However the\n            time and costs were significant, including a 21 month\n            extension to complete the IT system, a key part of the\n            reform. Such process oriented investment projects can\n            implement real institutional and system-wide reform if the\n            counterparts are willing, but takes time, often longer than\n            the typical Bank project timeframe. However, if Bank\n            management and the client are willing, the payoff is\n            substantial and highly sustainable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Real Property Registration and\n
