to tied demand with investments\n            consistent with government's poverty\n            policies/strategies and HDI-based poverty status; 3) CDD\n            mechanisms can improve the quality/targeting of non-project\n            resources while leveraging complementary funding and\n            intensifying poverty reduction efforts; 4) Political, legal\n            and bureaucratic impediments to implementation require\n            patient, skilled mitigation by the project supervision team;\n            5) Indicative annual budgets for Municipal Councils improve\n            planning and build confidence in the program; 6) Systematic\n            impact evaluation remains elusive; and 7) CDD can\n            effectively target poor rural
