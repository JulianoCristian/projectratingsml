Some lessons learned included:\n            transfrontier cooperation in biodiversity conservation can\n            be achieved through parallel implementation that takes into\n            account the uniqueness of the countries involved, while\n            maintaining synergies for cross-learning and collaboration.\n            Such a design allows sovereign decision making and\n            sufficient freedom to choose specific implementation speed\n            and processes, while generating the necessary level of\n            national ownership. While the transfrontier cooperation was\n            fully accomplished with significant transfer of knowledge\n            from the advanced conservation and tourism experiences in\n            South Africa, Lesotho was able to deliver on its own\n            achievements. This appears a particularly suitable model in\n            the context of countries that differ in size and development\n            status. In countries with high local capacity it is of\n            particular importance to closely involve local institutions\n            in project design and detailed preparation. In Republic of\n            South Africa (RSA) the local capacity was high and many\n            project design concepts evolved and have been developed\n            during project implementation by the local institutions and\n            implementers (e.g. PES (Payment for Eco-services schemes) or\n            stewardship mechanisms), while or original design concepts\n            proved inappropriate for the local situation (e.g. tourism\n            development or conservancies). A well prepared logical\n            framework should be the backbone of project design and\n            should be fully agreed prior to project implementation. Such\n            framework needs to clearly show the linkages between\n            components and their outcomes with the overall environment\n            objective. Objective, indicators and targets need to be\n            realistic, helpful for management and take into account the\n            time-frame of project implementation. A baseline not only\n            helps to measure success, but also disciplines the designers\n            to pay attention to realistic and measurable indicators.\n            Frequent changes in task management during project design\n            and implementation can cause serious disruption, when task\n            managers are leaving without finishing important milestone\n            tasks. Examples under this project were the finalization and\n            agreement on the logical framework at the design stage, the\n            completion of the restructuring of the project at mid-term\n            or finishing the complex and time consuming design and\n            procurement process of the environmental centre at the later\n            stage of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"South Africa - Maloti-Drakensberg\n            Transfrontier Conservation and Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"South Africa - Maloti-Drakensberg\n

Conservation\n            planning at the landscape level will be designed to\n            facilitate bilateral involvement, and, a participatory\n            bio-diversity monitoring system will ensure cross-boundary\n            conservation, supplementing resources of the nature\n            conservation agencies, to ensure sound planning, and\n            actions; 3) ensure protected area

of existing protected areas, focusing on\n            the control of alien invading plant species, and supporting\n            through incremental costs, the rehabilitation of management\n            roads, improvement of flora and fauna conservation,\n            prioritizing on endangered species; 5) manage conservation\n            of planned protected areas, following strategies as devised\n            under component 4, prioritizing on the issue of overgrazing,\n            and loss of wetlands; 6) involve community participation,\n            emphasizing on targeted training in conservation,\n            nature-based tourism, craft production, etc.; 7) develop\n            nature-based tourism, emphasizing on community-focused\n            capacity building, with the private
