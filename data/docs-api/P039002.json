Lessons of experience are\n            suggested as follows. During implementation, it is important\n            to maintain the balance between the construction of\n            infrastructure, and institutional strengthening in\n            accordance with priorities established in the project\n            design. Notwithstanding, in extraordinary circumstances,\n            such as following a major interruption in implementation,\n            substantial revisions or adjustments to the project\n            components may be needed. This project provides a good\n            example of how new demand projections, and corresponding\n            changes in project design can be called upon, under\n            drastically changing conditions, through implementation of a\n            careful review and appropriate revisions. In this case, it\n            should have taken place around 1995 (after the war) when the\n            project was re-launched for final implementation.\n            Furthermore, the implementation plan for reducing\n            unaccounted water, including detailed annual targets, needs\n            to be specified in the project preparation documents. Had\n            this plan been better designed with detailed annual targets,\n            its implementation and supervision would have been less\n            disrupted by the difficult wartime circumstances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -

Lessons convey the need\n            for attention in forecasting water sales during major\n            macroeconomic, and structural reforms, because the\n            elasticity of demand may trigger unexpected household\n            consumption, and similarly, industrial restructuring will\n            cause variations on the industrial, and commercial demand\n            for water. And, it is re-emphasized that a successful\n            program for reduction of unaccounted-for-water, requires\n            strong Government commitments, well defined project design,\n            providing a supportive program of action. However, greater\n            progress could have been possible, had the Borrower made\n            full use of the technical assistance possibilities under the\n            project. While the Bank's supervision was rated\n            outstanding by the Quality Assurance Group, it could have\n            been further beneficial, if during supervision, the\n            appropriate arrangements for monitoring progress, and\n            evaluating the impacts of the sewerage components were in\n            place, for sewerage was an integral part of the project,\n            irrespective of the fact that such components, were not\n            financed by the loan, and, it is thus suggested the Bank\n            should focus on the overall objectives of the project during\n            implementation. Finally, in the presence of highly qualified\n            technical staff, as is the case of the Butoniga Water Works\n            (BWW), the Bank should be particularly careful in supporting\n            a turn-key contract, rather a separate contract design would\n            have further benefited BWW, and, eliminated controversial\n            delays over design, and equipment selection."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -
