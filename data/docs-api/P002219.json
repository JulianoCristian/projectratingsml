Some lessons learned included: project design\n            should be kept simple, and tailored to the borrower's\n            absorptive and implementation capacity. In this regard,\n            preparation should be accompanied by intensive assessment of\n            the fiscal and institutional context. Borrower ownership and\n            commitment is essential and should be continuously nurtured.\n            Participation and empowerment of key stakeholders should be\n            secured at various stages in the project cycle - design,\n            preparation implementation, and evaluation.
