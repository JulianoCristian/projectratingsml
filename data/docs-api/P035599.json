Lessons convey\n            that operations with an integrated approach, supporting a\n            reform program, may be somewhat ambitious, with complex\n            implementation requirements. Thus, implementation of\n            distinct phases of separate sub-sector reforms, each\n            targeting its own set of priorities, is a more realistic\n            approach to attain success, particularly under technical\n            assistance lending. It is doubtful that without the added\n            leverage of the structural adjustment program, and the\n            railway concession to the Transport Sector Project, this\n            operation would have achieved satisfactory results, and,\n            furthermore, although the joint macro-micro approach proved\n            effective, it is difficult to draw a line between the\n            projects. The project proved that the budgetary, and social\n            impact of privatization, including severance payments,\n            should be addressed during project preparation, to set the\n            pace for credible solutions. In light of the Bank's\n            continuing decentralization efforts, the delegation of\n            project management to the field need to be reviewed, for\n            although positive overall, local pressures may force issues\n            of particular local interest. It is suggested that, due to\n            the political sensitivity to some reforms, such as the air\n            transport reform, same could be more effectively discussed\n            within a regional reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Transport Sector Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Transport Sector\n            Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/02/728853/cameroon-transport-sector-technical-assistance-project","projn":"CM-Trnspt Sector T.
