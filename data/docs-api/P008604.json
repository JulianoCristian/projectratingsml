The pace of implementation was negatively\n            impacted by the frequent change of administrations.  Factors\n            generally subject to implementing agency control included:\n            insufficient use of Bank loan fund; financial\n            irregularities; implementation delays; misprocurement; lack\n            of cooperation of the various distribution companies; lack\n            of knowledge on prices of equipment; and difficulty in\n            coordinating the network outages.  Lessons learned included:\n            A) In similar projects in the future, the Bank should insist\n            on the appointment of a strong, cross-cutting Project\n            Manager from the outset.  B) State-owned companies need to\n            be alert and ready to take appropriate measures to prevent\n            financial irregularities. C) Experience with different\n            methods of implementation, including turn key, allow the\n            borrower to select whatever method is appropriate for the\n            particular location.
