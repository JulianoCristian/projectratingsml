Some lessons learned includes: security of\n            forest land tenure is an important pre requisite for\n            investments in tree planting; large and complex Bank\n            supported forestry projects can be successful when\n            implemented by sound and disciplined institutions which have\n            developed strong partnerships between national and local\n

Negative\n            environmental and social impacts and their mitigations are\n            addressed. The risk of serious social risks will be\n            minimized by setting up conflict resolution and appeal\n            mechanisms; and establishing principles and procedures for\n            awarding fair compensation for involuntary loss of land.
