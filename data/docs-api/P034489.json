Its sustainability is\n            likely, and the institutional development impact is\n            substantial. Lessons drawn from the project indicate that,\n            in light of the time involved for a concessioning process to\n            be completed, restructuring railways - without long-term\n            investments - can still produce considerable interim,\n            economic benefits, as shown by the successful results of the\n            Malawi Railways, namely, reductions in operating costs,\n            easing the government's financial support, with\n            improved accountability by the newly incorporated railways,\n            and lake service companies. Despite these benefits,\n            improvements in the operational performance were slow, and\n            the targeted international traffic did not materialize,\n            apparently due to the parastatal framework which hinders\n            staff motivation, and commitment. Privatization thus,\n            appears essential to operate financial, self-sustaining\n            entities, but the need for surplus staff to retire/retrench,\n            regardless of its high political, and social cost, remain\n            paramount. The concessioning experience elsewhere, suggests\n            that investments by parastatals, are rarely valued by\n            potential bidders, thus investments should be technically,\n            and financially evaluated, and if possible, prior to\n            concessioning, long-lived investments be avoided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -

Railways Restructuring Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The primary objective of the Railways\n            Restructuring Project (RRP) is to contribute to\n            Malawi's economic growth through: revitalizing the much\n            shorter, less expensive, but poorly-operated Nacala rail\n            route and increasing its share of Malawi's overseas\n            traffic, thus, reducing the landed cost of exports/imports\n            and enhancing Malawi's competitive advantage; and\n            restructuring, commercialization and eventual privatization\n            of Railways and Lake Services, enabling them to operate more\n            efficiently and without depending on government subsidies,\n            thus, reducing the drain on the national economy. The\n            project comprises four components: 1) a restructuring\n            component to be implemented by Malawi Railways (MR) includes\n            the setting up of new railway and lake services companies to\n            be called the Malawi Railways (1994) Limited (MR(M)) and the\n            Malawi Lake Services Limited (MLS) respectively,\n            transferring of assets and staff to the new companies, and\n            gradual downsizing and final closure of the existing MR; 2)\n            revitalization component, to be implemented by MR (M),\n            includes commercialization of rail operations, eventual\n            privatization of MR (M), extension of the services of the\n            marketing and transit facilitation experts to Caminhos de\n            Ferro de Mocambique (North) (CFM(N)) (N) to improve\n            performance of the whole Nacala rail route, and setting up\n            of institutional mechanisms for effective coordination with\n            CFM (N); 3) Lake Services component to be implemented by MLS\n            includes commercialization of its operations and eventual\n            privatization of MLS's core activities; and 4)\n            Transport Policy component includes developing a transport\n            policy that would provide a framework for efficient\n            operations with particular emphasis on restructuring and\n            privatization of transport parastatals, and enhancing\n            institutional capacity for analyzing the performance of the\n            transport sector and providing adequate response."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -
