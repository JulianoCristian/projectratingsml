Both Bank\n            and Borrower performance are considered highly satisfactory\n            as well. The CIP's experience and lessons are generally\n            consistent with those of other recent emergency import\n            components in transition countries. Findings and lessons\n            learned are: (a) A positive-list emergency import project\n            can be an effective tool for addressing urgent production\n            bottlenecks while simultaneously supporting a reform\n            process, provided that there is built-in project flexibility\n            and substantial Government commitment and proactive Bank\n            supervision to respond quickly to the changing needs. (b)\n            Timeliness is paramount. The Bank's responsiveness to\n            Albania's needs in 1992 and 1993 won it considerable\n            credibility with the Government and resulted in a close and\n            productive Government-Bank relationship over those years. To\n            some extent, there are tradeoffs between timeliness and\n            urgency on the one hand and thorough preparation and\n            meticulous implementation on the other. (c) Considering that\n            Albania was going through a difficult transition and that\n            income and demand were limited, the project's design\n            should have taken into consideration that imports to the\n            private sector may not sell rapidly at full CIF landed\n            prices. Auctions might have been a more appropriate way to\n            distribute goods quickly, while simultaneously building a\n            private suppliers network. (d) Emergency import projects\n            like all other projects require the establishment of\n            accounting and management information systems (MIS). A MIS\n            system for the CIP would have resulted in better tracking of\n            local project costs and of the distribution of goods to end\n            users. (e) Unplanned but important project benefits included\n            (1) knowledge and skills transfer (especially procurement);\n            and (2) development of sectoral dialogues, leading to a\n            strengthening of the subsequent loan portfolio. (f) An\n            import project in a new borrower country requires early\n            attention to procurement, including hands-on training and\n            support by Bank procurement staff and the appointment of\n            project procurement advisers. This early emphasis on\n            economic and efficient procurement discipline can set the\n            stage for the development of a transparent procurement\n            environment in the country. (g) Higher than average\n            resources are needed when working with new borrowers,\n            especially in transition countries. Bank effort is required\n            to assist the Government with specific implementation\n            issues, as well as to redesign project components in the\n            face of emerging realities. The CIP was not only processed\n            and approved on a fast-track basis, but continued to be\n            closely supervised during implementation, which was a factor\n            in its success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

The project will provide critical\n            goods and materials to enable vital sectors of the economy\n            to continue to operate. It will finance the priority import\n            requirements of the agriculture and power sectors. The\n            agriculture component provides urgent inputs for crop and\n            poultry/egg production in 1992/93; spare parts for\n            agricultural mechanization and irrigation. The power\n            component will provide materials and equipment for: repairs\n            of generating plants; rehabilitation of the transmission\n            system; improvements in the dispatching/monitoring system;\n            and rehabilitation of the distribution network in Tirana,\n            Shkoder, and Durres. The transport component includes spare\n            parts, batteries and tires for trucks; spare parts for the\n            port at Durres, and telecommunications systems for the\n            railways. Finally, under the general administration\n            component, the project will finance imports of office\n            equipment for the public entities involved in project
