Some lessons learned included: a regional\n            project by its very nature is time consuming in all phases\n            of the project cycle, and the water sector brings additional\n            complexity because of the numerous often fragmented\n            responsibilities for government entities at different\n            levels. It is often difficult and time consuming to reach\n            consensus and move forward. Thus, future design of regional\n            water and Groundwater (GW) projects should consider a more\n            extended period for preparation and implementation than is\n            normal for a single country project. A regional project has\n            to continuously engage national line-agency counterparts and\n            demonstrate the relevance of the project objectives and\n            outcomes to their work programs and institutional mandates\n            in order to garner active engagement and support during\n            project implementation. The Guarani Project was able to\n            demonstrate its importance starting from the beginning that\n            served it well during project implementation. Once the\n            riparian countries of the Guarani aquifer realized the\n            importance of the project's outputs to their work, they\n            shared scientific and technical information and actively\n            participated in developing management approaches. In the\n            Guarani outcropping areas, where the major use is\n            concentrated, sustainable utilization of the resource is\n            possible due to a large amount of natural recharge. However,\n            in confined areas of the Guarani, recharge is low, but\n            storage is very high. Although if well managed the water in\n            these confined areas could last for hundreds or even\n            thousands of years, true sustainable utilization may not be\n            possible (for lack of recharge) and thus the exploitation in\n            these areas after a certain low limit, will need to be\n            treated as mining."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and Caribbean Region -\n            Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development of the\n            Guarani Aquifer System Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latin America and Caribbean\n            Region -
