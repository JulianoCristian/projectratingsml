dialogue while averting the\n            collapse of the power sector due to natural or other crises;\n            2) the Bank should consider developing a methodology for\n            estimating

to assist the Government implement its\n            emergency measures to avert a prolonged period of severe\n            load-shedding, which would cripple economic activities, and\n            hinder the delivery of social services. The project will\n            provide funds to cover the incremental power supply costs,\n            attributable to the 2003 drought. Specifically, the\n            International Development Association's (IDA) financial\n            contribution, will cover the incremental costs of fuel for\n            running the Ubungo Power Plant on Jet A1 fuel through July\n            2004, when the Plant will be commissioned to operate on\n            indigenous gas, and, the costs due to the purchase of\n            electricity produced from the Independent Power Tanzania\n            Ltd. (IPTL) Power Plant, operating on heavy fuel oil,\n            through February 2005. Given the circumstances, the project\n            will assist in avoiding severe load-shedding, and the\n            consequent negative impact on the overall economy, and\n            delivery of social services. This will benefit not only\n            electricity customers, but also those employed in the formal\n            and informal services, who would otherwise, lose jobs and\n            income due to the economic impact of significant power\n            supply interruptions. Moreover, the project will help\n            maintain the current momentum of the power sector reform\n            program. Both severe load-shedding, and massive tariff\n            increases (i.e., a surcharge to fully cover all additional\n            thermal generation costs) could jeopardize the sector reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -
