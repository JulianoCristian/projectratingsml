The following are lessons learned from this\n            project: 1) Project design: a) Over ambitious project\n            objectives are likely to do more harm than good, as there is\n            the risk of none achieving them or, in the worst case, to\n            leave unfinished investments yielding little or no economic\n            return; b) multiple project objectives are likely to end-up\n            in failure to achieve them if there is not an adequate\n            prioritization or if there are no adequate criteria to\n            resolve potential conflicts among objectives; and c) lending\n            large amounts of money to an utility that historically has\n            been unable to generate funds for investments and to service\n            its debts is a major risk for the borrowing country, as it\n            is likely that the government end-up servicing the debt. 2)\n            Technical assistance: a) technical assistance is not an\n            effective method to mitigate project risks related to\n            adverse public opinion and political opposition to reform;\n            and b) technical assistance is not an effective method to\n            turn around a utility which for years had been inefficient\n            and financially weak. 3) Bank's knowledge: a) ignoring\n            evidence available in the Bank in documents like the Country\n            Assistance Strategies and Public Expenditure Reviews\n            regarding the viability of sector reform is likely to result\n            in poor quality projects; and b) paying pro-forma attention\n            to the lessons in evaluation reports by the Operations\n            Evaluation Department is likely to result in poor quality\n            projects. 4) Water supply markets: the Paraguayan government\n            decision to enter into agreements with currently  informal\n            service providers is an approach which could help in\n            accelerating the provision of water and sanitation services\n            to population without adequate service."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Asuncion Sewerage Project (Later\n            Reform

The\n            third set of claims alleges that the families affected by\n            the raising of the reservoir level were not all identified.\n            The fourth set of claims alleges that the resettlement and\n            income restoration programs are not being properly\n            implemented.

The Yacyreta Project extends more than two decades,\n            and, its social and environmental parts are partly financed\n            under both the Argentina, and Paraguay loans. This report\n            concludes the Panel's investigation into allegations in\n            the Request for Inspection submitted in May 2002. It\n            adresses Bank environmental compliance issues raised by the\n            complaint: the adequacy of environmental assessments, the\n            relationship between the level of the reservoir and urban\n            flooding, and ground water levels, the water-related health\n            problems, and, the location and design of the sewage\n            treatment plant. It finds the environmental screening\n            process was appropriate. However, on reviewing the\n            environmental assessments and resettlement plans, it was\n            found these to be very inadequate, not in compliance with\n            the Bank's Operational Directive OD 4.01. It considers\n            the biophysical environment, and urban and peri-urban\n            environments, finding that both environmental and social\n            assessments should have anticipated the induced effects\n            associated with the Project, that construction of the\n            Yacyreta dam has a negligible effect on the water level of\n            the Parana river at Encarnacion, especially in times of\n            flood, that the reservoir is frequently operated under\n            excessive water production levels, and that this is not\n            consistent with neither the loan agreement, nor the Third\n            Owners Agreement, as amended. Moreover, the Panel confirms\n            that flooding makes the drinking water unsafe, however, it\n            finds that the alleged causal relationship between the level\n            of the Yacyreta reservoir, and pollution of wells and\n            flooding of latrines is not correct, while the existence of\n            the monitoring program was verified, reviewed, and no\n            evidence contradicting the findings was found, and, confirms\n            that the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay\n            adequately monitors the incidence of both disease, and\n            disease vectors. Importantly, the Panel finds that\n            responsibility for the cost of connection to the sewer\n            system may become a significant source of conflict, and\n            needs urgent attention of Bank Management. The Panel finds\n            persuasive evidence of erroneous omissions on the number of\n            people present at the 1990 census, thus making them\n            ineligible for Project compensation and resettlement\n            benefits, and, that this sole basis for restoration of\n            income does not satisfy OD 4.30's requirement for many\n            affected people, and, that grievance mechanisms were neither\n            in compliance with the directive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
