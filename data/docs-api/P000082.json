The project\n            was aimed at reversing the decline of cotton production in\n            the Zou province through the supply of inputs (fertilizers\n            and insecticides mainly), strengthening agricultural\n            services and facilitating the processing and marketing of\n            cotton. Over a period of five years, the project aimed at\n            reaching 38,000 families (about half the population of the\n            Zou province) and to increase annual production of cotton by\n            5,700 metric tons. Parallel improvements in food crop\n            production were expected to occur not only through residual\n            effects arising from fertilizers applied to cotton, but also\n            through improved genetic material and better farming\n            methods, including greater use of animal traction. Annual\n            targets of food crop increase were 5,200 tons of maize,\n            4,000 tons of groundnut, 3,300 tons of cowpeas and 400 tons\n            of paddy.

incomes and to increase production of export and\n            food crops through strengthening and support of\n            institutions, integrated with applied research, seed\n            production, extension, cooperative training, and social\n            services. The project will be implemented over a\n            five-and-one-half year period. It is expected to reach some\n            38,000 farm families (about 50% of the Province's\n            total), and to generate an incremental production of 5,700 t\n            of cotton, 5,200 t of maize, 4,000 t of groundnuts, 3,300 t\n            of cowpeas, 400 t of paddy, and 200 t of tobacco. The\n            project's principal quantifiable benefit would derive\n            from the incremental production of cotton, food crops and\n            livestock products. Unquantifiable benefits include better\n            financial management of Government institutions, enhancement\n            of their capability to plan and implement development\n            activities, and the establishment of a firm basis for\n            adaptive food crop and cotton research, and for seed production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Zou Province Rural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Zou Province Rural\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/11/725666/benin-zou-province-rural-development-project","projn":"BJ-Rural Devt III (Zou) -- P000082","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912590665"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            investment,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agricultural Training,Agriculture,animal\n            health,animals,beans,capita incomes,cash\n            crops,cassava,cattle,cereals,certain\n            extent,coconut,coffee,Cooperatives,Cotton,cotton,cotton\n            cultivation,Cotton Marketing,cotton prices,Cotton\n            production,cotton sector,cowpeas,Crop,Crop Development,crop\n            prices,Crop Processing,crop production,crop\n            varieties,Cultivation,dairy products,development\n            projects,development strategy,diseases,double cropping,dry\n            season,Economic Analysis,economic competition,economic\n            policies,Economic Rate of Return,Equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,export crops,exports,Extension,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,Farming,Farms,fertilizer,fertilizer\n            use,fertilizers,Fisheries,Food Crops,food\n            production,foodcrops,forestry,forests,fruits,GDP,GDP per\n            capita,geomorphology,Ginneries,goats,grain,grain\n            storage,groundnut,groundnut\n            production,groundnuts,groundnuts,groundwater,growth\n            rate,Housing,husbandry,hybrid seed,IFAD,Imports,income,input\n            prices,input use,integrated rural\n            development,irrigation,labor force,land development,legumes,Livestock,livestock,"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            investment,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agricultural Training,Agriculture,animal\n            health,animals,beans,capita incomes,cash\n            crops,cassava,cattle,cereals,certain\n            extent,coconut,coffee,Cooperatives,Cotton,cotton,cotton\n            cultivation,Cotton Marketing,cotton prices,Cotton\n            production,cotton sector,cowpeas,Crop,Crop Development,crop\n            prices,Crop Processing,crop production,crop\n            varieties,Cultivation,dairy products,development\n            projects,development strategy,diseases,double cropping,dry\n            season,Economic Analysis,economic competition,economic\n            policies,Economic Rate of Return,Equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,export crops,exports,Extension,extension\n            services,Farm,farmer,Farming,Farms,fertilizer,fertilizer\n            use,fertilizers,Fisheries,Food Crops,food\n            production,foodcrops,forestry,forests,fruits,GDP,GDP per\n            capita,geomorphology,Ginneries,goats,grain,grain\n            storage,groundnut,groundnut\n            production,groundnuts,groundnuts,groundwater,growth\n            rate,Housing,husbandry,hybrid seed,IFAD,Imports,income,input\n            prices,input use,integrated rural\n            development,irrigation,labor force,land development,legumes,Livestock,livestock,"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"3968"},"facets":{}}}
