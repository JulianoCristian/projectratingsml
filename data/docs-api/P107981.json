Some lessons learned\n            included: this project has also demonstrated the need for\n            meaningful consultations with all stakeholders at all times.\n            Simply relying on the power and influence of the government\n            to force the participation of an unwilling participant did\n            not work in this case. On the other hand, continuous and\n            regular consultations at every step of the project, and\n            listening carefully to the needs of the participants, could\n            have been more effective in ensuring greater commitment and\n            ownership from the stakeholders. Shifting course during\n            project implementation, when a critical event that\n            significantly impacts project completion is triggered, is an\n            essential element of good project management. In this\n            project it seems that the project team never attempted to\n            change course during the six years of the project period.\n            Often there are different paths that can be taken to achieve\n            the same goal and this project might have had a more\n            successful end if the project had been restructured when it\n            was facing challenges. Another key lesson is the importance\n            of defining the project development objective and to link it\n            closely with a results framework (outcome and output\n            indicators) that allows accurate measurement of progress\n            towards achieving the project goal. Some project components\n            were not adequately linked to the PDO or the performance\n            indicators. As a result, it was difficult for the project\n            team to accurately assess project achievements and ratings\n            (even though these components were successfully implemented)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - Mobile Phone Banking Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Maldives - Mobile Phone Banking

Banking Project in the Maldives is to significantly increase\n            the use of banking system transactions for effecting or\n            receiving payments for labor, goods and services nationwide\n            through the implementation of a national inter-operable\n            payments system that facilitates access to financial\n            services and allows users access to their bank account using\n            any mobile phone operator and cashing through any banking\n            agent. The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2013. The extension is\n            necessary to overcome implementation delays due to the\n            political turmoil in the country over the past few years,\n            which hampered the decision making process. The extension\n            will allow the completion of critical components of the\n            mobile payment system and of the automated clearing house,\n            as well as further capacity building for the Maldives\n            Monetary Authority (MMA) staff and implementation support to\n            ensure smooth functioning of the system after its launch.\n            Once implemented, the project will also provide learning\n            experience for the Bank to replicate in other similar\n            geographically challenged countries. In order to achieve the\n            completion of activities and supporting the implementation\n            during the initial implementation stage, an 18 month\n            extension is requested to the closing date. The recipient\n            has an action plan to implement the project during the\n            extension of the project.

The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2012 until December 31, 2013. The extension is\n            necessary to overcome implementation delays due to the\n            political turmoil in the country over the past few years,\n            which hampered the decision making process. The extension\n            will allow the completion of critical components of the\n            mobile payment system and of the automated clearing house,\n            as well as further capacity building for the Maldives\n            Monetary Authority (MMA) staff and implementation support to\n            ensure smooth functioning of the system after its launch.\n            Once implemented, the project will also provide learning\n            experience for the Bank to replicate in other similar\n            geographically challenged countries.
