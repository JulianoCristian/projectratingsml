Ratings for the Strengthening Institutions\n            Development Policy Grant Project for Afghanistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Development\n            Policy Operations (DPO) can achieve important public\n            administration and financial management reforms in high-risk\n            environments with strong government ownership and flexible\n            implementation. Emergency consultant support in the short\n            and medium-term can usefully supplement the skill base in\n            Governments where progress in institution and capacity\n            building is bound to be a slow and time-consuming process.\n            These skilled personnel can help adopt structures,\n            processes, systems, laws, and regulations to enable reforms\n            in, inter alia, pay and grading, administrative reform\n            oversight, human resources monitoring, tax administration,\n            financial management, procurement, and audit. However,\n            ensuring the transition to a more normal administrative\n            structure is necessary for sustainability. It is crucial to\n            empower senior officials from Government to determine and\n            direct administrative reform, public financial management\n            and other institutional processes that make sense locally\n            and that can promote broad based consensus inclusive of key\n            political groups, while being sufficiently robust to deal\n            with rapid social and economic change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - First, Second, and Third\n            Programmatic Support for Institution Building Project and\n            Strengthening

Both the Bank and the borrower\n            performances were satisfactory. The main lessons learned\n            from these projects are: 1) For the PSIB II and III, the\n            Bank team made good use of both facets of the development\n            policy instrument. 2) The PSIB\u0092s experience emphasized the\n            opportunity to maximize synergies with other Bank\n            instruments and other donor programs. 3) It is vital to\n            carefully assess the political economy in each reform area\n            as well as ground development policy lending in high quality\n            AAA work. 4) The PSIB series succeeded in strengthening\n            institution building and important parts of the legal\n            regulatory framework, but capacity development will be a\n            long term undertaking. 5) The outcomes for the PSIB
