Specific lessons indicate\n            that the experience of demand-driven training programs was\n            successful, since requests for training originated from\n            micro-enterprises, and responsive, skills upgrading programs\n            provided an improved productivity among those enterprises.\n            Regrettably, the Bank's operational procedures\n            precluded the full disbursement of funds over the six-year\n            period, to the training support fund, an issue which needs\n            to be reviewed, and simplified. Moreover, although some\n            training financing sources exist, diversification of\n            financing methods, and alternatives for private financing\n            are still needed. It is further suggested that selection of\n            construction firms should follow a rigorous process, to\n            avoid unnecessary delays, as proven by the difficulties\n            encountered in this project, due to the firm's\n            difficulties with liquidity in foreign currency. General\n            lessons reinforce that institutional, and policy reforms\n            follow a political process, and it is this\n            process-time-frame which should be precisely estimated, to\n            avoid falling behind schedule, due to possible delayed\n            adoption of policy statutes. Additionally, performance\n            indicators should be specified, in measurable terms, before\n            implementation; similarly, impact assessment of training\n            programs should be built into the implementation plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania -

However, attempts to\n            correct deficiencies in vocational training and make\n            training programs more flexible and responsive to labor\n            market demands were largely unsuccessful. In technical\n            education, following the outflow of skilled foreign workers\n            in the early 1990s and a planned sharp reduction of French\n            technical assistance serving as instructors, qualitative and\n            staffing problems require urgent attention. The principal\n            objectives of the project are to help establish a coherent\n            system of technical education and vocational training\n            (TEVT), staffed largely by national instructors, efficient\n            and of good quality, and responsive to labor market demands.\n            To this end,  the project supports a number of institutional\n            measures to: (a) establish a common management structure for\n            the TEVT system; (b) increase the financial and operational\n            autonomy of TEVT institutions; and (c) promote the\n            participation of employers in operating and financing\n            technical and vocational training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Technical Education and\n            Vocational Training Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritania - Technical Education\n            and Vocational Training Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/734632/mauritania-technical-education-vocational-training-support-project","projn":"MR-Technical/Vocational -- P001872","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Mauritania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961004130744"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Vocational training,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accreditation,addition,basic\n            education,courses,curricula,Development Program,economic\n            development,Economic growth,education policies,education\n            programs,education projects,Education Sector,education\n            system,Employment,employment\n            opportunities,enrollment,entrance\n            requirements,expenditures,formal education,general secondary\n            education,Higher Technical Education,Human\n            Resources,institutional structure,instructors,Labor\n            Force,Labor Market,literacy,literacy training,monitoring\n            system,National Education,new entrants,occupations,primary\n            education,primary school,primary school leavers,religious\n            schools,scholarships,school leavers,schools,secondary\n            education,secondary level,secondary school graduates,skilled\n            workers,Social Development,Sports,Teacher,Teacher\n            Training,teachers,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            skills,technical assistance,Technical Education,Technical\n            Teacher Training,Technical\n            Training,trainees,training,training activities,training\n            centers,training facilities,training institutions,training\n            programs,university graduates,urban areas,vocational\n            education,vocational skills,Vocational Training,Workers,Youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"accreditation,addition,basic\n            education,courses,curricula,Development Program,economic\n            development,Economic growth,education policies,education\n            programs,education projects,Education Sector,education\n            system,Employment,employment\n            opportunities,enrollment,entrance\n            requirements,expenditures,formal education,general secondary\n            education,Higher Technical Education,Human\n            Resources,institutional structure,instructors,Labor\n            Force,Labor Market,literacy,literacy training,monitoring\n            system,National Education,new entrants,occupations,primary\n            education,primary school,primary school leavers,religious\n            schools,scholarships,school leavers,schools,secondary\n            education,secondary level,secondary school graduates,skilled\n            workers,Social Development,Sports,Teacher,Teacher\n            Training,teachers,teaching,teaching materials,teaching\n            skills,technical assistance,Technical Education,Technical\n            Teacher Training,Technical\n            Training,trainees,training,training activities,training\n            centers,training facilities,training institutions,training\n            programs,university graduates,urban areas,vocational\n            education,vocational skills,Vocational Training,Workers,Youth"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF035738-MAURITANIA - GENERAL EDUCATION","repnb":"11806"},"facets":{}}}
