Ratings for the\n            Second Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Third Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project in Mexico were as follows: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include: the expected outcomes and scope of an\n            operation should be subject to several reality checks at\n            appraisal. An important one is to ensure that essential\n            partners such as INFONAVIT (National Housing Fund for\n            Private Sector Workers) in this case-are fully on board and\n            committed to the operation. If they are not, or cannot be\n            engaged for reasons of political economy, then an\n            operation's scope should be contained to cover the more\n            modest outcomes that can reasonably be obtained without such\n            partners. In large and sophisticated middle-income countries\n            like Mexico, an operation should avoid promising sector-wide\n            reforms when commensurate results cannot be realistically\n            achieved in the short timeframe and with the relatively\n            modest scale of assistance offered. Operations aiming to\n            support affordable housing and urban poverty reduction need\n            to be explicit about their target beneficiary populations,\n            with quantification of baselines and targets, and at\n            completion, achievements. Contrary to down-market aims,\n            establishing a sound reputation in financial markets and\n            sustaining a high quality and expanding portfolio can lead a\n            new mortgage financier up-market, by targeting higher income\n            borrowers with larger loans. Markets perceive such loans as\n            less risky. They are also less costly to manage and\n            contribute more to business growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - FOVI Restructuring Project,\n            Affordable Housing and Urban Poverty

A\n            Restructuring loan helped transform the Financial Housing\n            Aid Fund into the Federal Mortgage Corporation, a\n            well-respected and market engaged institution. Rural Finance\n            Development Structural Adjustment Loan assisted in the\n            liquidation of Banrural, an institution that introduced huge\n            distortions in the rural finance markets, and instead\n            established the Financiera Rural to provide financial\n            services to small and mid-sized rural markets. Finally, a\n            Savings and Rural Finance Loan helped with the\n            transformation of Pahnal, an economic vehicle to invest\n            small depositors\u2019 savings in risk-free government\n            instruments, into Bansefi, to provide cost pooling for\n            technological development and a common marketing brand for cooperatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Reforms that help Mexico\u2019s development\n            finance institutions thrive"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Reforms that help Mexico\u2019s\n            development finance institutions thrive"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/03/25157884/reforms-help-mexico\u2019s-development-finance-institutions-thrive","count":"Mexico","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"depositors, rural finance, financial\n            services, pdf, liquidation, transparency, results, financial\n            crisis, future, income, development banks, bank, credit,\n            banking system, information, investment projects, portfolio,\n            financial performance, mortgage, mandates, loan, private\n            sector, mergers, market, ownership, rural markets, credit\n            portfolio, development finance institutions, governance\n            structure, international bank, market segments, instruments,\n            governance, private sector investment, technological\n            development, export sector, access to financial services,\n            trade, financial sector assessment, institutions, savings,\n            financial market, investment, housing finance, market\n            development, commercial banks, performance, restructuring,\n            public funds, financial capacity, banking, cooperatives,\n            innovation, institution, development finance, monetary fund,\n            lending, financial institutions, markets, marketing,\n            enterprises, financial sector, target, adjustment loan,\n            rural finance markets, finance, development bank, banking\n            sector, income groups, employees, banks"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Rural development,Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Reformas ayudan en prosperidad de\n            instituciones mexicanas de financiamiento para el desarrollo"}},"topic":"Financial Infrastructure and Remittances\n            m1326532 350,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Inclusion m1327456 363,Financial Integrity m1326313 328,Financial Architecture and Banking\n            m1327224 318,International Financial Standards m1326534 312","projn":"MX-Savings And Rural Finance (Bansefi)\n            Additional Financing  Proje -- P103491,MX-Fovi Restructuring -- P007610,MX-Rural Finance Development Structural\n            Adjustment Loan -- P074655","subtopic":"E-Business,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Access to Finance,Emerging Markets","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083148c33_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Other financial and private sector development,Rural markets,Gender,Indigenous peoples,Rural policies and institutions,Rural non-farm income generation,Rural markets,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Regulation and competition policy,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Urban services and housing for the poor","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Financial Infrastructure and Remittances\n            m1326532 350,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Inclusion m1327456 363,Financial Integrity m1326313 328,Financial Architecture and Banking\n            m1327224 318,International Financial Standards m1326534 312","owner":"Finance & Markets - GP - IBRD (GFMDR)","trustfund":"TF021390-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR,TFM21390-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR,TFS21390-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"95257"},"facets":{}}}
