km), construction of about 6 km of\n            feeder canal and installation of automatic flow regulators;\n            construction of 4 electric pumping stations, each with an\n            elevated equalizing reservoir; construction of 50 km of 60\n            kv and 50 km of 22 kv power transmission lines and a\n            substation for pumping stations; land preparation and\n            consolidation; installation of 416 km of a buried pipe\n            distribution system and associated mobile sprinkler\n            equipment; excavation for main drainage channels; 108 km of\n            classified road rehabilitation and 85 km construction of new\n            classified roads; construction of farm access roads and\n            windbreaks; construction of buildings and provision of\n            equipment; construction of six new milk collecting centers;\n            (b) a bilharzia control programme for the Province of El\n            Jadida; (c) a feasibility study for irrigation, water supply\n            and power development based on a dam at Dechrael-Oued; and\n            (d) a feasibility study for the production, processing, and\n            marketing of
