Some lessons learned included: the institutional\n            capacity of executing agencies at all levels has to be\n            assessed carefully at appraisal and incorporated into\n            project design, implementation and disbursement schedules.\n            Baseline and follow-up surveys are essential in order to\n            measure credibly project outcome. Project flexibility is\n            essential to accommodate revisions in project design and\n            priorities, as well as changes in the political environment;\n            additionally, the rigidity of the rules and procedures of\n            the national implementing agencies is often a formidable\n            obstacle for smooth implementation. Even with a strong\n            commitment by the Borrower, problems will arise if sector\n            agencies do not share a sense of project ownership; projects\n            may be reformulated and personnel arbitrarily moved,\n            resulting in efficiency losses. The initial lack of project\n            ownership by the ministry of health proved to be one of the\n            largest constraints in project implementation. Decentralized\n            procurement and investment planning requires a high level of\n            local management capacity but results in a greater sense of\n            ownership in the states, more appropriate planning, faster\n            procurement and a more timely release of funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
