Ratings for the Sixth PRSC\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Some key lessons learned\n            included: while there were instances that the PRSC enabled\n            the Government to pursue reform policies that will otherwise\n            be unaffordable for the country, such as the extension of\n            capitation grants and the expansion of the national health\n            insurance scheme, there were other instances where the PRSC\n            were less successful. Energy sector reforms are a case in\n            point. Notwithstanding the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS)\n            efforts, the Government implemented these reforms when it\n            found fitting to do so. As a result, increases in\n            electricity tariffs were gazette but only implemented\n            belatedly and when every other source of funding for\n            subsidizing consumers had been exhausted. This mix record\n            reflects the fact that PRSC are very complex instruments,\n            with many dimensions that need to be considered jointly\n            (e.g., the fungibility of funds, the centrality of the\n            policy dialogue, the nature of conditionalities, donor\n            alignment and harmonization). More broadly, however, the\n            progress in maintaining prudent fiscal management was not\n            sustained once the Ghanaian government no longer had an\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF)-sponsored program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Fourth,
