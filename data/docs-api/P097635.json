Some\n            lessons learned includes: a project with this level of\n            economic and political complexity should be undertaken only\n            if it has broad and deep political support, including\n            amongst major donors. The project was started at a time that\n            Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) and\n            United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo\n            (UNMIK) were looking for an initiative that promised\n            strategic investor involvement and major economic returns\n            for Kosovo and political support initially appeared to be\n            solid. Keep project design as simple as possible and resist\n            pressure to make inherently difficult large scale\n            privatization projects even more complex by adding\n            components, especially when each component brings with it\n            controversial and/or unfinished business. Having an\n            experienced Bank energy professional based in the field\n            could possibly have ensured that Kosovo decision-makers\n            received more balanced advice on a regular basis and those\n            differences of opinion with major donors could have been\n            avoided or resolved before they surfaced in the open. A\n            critical success factor is a strong inter-ministerial\n            Project Steering Committee (PSC), which is committed to the\n            objective and does not inappropriately revisit decisions\n            already taken. In the case of the complex and controversial\n            Kosovo e Re (New Kosovo) Power Project (KRPP), the PSC\n            suffered from periods of weak leadership and a fractious\n            membership. Given the size and the unpredictability of\n            advisory service costs for such transactions, and especially\n            when changing circumstances result in changing demand,\n            special arrangements need to be in place to monitor the\n            Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and the financial\n            management reports in order to control costs. More decisive\n            guidance by the Bank to its staff on coal-fired power\n            projects would have been highly desirable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo - Lignite Power Technical

Mitigation measures of the\n            project are: 1) immediate securing (including fencing) of\n            the open mine and waste dump sites to prevent unauthorized\n            access; 2) implement access restriction devices and maintain\n            them in operation through a periodic verification service;\n            3)  impacted soil mapping should be prepared and appropriate\n            fencing/labeling should be introduced; 4) monitoring\n            campaign on noise to measure 8 hours dose and air quality\n            especially at the mines; 5) installation of settling ponds\n            to reduce the load of suspended solids and coal dust in mine\n            water; and 6) a noise survey should be undertaken both at\n            the work place or at the main receptors to be identified. A\n            proper comparison with applicable standards should be\n            performed in order to ascertain potential non compliance and\n            necessary mitigation measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Strategic environmental and social\n            assessment : executive summary"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo - Lignite Power Technical\n
