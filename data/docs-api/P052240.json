Some lessons learned included: strong\n            commitment on the part of GOM to sector reform and private\n            participation ensured the satisfactory outcome of the\n            project. An institutional framework was put in place well\n            before the project's start. This structure provided\n            stability and prevented the project from ending in disaster\n            when it faced serious start-up problems. The commitment to\n            the process also helped overcome the protracted period of\n            contract re-negotiations, put the project on a lasting\n            basis, ensured post-completion continuity, and helped\n            mobilize substantial additional funding to expand the sector\n            framework to other cities. In a comparable situation it will\n            be important to ensure that a strong take-over team be\n            assembled, that the contracting institutions have a chance\n            to assess the team members' qualifications - possibly\n            through interviews and trial periods, that the main\n            international partners demonstrate how the team members are\n            linked to their headquarters and have access to corporate\n            support and institutional memory, that this team coordinates\n            closely with the sector institutions from the beginning and\n            that a policy of promoting Mozambican staffing be designed\n            and put in place early during project implementation. At the\n            outset of the project, the use of the international private\n            sector was expected to be an expeditious way forward to\n            provide improved service levels quickly in post conflict\n            Mozambique that had a serious capacity shortage. There were\n            few engineers and almost no capacity in financial management\n            and utility management when the project was being developed.\n            The idea was to 'buy-in' expertise and overtime\n            build up local management capacity within the utility as\n            local manpower will reduce costs and improve profits for the\n            private operator."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Second National Water\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Second National\n            Water Development

Specifically the project seeks to: a)\n            commence institutional and regulatory reform within the\n            urban water sector with the introduction of commercial\n            principles in the operation and management of water services\n            through the use of a private sector operator; b) accelerate\n            capacity building and human resource development for the\n            sector through training and demonstration effects within the\n            context of the private operator contract; and c) provide an\n            institutional framework that improves the quality and\n            sustainability of user services and acts as an operational\n            model for water services, as these begin to be decentralized\n            to municipal based management. The project consists of three\n            components. 1) Private sector management of water supply\n            systems for five cities will support the lease contracts and\n            management contracts for water supply systems of Maputo,\n            Beira, Quelimane, Nampula, and Pemba. 2) Water supply works\n            will support water supply works, design, and supervision. 3)\n            Urban water supply policy and strategy will finance\n            consulting services, technical assistance, and purchase of\n            equipment for Council for the Regulation of Water
