Some lessons learned includes: the\n            flow of funds from the government for road maintenance had\n            to compete with emergency and security road construction and\n            other government priorities. Road maintenance had always\n            been minimal compared to the need. The project has greatly\n            contributed to addressing the principal challenge of\n            capacity limitation to deliver results in the post conflict\n            and newly emerging country. Further, training of staff only\n            by itself is not adequate in building institutional capacity\n            and it appears that direct engagement of staff during\n            procurement and contract management processes in the form of\n            on the job training is essential. The capacity of the\n            construction industry in South Sudan was very low during\n            project preparation and implementation. All contracted firms\n            were foreign and often hired workers from outside the\n            country. Lessons emerging from other places suggest\n            including some maintenance funding in the project to ensure\n            sustainability in medium term. The project experienced\n            massive claims under component two due to delays affected by\n            externalities indifferent to project activities, weak\n            reporting structures, and inexperience of the implementing\n            agencies. In order to avoid underrating the outcome of the\n            project, the formulation of the results framework should\n            have attempted to include specific objectives for each phase\n            rather than establish a general Project Development\n            Objective (PDO) for the whole project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - Emergency Transport and\n            Infrastructure
