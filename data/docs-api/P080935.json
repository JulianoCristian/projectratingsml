The wide scope of project\n            activities led to a situation whereby institutional\n            coordination was fragmented and at times implementation was\n            captured by sectoral interests. Restructuring and Mid-Term\n            Review (MTR) are important opportunities to review and\n            revise project design. Strong monitoring and evaluation\n            system is critical to drive and account for results.\n            Specialists on the World Bank and government side need to\n            design and supervise implementation of any monitoring and\n            evaluation system. The Strategies et Techniques d'Envol\n            des Entreprises (STEP) program showed that results can be\n            monitored in all the six years of its implementation.\n            Clinics on procurement and on financial management should be\n            held at any moment in the project, when issues arise. World\n            Bank team members can have advice from senior staff in\n            safeguards and procurement in the World Bank, to help\n            unblock the tourism infrastructure activity in the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Growth Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Growth Support

including mining, tourism and crafts, and\n            telecommunications'. The restructuring aims to address\n            the management weaknesses observed in the implementation of\n            the project to date and to recalibrate several project\n            components in light of changed circumstances. The\n            restructuring involves: (i) strengthening overall project\n            management structure; (ii) strengthening project financial\n            management; (iii) streamlining project monitoring and\n            evaluation; (iv) strengthening procurement processes; (v)\n            streamlining investment climate component; (vi) focusing\n            airports of Mali component on the development of a\n            public-private partnership (PPP) for airports of Mali; (vii)\n            streamlining implementation of industrial zone component;\n            (viii) strengthening implementation arrangements for tourism\n            component; (ix) expanding handicraft component; (x)\n            implementing new development of financial services\n            component; (xi) implementing enterprises support services\n            component through multi-donor fund for support services to\n            small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and (xii) streamlining\n            mining component. As a result of the restructuring, the\n            project is expected to achieve its intended development\n            outcome, as revised, to create the conditions for increased\n            private
