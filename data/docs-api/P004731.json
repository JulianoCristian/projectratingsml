Part B of the project\n            includes the implementation of a group of actions aimed at\n            strengthening and modernizing PEA's operations. PEA,\n            with assistance from the Bank, has prepared Terms of\n            Reference to retain consultants to assist PEA in these objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Provincial Power Distribution Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Provincial Power\n            Distribution Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/05/725492/thailand-provincial-power-distribution-project","projn":"TH-Power Xv(Rural Power -- P004731","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901005375"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"commercial energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,conservation,covers,crude\n            oil,deforestation,diesel engines,diesel fuel,Distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,distribution\n            systems,domestic energy,domestic oil,domestic oil\n            production,electric energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity bills,electricity\n            consumption,Electricity Generating Authority,electricity\n            sector,electricity supply,electricity tariff,electrification\n            programs,electronic data processing,energy\n            conservation,Energy Consumption,energy costs,Energy\n            Investment,Energy Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            spending,Energy Supply,fire,forms of energy,fuel,fuel\n            oil,fuel prices,fuelwood,Gas production,gas reserves,Gas\n            turbines,geothermal\n            energy,grid,Income,Insurance,Irrigation,lighting,Lignite,lignite\n            production,Mineral Resources,Mini-hydro,Natural Gas,natural\n            gas pipeline,Natural gas reserves,Oil,oil development,oil\n            equivalent,oil fields,oil prices,oil production,oil\n            shale,oil shale development,oil shock,peak\n            demand,petrol,Petroleum,Power Distribution,Power\n            Distribution System,power generation,power plants,Power\n            Sector,production capacity,Proven reserves,Provision of\n            power,reservoirs,residential consumers,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,Rural Electrification\n            Program,safety,ships,state-owned utilities,thermal\n            plants,Thermal Power,total electricity consumption,total\n            energy consumption,utilities"},"1":{"cdata!":"commercial energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,conservation,covers,crude\n            oil,deforestation,diesel engines,diesel fuel,Distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,distribution\n            systems,domestic energy,domestic oil,domestic oil\n            production,electric energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity bills,electricity\n            consumption,Electricity Generating Authority,electricity\n            sector,electricity supply,electricity tariff,electrification\n            programs,electronic data processing,energy\n            conservation,Energy Consumption,energy costs,Energy\n            Investment,Energy Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            spending,Energy Supply,fire,forms of energy,fuel,fuel\n            oil,fuel prices,fuelwood,Gas production,gas reserves,Gas\n            turbines,geothermal\n            energy,grid,Income,Insurance,Irrigation,lighting,Lignite,lignite\n            production,Mineral Resources,Mini-hydro,Natural Gas,natural\n            gas pipeline,Natural gas reserves,Oil,oil development,oil\n            equivalent,oil fields,oil prices,oil production,oil\n            shale,oil shale development,oil shock,peak\n            demand,petrol,Petroleum,Power Distribution,Power\n            Distribution System,power generation,power plants,Power\n            Sector,production capacity,Proven reserves,Provision of\n            power,reservoirs,residential consumers,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,Rural Electrification\n            Program,safety,ships,state-owned utilities,thermal\n            plants,Thermal Power,total electricity consumption,total\n            energy consumption,utilities"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"4201"},"facets":{}}}
