Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            very low-income countries receiving donor aid may succeed in\n            providing broad access to education. But without a critical\n            number o f reasonably well educated teachers, interested\n            administrators, and strong instructional supervision, the\n            educational system may provide little learning to the\n            students. Monitoring of learning outcomes is critical in all\n            education projects, particularly where very poor populations\n            are involved. Without clear and monitor able targets,\n            educational systems may enroll and graduate students who\n            lack basic skills. Governments are likely to respond to\n            donor priorities and informational requirements. If donors\n            are perceived as focusing mainly on access, governments are\n            less likely to focus on improving learning outcomes.\n            Strategies aimed at increasing girls' enrolment require\n            strong government commitment at a high level to be\n            effective.

Lessons that may benefit future operations are\n            as follows. Cross conditionalities, and invested decision\n            making by an Inter-Ministerial Committee (e.g., appointment\n            of project coordinators), are difficult to manage, and can\n            create unnecessary problems leading to delays; rather,\n            committees at this level, should be involved in the overall\n            progress evaluation, strategic directions, and policy\n            guidance. And, to ensure effective learning outcomes and\n            adequate ownership, project activities should be implemented\n            through Ministry structures, further ensuring collaboration\n            with end-users in procurement matters, and alignment with\n            government recurrent budget applications. Moreover, the\n            changing socioeconomic context of a country requires the\n            Bank to be responsive to such changes, through a project\n            design that would allow government priorities achieve their\n            full political support and ownership, and, responsive as\n            well to the specialized nature of rehabilitation, through\n            adequate consulting engineers' terms of reference, to\n            avoid unnecessary addenda during implementation. As for\n            capacity building, it is worth noting that such should not\n            be limited to staff development, but include as well,\n            broader issues of staff retention, and non-salary incentives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Capacity Building : Human\n            Resources Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Capacity Building :\n            Human Resources Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/03/1756375/mozambique-capacity-building-human-resources-development-project","projn":"MZ-Capacity Building Human Dev.
