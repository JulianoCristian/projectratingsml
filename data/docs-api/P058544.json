These projects are reviewed together because all\n            three dealt with aspects of public sector financial\n            management (PFM). However, the TA project and the SAC also\n            addressed many other policy and institutional issues. All\n            three projects suffered from flaws in project design and\n            supervision, and weak government commitment to certain\n            project objectives. The TA project and the D&R project\n            outcomes were rated unsatisfactory in Implementation\n            Completion Report (ICRs) and ICR reviews, and the SAC\n            outcome was rated unsatisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower was also rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory for TA and SAC, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for D&R is rated moderately\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the projects are: (i)\n            a substantial share of donor aid to Cambodia has been\n            allocated to TA, but results have been generally\n            disappointing. Too much TA has been donor-driven without\n            adequate Government involvement. This is changing in the\n            Bank-led support for the Public Financial Management Reform\n            Program (PFMRP); (ii) all three projects suffered from flaws\n            in project design. The TA project and the SAC were overly\n            broad in attempting to resolve too many problems through a\n            single operation. The SAC had an excessive number of\n            conditions which delayed effectiveness and tranche releases.\n            The D&R project failed to heed the public complaints\n            about falsification of the number of military personnel and\n            corruption in handling the military payroll; (iii) the Bank\n            was unrealistic in its assessment of the Government's\n            commitment to many of the reforms in public administration\n            and governance supported by these projects; (iv) the Bank\n            should have carried out more intensive supervision of\n            fiduciary issues in the International Development\n            Association (IDA) portfolio. However, after the findings\n            that led the Bank to declare misprocurement in the D&R\n            project, the subsequent fiduciary review and the ensuing\n            World Bank Department of Institutional Integrity (INT)\n            investigations, the Bank has now taken appropriate steps to\n            address these problems; and (v) the Bank delayed for almost\n            ten years before building up an adequate field office\n            presence, contrary to the lessons of experience in\n            post-conflict countries. This had an adverse effect on the\n            Bank's ability to supervise complex projects, to\n            maintain regular contact with government officials, and to\n            work effectively with other donors. This deficiency has been\n            corrected since 2003."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Technical Assistance Project;\n            Structural Adjustment Credit; and Demobilization and\n

Lessons first address political\n            stability as the major factor, actually a prerequisite, in\n            fulfilling the successful implementation of macroeconomic\n            and structural reforms, and, remains a critical factor in\n            structural adjustment reform in Cambodia. Nevertheless,\n            while the ownership of the project resided with the senior\n            officials, it was apparently less so among the ministries,\n            and technical staff involved in the program. An effective\n            vehicle would need to be instituted to involve mid-level,\n            and technical staff in the preparation of structural\n            adjustment programs. It is noted the structural adjustment\n            program dealt across ministries, and agencies without\n            proper, and effective mechanisms to enhance its\n            implementation. There is a critical need for a specific\n            inter-ministerial steering group, dedicated to assume the\n            leadership of the operation, and a secretariat with\n            representatives from affected ministries, and agencies for\n            implementation of the operation. These two groups could help\n            the Project Management Unit overcome some of the\n            bottlenecks, due to the country's weak civil service,\n            and to deal with potential rivalries among agencies. This\n            also leads to the availability of technical assistance from\n            donors, and strong Bank team support, extremely crucial in\n            low-income country with weak technical, working capacity.\n            Lessons further reinforce the need for Bank staff\n            continuity, particularly that of the Task Manager; for\n            strong dialogues with the Government, and, of specific\n            provisions, such as Intersectoral Steering Committees, or\n            Public Advisory Commissions, to help maintain and retain the\n            momentum of reform. In addition, lessons also address the\n            need for legal draftsmanship of conditionalities, to be\n            consistent between the Letter of Development Policy, the\n            Development Credit Agreement, and the Policy Matrix,\n            especially in reference to performance expectations\n            involving third parties (concessionaires), and qualitative\n            actions (restructuring, consultation). Moreover, the\n            multi-tranche release credit presents a challenge to the\n            government in fulfilling the conditions for the floating\n            tranche, and the second tranche releases, given the fragile\n            political reality in the Borrower country. It is thus\n            suggested, the reform process in Cambodia would be better\n            met by the new lending instrument, PRSC, (Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit), which provide customized support to\n            country-development, and country-owned reform programs,\n            following extensive consultations among all stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -

and discusses the progress made in\n            fulfilling the conditions for the release of the second\n            tranche of the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) Project.\n            It concludes that the Borrower has maintained a satisfactory\n            macroeconomic policy framework, achieved satisfactory\n            progress in carrying out the overall program with respect to\n            public resource management, public sector management, and\n            enhancing governance and fighting corruption, and, completed\n            six of the eight specific actions for the second tranche\n            release as required under the Development Credit Agreement.\n            One condition related to the Law on Investment has only been\n            partially completed, because after a process of extensive,\n            additional consultation with the private sector, the precise\n            formulation for the revised Law submitted to the National\n            Assembly was changed from the language inserted into the\n            tranche condition. Another condition related to the social\n            sector disbursement ratio was also only partially met\n            because flood-related expenditures raised non-social sector\n            spending in an unanticipated, but appropriate, amount. The\n            Government is continuing to support the thrusts of these two\n            conditions, by making the investment incentive regime more\n            transparent and predictable, and, by further reorienting\n            expenditures to the social sectors. In the light of\n            satisfactory overall performance, it is proposed that\n            waivers be granted on a no-objection basis for the above\n            actions in order to release the second tranche of the\n            Credit, in the amount of US$15 million equivalent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Structural adjustment Credit\n            Project : Release of second tranche -

First, the SAC program aims to assist in\n            improving public resource management which includes resource\n            mobilization and forestry management. Second, it will assist\n            in enhancing public sector management which comprises\n            expenditure rationalization and preparatory steps for\n            military demobilization and administrative reform. Third, it\n            will assist in formulating a strategy on enhancing\n            governance and fighting corruption in economic management\n            and implementing. The main benefits of the credit is that it\n            will assist the Government in making a successful transition\n            toward sustainable development with significant poverty\n            reduction and broad-based economic growth. Furthermore,\n            Cambodia will improve enabling environment for private\n            sector development through tackling governance problems. The\n            program will also contribute to improving the access of poor\n            households to basic social and economic services such as\n            basic education, health facilities, etc. The risks\n            concerning SAC implementation include: deterioration in\n            political stability; insufficient political will; weak\n            institutional capacity; and weak
