Some lessons learned included:\n            policy reforms are implemented and therefore driven by the\n            middle level government officials across the range of\n            ministries. Reforms should therefore incorporate the\n            tactical and political sense of these key government\n            counterparts when designing the pace and scope of a program.\n            Where consensus is uncertain, a deliberation process along\n            with modest expectations should be established up front to\n            allow policy options to be explored and breakthroughs to\n            emerge. To support such a process, constant dialogue between\n            the Government and the Bank is fundamental and is best\n            facilitated by a strong field presence across a wide range\n            of sectors which views policy discussions as a natural part\n            of ongoing support. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system for IDPL lacked in places, quantitative indicators,\n            baseline data, strong targets and a system for monitoring\n            and recalibration of variables. For the system to be a\n            useful management tool for Government, it is important for\n            outcomes to be monitored and attributed to design and\n            implementation issues, so that the latter can receive\n            attention. For this to occur, integration of the M&E\n            framework with the results framework is needed so: (i)\n            objectives are explicitly stated, (ii) associated outcomes\n            are targeted with numerical indicators, (iii) policy actions\n            are specified which will credibly influence the targeted\n            indicators, and (iv) on-going calibration of policy changes,\n            external changes and targeted indicators are carried out as\n            part of Government functions to support implementation of a\n            multi-year, multi-sector program of the complexity of the\n            IDPL series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Infrastructure Development Policy Loans

Development\n            Policy Loan Program for Indonesia aims to increase the\n            quantity and efficiency of Government spending on\n            infrastructure with reduced and better targeted Public\n            Service Obligation (PSO), and expenditure planning and\n            budgeting. In the face of Indonesia's rising demand for\n            infrastructure services, the Government has committed to\n            more investment and improved services in 2010 during the\n            first year of the new administration. On top of a\n            substantial 33 percent increase in the Government's\n            spending on infrastructure as part of the 2009 fiscal\n            stimulus package that was maintained in the 2010 budget, the\n            Government proposed raising the budget allocation to\n            infrastructure a further 55 percent for 2011. The\n            Government's program is also being supported by a\n            parallel series of policy loans by the Asian Development\n            Bank (ADB) and Japan International Cooperation Agency\n            (JICA), both of which give recognition to the reforms being\n            undertaken. As there is close coordination between the\n            agencies to ensure consistent messages, the World Bank, ADB\n            and Japanese support helps to ensure heightened attention to\n            the most critical reforms while encouraging momentum across\n            the broad reform agenda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fourth Infrastructure\n            Development Policy Loan
