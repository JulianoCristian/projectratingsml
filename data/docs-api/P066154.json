Ratings for the Second Public Sector\n            Management Adjustment Loan Project for Macedonia are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            satisfactory; and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Public Finance Management\n            Project for Slovak Republic are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low or\n            negligible; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned include:\n            although differences dominated similarities in the three\n            projects, the one common factor that had a determining\n            influence on outcomes was the extent of government\n            commitment to the projects. Sound analytical work was\n            necessary but not sufficient for project success. All three\n            projects were based on sound analytical work and they\n            matched government strategy. In the case of the Public\n            Finance Management Project (PFMP) there was a hand-in-glove\n            match between analytical work and government strategy, as\n            the government adopted the full recommendations of the\n            Development Policy Review. Concentrating on core elements\n            was a factor contributing to success. Compared with the\n            PFMP, the other two projects over-reached in their ambitions\n            to achieve rather wide development policy goals. In the\n            main, introducing elements that were outside the purview of\n            the budget, such as health and pension reform, affected the\n            efficacy of these two operations and prevented them from\n            fully realizing their goals. Finally, when the different\n            elements of a project fit together well, the project has a\n            greater probability of success. The different elements of\n            the PFMP fit each other better with one another than those\n            of either the Public Sector Management Credit (PSMAC) or the\n            PSMAL and were

The lessons learned indicate that at first\n            glance, the Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAC)\n            experience would appear to confirm the familiar adage that\n            Government commitment is essential to reform-and that\n            reforms should not be attempted where Government commitment\n            is lacking. If these lessons had been observed the PSMAC\n            would never have been attempted. No management reforms would\n            have been discussed until at least January 2003 and the most\n            politically controversial reforms--particularly in civil\n            service and health care--would still remain off the reform\n            agenda. In retrospect, the PSMAL experience suggests a more\n            nuanced set of lessons. It suggests that while unanimous\n            Government support for reform is desirable, Bank efforts\n            should not be delayed until it exists. The PSMAC also\n            supports the case for programmatic adjustment lending.\n            Although the follow-on operations (PSMAL, PSAL1 and PSAL2)\n            are structured as independent

sustained\n            economic growth, and improved service delivery in key social\n            sectors, and, seeks to build key institutions, strengthen\n            accountability, and efficiency of public resources, and prod\n            a sustaining macroeconomic stability, and fiscal discipline.\n            The main objectives of the project are to: 1) strengthen\n            capacity at the center of Government, to implement reforms;\n            2) strengthen fiscal discipline within a strong\n            accountability, and transparency framework, 3) improve\n            strategic prioritization within a fiscal plan; 4) improve\n            the efficiency in program, and service delivery in the\n            medium-term; and, 5) seek a merit, and performance based\n            civil service, capable of supporting the reform strategy.\n            Sustainable fiscal budget commitments, and policy\n            implementation, will be accomplished through new legislation\n            governing the issuance of Government guarantees, and\n            accountable policy formulation. Nonetheless, the security\n            crisis risks an ensured macroeconomic, and fiscal stability,\n            though implementation of the Framework Agreement should test\n            the Government's capacity to implement the program.\n            Also, the risk of policy reversal, will be minimized by\n            ensuring that approval of lending operations only occurs\n            once substantial prior actions have been undertaken, and,\n            that substantial technical assistance supports reforms\n            comprised in the adjustment
