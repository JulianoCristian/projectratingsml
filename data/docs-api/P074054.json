The\n            EERC was designed as a one-off operation, and no follow-up\n            of this type is planned.  The major factor affecting\n            implementation was ongoing political instability and\n            disagreements between the central and island governments.\n            Lessons learned concerning the ICR process: 1. The standard\n            ICR format may not be best suited to an emergency project.\n            2. In the changeable context, the process of generating and\n            drafting the ICR has been as valuable as the final report.\n            Lessons for Comoros: 1. There remains no shared\n            understanding of what the political transition out of the\n            crisis and national reconciliation mean in practice.  2.\n            Service delivery and infrastructure investments can be\n            carried out effectively if the credit implementation and\n            governance meet the highest level of standards. 3. Improved\n            communications between development agents on the different\n            islands of the country are needed.  Lessons for the Bank: 1)\n            This kind of credit involves a number of trade-offs,\n            promising high gain but is entered at high risk. 2) The\n            relationship between the Bank's operations and the\n            Bank's country strategy needs to be continuously\n            monitored and evaluated. 3) An instrument is needed allowing\n            rapid and flexible disbursement of funds, while maintaining\n            some control over the way the funds are spent.  4) Where a\n            credit is linked to an emergency recovery program, it is\n            important that it is made explicit how and to what extent\n            the activities are expected to contribute to the overall\n            objective and that suitable indicators and procedures are\n            defined. 5) A complex and flexible project carried out in a\n            volatile political environment requires regular supervision\n            and attention, coming at a heavy price in variable costs to\n            the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros -

Priority\n            expenditures in the emergency program, will support the\n            creation of decentralized institutions, and the\n            implementation of the national reconciliation agreement. The\n            project aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability, and\n            addressing urgent social needs, by financing imports,\n            including petroleum, agricultural equipment, construction\n            materials, and capital goods, while, foreign exchange will\n            be provided to finance increased import requirements arising\n            from the spending, generated by the economic recovery\n            program. The program will target urgent public expenditures\n            needed to alleviate poverty, and support the process of\n            national reconciliation. Nonetheless, risks include a) the\n            possibility that the national reconciliation process, could\n            stall, or be reversed, though careful monitoring of the\n            process, and the strong support by stakeholders, development\n            partners, and international mediators has been confirmed,\n            and, b) the Government's weak capacity to sustain\n            economic recovery efforts, but technical assistance\n            provision in expenditure management will mitigate this risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Emergency Economic Recovery Credit
