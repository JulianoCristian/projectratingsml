- Rampur Hydropower Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Rampur Hydropower\n            Project for India were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the project highlighted how\n            difficult it is to maintain focus on all components of a\n            hydropower projects when problems occur. The major\n            challenges with geology directly threatened the whole\n            project. Understandably, the client\u2019s management, as well as\n            the Bank team, put an emphasis on solving these problems.\n            The Bank team, through the aide memoires continued in\n            parallel to take up the implementation of soft components,\n            such as the EMP and capacity building program, which were\n            delayed especially during the first years when much of the\n            geological problems emerged. Large hydropower, like most\n            large infrastructure projects, are multifaceted, generally\n            include a range of sub-components and are often\n            controversial as they may have large footprints of impact.\n            The RHP has successfully shown that such impacts can be\n            positive. The RHP also showed that it is easy to overlook\n            soft components when the technical construction takes\n            additional focus.For these reasons, monitoring and\n            evaluation is crucial for a hydropower developer (and for\n            the Bank) to make sure that all components are progressing\n            as planned, and for transparency to affected people and\n            other stakeholders. Designing the project with two technical\n            components and a separate institutional strengthening\n            component allowed the attention of the client, the\n            government and the Bank to be focused on this aspect. SJVN\n            were keen to develop as an organization, but had these\n            elements been subsumed within the technical components then\n            it will have been more difficult to monitor these aspects\n            and bring them to the attention of management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
