In\n            1991, the World Bank approved a 30 million dollars loan to\n            help the government streamline the way hospitals were run by\n            keeping costs down while improving service quality. In\n            addition, the Hospital Restructuring Reform Support Project\n            aimed to make sure that those organizations enjoying\n            hospital services actually paid for them as well. The\n            project decentralized decision-making and responsibilities\n            in 23 of the largest hospitals, introducing modern\n            management processes and setting up boards for oversight.\n            Case load and services had risen, but hospitals still\n            managed to reduce operating expenses by 27 percent. In\n            short, more efficient hospitals now respond better to\n            Tunisians' health needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Reforming the hospital system"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Reforming the hospital system"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23807090/tunisia-reforming-hospital-system","count":"Tunisia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aging, chronic diseases, health conditions,\n            health insurance, health insurance funds, health needs,\n            hospital financing, hospital services, Hospital System,\n            public hospital, public hospital system, public hospitals, urbanization"}},"majtheme":"Human development","topic":"Health Referral Systems m1326362 1400,Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Health Policy and Planning m1327535 1401,Hospital Management m1326148 1399,Provider Payment to Hospitals m1326109 1302","projn":"TN-Hospital Restructuring Reform Support\n            Project -- P005738","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Health Law,Disease Control & Prevention,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Law and Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150116093659"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!107234"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!107234"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!107234"}},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"Health","theme":"Health system performance","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Law and Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Referral Systems m1326362 1400,Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Health Policy and Planning m1327535 1401,Hospital Management m1326148 1399,Provider Payment to Hospitals m1326109 1302","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF031690-MOROCCO - HEALTH MGMT AND\n            FINANC.

Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are rated satisfactory overall.
