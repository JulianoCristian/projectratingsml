While the adjustment component of the project\n            is likely to be sustainable, the investment component\n            sustainability remains unclear, mainly, due to the lack of\n            statistical information supporting the impact of credit\n            lines in the private sector, and its potentiality. Both the\n            Bank, and the Borrower's performances gave mixed\n            results, for although overall, both were rated, as\n            satisfactory, the Bank supervision is rated as deficient,\n            given an irregular supervision, and, the Borrower's\n            compliance with loan covenants, is rated deficient, due to\n            its non-completion of the technical assistance program, and\n            continued auditing deficiencies. The key lessons spell out\n            the effectiveness of successive projects in building\n            sectoral reforms, since, the continuation of the credit\n            lines financed by the Bank, contributed to meet the shortage\n            needs of long-term investment resources. However,\n            cancellation of investment loans took place, due to the high\n            cost of Bank funds in relation to decreasing Moroccan\n            interest rates. Unfortunately, the lending instrument at the\n            time - Sector Adjustment Lending, based on the Bank's\n            own cost of funds, with a tendency to lag in a falling rate\n            environment - hindered success. Had the new LIBOR-based\n            products been available, such funds might have remained competitive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Financial Sector Development
