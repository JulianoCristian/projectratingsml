All three\n            projects stressed the importance of involving stakeholders\n            to build consensus around sector policies. Other lessons\n            learned from the Industrial and Vocational Training Project\n            are: Agents and procedures for project coordination can\n            accelerate procurement in slow disbursing projects.\n            Clearly-defined procedures are essential for appraising\n            sub-projects during implementation. Time-bound, monitorable\n            performance indicators are important to guiding\n            implementation and measuring achievement of objectives. Key\n            lessons from the Education Sector Development Project are:\n            Projects will fail if little attention is paid to\n            implementation. Frequent changes in personnel, including\n            roles and responsibilities, impede achievement of objectives\n            on higher levels. Improving learning achievements requires a\n            holistic and integrated approach, which goes beyond the\n            measurement of quantitative inputs. Lessons learned from the\n            Higher and Technical Education Project are: To keep\n            implementation on schedule, the Bank has to establish\n            ownership of the project at national and institutional\n            levels. The government and the Bank should first insist on\n            sound sectoral and sub-sectoral policies before investing in\n            such projects. Project objectives need to be scaled to take\n            account of the local implementation capacity. Procurement\n            procedures need to be harmonized. Statutes of the governing\n            councils and education boards need updating."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius - Industrial and Vocational\n            Training Project, Education Sector

The main objective of the ESMP\n            is to reinforce the international competitiveness of\n            Mauritius' labor force, and transform the country into\n            a technologically more sophisticated economy.  The ESMP\n            plans to increase access to and improve the quality of\n            secondary education, with the specific target of increasing\n            secondary enrollments by 15,000 students.  Other objectives\n            include improving the quality and efficiency of education at\n            all levels, expanding tertiary education, and strengthening\n            education sector planning and management.  To achieve these\n            objectives, the project supports ESMP policy measures.  The\n            project finances the following investments designed to:  (1)\n            increase access to and promote equity of education by:  (a)\n            providing for the rehabilitation of 25 dilapidated primary\n            schools and construction of 13 new primary schools in\n            underserved regions; (b) renovating 21 state secondary\n            schools and constructing 5 new secondary schools; (c)\n            providing financial support to upgrade schools and\n            enrollment capacity; and (d) expanding enrollment capacity\n            at the University of Mauritius; (2) improve the quality of\n            education by:  (a) funding the design and implementation of\n            a renewed national system to assess student achievement; (b)\n            supporting pre-service and in-service teacher training; and\n            (c) providing library materials and teaching aids; and (3)\n            strengthen education sector management by:  (a) assisting\n            the tertiary education commission to prepare institutional\n            development plans for higher education institutions; (b)\n            establishing an education management information system; (c)\n            supporting research to explore alternative approaches for\n            more effective, efficient and flexible delivery of\n            education; (d) developing a viable institutional framework\n            for a national schools inspectorate; and (e) establishing a\n            network of regional education centers to provide educational\n            support to schools at the regional level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius -

The main objective of the ESMP\n            is to reinforce the international competitiveness of\n            Mauritius' labor force, and transform the country into\n            a technologically more sophisticated economy.

Other objectives\n            include improving the quality and efficiency of education at\n            all levels, expanding tertiary education, and strengthening\n            education sector planning and management.
