The factor leading to the cancellation of\n            the Project was the government's failure to gain\n            consensus and obtain the second and final Congressional\n            approval by a qualified (two thirds) majority required for\n            approval of external borrowing and for project\n            effectiveness. A lesson learned for the Bank is that in\n            countries such as El Salvador where loans have to be\n            ratified by a qualified majority of Congress, and the\n            Congress is

Among potential\n            negative impacts are the following:  1) El Salvador-the most\n            densely populated country in Latin America- is highly prone\n            to natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, and\n            volcanoes. In order to prevent the titling of parcels in\n            risk-prone areas, the project will screen lands to be titled\n            in risk areas and prohibit any titling activity in such\n            areas.  2) There is no evidence linking the project's\n            land administration activities (which do not include\n            regularization of persons living in protected areas) with\n            protected area encroachment. However, the project's\n            communication strategy will include specific messages so as\n            to minimize false expectations of persons currently living\n            on state lands (protected areas and mangroves), explicitly\n            to prevent short-term encroachment expansion. 3) Project\n            procedures have been developed to ensure that in case\n            project activities find evidence of cultural property on\n            private lands, that information will be forwarded to CONCULTURA."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -

This will facilitate better\n            land-related investments, and more productive and\n            environmentally sustainable land use. However, and as\n            specified within the social assessment, a major project risk\n            is the political factor, namely that the project might be an\n            instrument that favors particular groups over others. This\n            Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) sets the measures to ensure\n            all groups, i.e., indigenous populations, ethnic groups, and\n            minorities, benefit from implementation of the project. The\n            National Registry Center (CNR) will be responsible for\n            implementing awareness campaigns informing on the potential\n            project benefits, as well as location of the project area,\n            and activities to be developed. This will be achieved within\n            the first project component, through media communication,\n            particularly targeting isolated rural areas. In addition,\n            under the second component, capacity building should ensure\n            that beneficiaries are aware of their rights and\n            responsibilities in terms of land tenure, including of\n            procedures and land registry costs, and legal issues. This\n            will also be the responsibility of the CNR, and of lawyers\n            who will be directly involved in capacity building. Finally,\n            under the third component, a monitoring and evaluation\n            program will be in place to process household surveys and\n            data gathered, ensure compliance with specified safeguards,\n            and provide grievance mechanisms, should conflict occur."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Second Land Administration\n            Project : indigenous peoples plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador \u2013 Segundo Proyecto de\n            Administraci\u00f3n de Tierras: Marco de Desarrollo de Pueblos\n            Ind\u00edgenas (Vol. 2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5544423/el-salvador-second-land-administration-project-indigenous-peoples-plan-vol-2","projn":"SV-Land Administration II -- P086953","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","count":"El Salvador","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!545133"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!545133"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!545133"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050112153828"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Law and justice,Central government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","theme":"Land administration and management,Municipal governance and institution building,Rural markets,Personal and property rights,Legal institutions for a market economy","lang":"Spanish","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Land administration;
