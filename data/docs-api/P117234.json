Support\n            Credit Program (PRSC-6) is an integral part of the\n            Bank's strategy to support the implementation of\n            Mozambique's 'Second Action Plan for the Reduction\n            of Absolute Poverty' (known as PARPA II by its\n            Portuguese acronym), aided by the performance assessment\n            framework (PAF) agreed by the government and the nineteen\n            external partners (the G19) providing general budget support\n            (GBS). While the PRSC operations will provide financial\n            support for implementing the whole PARPA, they are to be\n            disbursed against the upfront completion of a number of\n            specific reform measures identified in the PAF. The\n            operation is the first in a new PRSC series of three annual\n            single-tranche operations to be delivered over FY10-12. This\n            program document also provides an indication of the triggers\n            for the subsequent two operations in the PRSC series. The\n            PRSC series is a key component of the country partnership\n            strategy (CPS) approved by the Board in May 2007, and\n            closely aligned to the government program. Bank support to\n            the PARPA II is through the FY08-11 CPS. As government\n            policies and budget are the key instruments for implementing\n            the PARPA, the Bank is committed to supporting and aligning\n            with the budget process. The indicative lending scenario of\n            the CPS envisages programmatic support through consecutive\n            PRSC, with a focus on supporting Mozambique's efforts\n            in increasing accountability and public voice and fostering\n            sustainable and broad-based growth. In line with the\n            government program, and as projects\n            ('mega-projects') reflected in the CPS, the\n            program supported by the PRSC series recognizes the\n            centrality of the growth agenda and the importance of\n            enhanced public financial management reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Sixth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit
