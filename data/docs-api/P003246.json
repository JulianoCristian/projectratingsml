The key lessons learned are: 1) A satisfactory\n            outcome for a technical assistance project is most likely\n            where policy reform is effectively linked to investment\n            support. 2) The experience of this project underlines the\n            value of flexibility in the development of project component\n            to achieve project objectives. 3) Sector policy and\n            institutional reforms require political commitment, a clear\n            timetable, and a set of realistic and achievable steps in\n            order to be successful as well as to be based on sound, well\n            argued analysis of alternative approaches. 4) The\n            effectiveness of International Development\n            Association's performance was enhanced by the synergies\n            between the preparation and implementation of the project\n            and the development of the Road Maintenance Initiative\n            program in Zambia. 5) Early attention to project management\n            and coordination arrangements in project processing and\n            early remedial action where such arrangements are not\n            performing for whatever

financing of roads on a\n            sustainable long-term basis, and (b) enhanced opportunities\n            for private sector participation in the rehabilitation and\n            maintenance of roads.  The second objective is to strengthen\n            the government's capacity to plan and coordinate public\n            expenditures for roads, and to monitor sector performance.\n            The third is to carry out the preparatory engineering work\n            for the first year program of a proposed multi-year Roads\n            Rehabilitation Project (RRP).  The project will finance\n            technical assistance and studies which, taken together,\n            will:  (a) provide the elements required for creating a\n            sustainable, efficient system for managing roads; and (b)\n            prepare the first year of the proposed RRP.
