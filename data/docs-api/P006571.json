Since\n            1995, the Demonstration Projects (PDA) have been providing\n            resources for promoting, testing, and disseminating a wide\n            range of community-based initiatives in both the Amazon and\n            Atlantic Forest regions. The demonstration projects have\n            three aims: to stimulate the development of environmentally,\n            economically and socially sustainable systems of natural\n            resource management and conservation by local communities\n            through a small grants program;  to inform other community\n            groups, researchers, and policymakers about the lessons\n            learned from local sub-projects; and to strengthen the\n            capacity of local populations and support two of the most\n            important Brazilian NGO networks: GTA (Amazon Working Group)\n            and RMA (Atlantic Forest Network)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Involving local communities in saving the\n            Brazilian rain forest : Pilot Program Demonstration Projects (PDA)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Involving local communities in\n            saving the Brazilian rain forest : Pilot Program\n            Demonstration Projects (PDA)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2005/12/23926025/involving-local-communities-saving-brazilian-rain-forest-pilot-program-demonstration-projects-pda","count":"Brazil","lang":"Arabic","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Atlantic Forests,\n            biologically diverse areas, Brazilian Rain Forest,\n            conservation, degraded lands, Demonstration Projects,\n            dissemination, domestic animals, Environmental education,\n            environmental protection, food crops, forestry, Forests,\n            improvements in management, indigenous groups, Local\n            Communities, natural resource, natural resource management,\n            natural resource use, natural resources, nature, nature\n            conservation, Rain Forest, raise awareness, role of women,\n            rural areas, species, sustainable development, sustainable\n            resource use, technical assistance, timber, timber forest,\n            timber forest products, tree, tree species"}},"alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Hacer part\u00edcipe a las comunidades\n            locales en las labores para salvar la selva tropical brasilena"},"1":{"cdata!":"Hacer part\u00edcipe a las comunidades\n            locales en las labores para salvar la selva tropical brasilena"}},"topic":"Forests m1325978 1777,Wildlife Resources m1327131 605,Sustainable Forest Management m1327128 1057,Forestry m1326646 436","projn":"BR-Rf Demonstration Projects - Pda -- P006571","subtopic":"Population Policies,Wildlife Resources,Ecosystems and Natural Habitats,Forestry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Rural Development,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20150130064816"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Forestry","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"Rainforest","topicv3":"Forests m1325978 1777,Wildlife Resources m1327131 605,Sustainable Forest Management m1327128 1057,Forestry m1326646 436","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF021946-BRAZILIAN RAIN FOREST (ADMINISTRATIVE),TF026655-CEC DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS,TF026659-RFT DEMONSTRATION PROJECT,TFM26655-CEC DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS,TFS26655-CEC DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"92579"},"5606791":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/09/5606791/brazil-rain-forest-demonstration-projects-pda","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/09/5606791/brazil-rain-forest-demonstration-projects-pda","new_url":"2004/09/5606791/brazil-rain-forest-demonstration-projects-pda","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/02/16/000112742_20050216122001/Rendered/INDEX/310330BR.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/02/16/000112742_20050216122001/Rendered/PDF/310330BR.pdf","docdt":"2004-09-20T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2005-02-16T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rain Forest Demonstration Projects (PDA)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the Rain Forest\n            Demonstration Projects (Type A) for Brazil was satisfactory\n            with likely sustainability, substantial institutional\n            development impact and satisfactory performances by both the\n            Bank and the Borrower.
