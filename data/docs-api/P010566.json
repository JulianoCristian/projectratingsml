Ratings for the\n            Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project for India were\n            as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            physical and financial sustainability of a road network\n            hinges on the road agency's capacity to undertake\n            needs-based and timely implementation of road improvement\n            and maintenance works. This enables optimal use of available\n            funds, and avoids greater costs of repair in the future.\n            Beyond project completion, Gujarat has worked to consolidate\n            its capacity for and progress in monitoring road condition\n            data and prioritizing road works on that basis.\n            Institutional and administrative capacity-building should be\n            carried out in step with the readiness of the target agency\n            to internalize it. The ability to improve capacity on\n            multiple fronts such as planning, procurement, contract\n            management, and environmental and social safeguards may\n            differ from one road agency to another, and may take more\n            than one project cycle to materialize. As road agencies\n            evolve from being providers of roads services to managers of\n            increasingly outsourced functions, it is essential that core\n            competencies are retained and strengthened to ensure\n            sustainable management of the road network. The core\n            competencies relating to planning, technical design, road\n            management systems, procurement, contract management and\n            environmental and social safeguards have been impacted to\n            different extents in Gujarat and Karnataka due to\n            outsourcing to consulting firms, staff turnover, staff\n            depletion and lack of follow-up training. The roads agency\n            should lead the way in creating a productive working\n            relationship with other entities involved in the\n            implementation of roads projects. A culture of partnership\n            and cooperation was demonstrated in Gujarat between the\n            roads and buildings department, road works contractors and\n            supervising engineers which minimized disputes and speeded\n            up implementation. A knowledge product that seeks to cover a\n            subject that has already been well studied must provide\n            clear justification of its likely added value."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) careful design and cost review\n            at the pre-bidding stage will lead to lower costs of the\n            works; 2) agency's strong commitment will also lead to\n            cost reductions; 3) strong contract management by the\n            Employer is indispensable to minimize delay and keep\n            implementation within the contractually stipulated time\n            frame; 4) a good management consultant supporting the\n            overall function of the employer will help the employer to\n            enhance his contract management and capacity building; 5)\n            the success of the Environmental Management Unit was due to\n            strong consultant's guidance in the preparation stage\n            and repeated training programs during implementation; 6)\n            repeated consultation is likely to bring about stakeholder\n            satisfaction and contribute to the project success; 7) a\n            principal rule for success of a project is that strong\n            continued leadership and commitment of the implementing\n            agency's top management is a key factor; 8) supervision\n            of periodic maintenance by the implementing agency is a good\n            hands-on technical capacity building opportunity to enhance\n            its role as the owner of the network; and 9) performance\n            indicators for measuring the outcome of institutional\n            capacity enhancement need careful attention to capture the

These measures\n            mitigate impacts: To control dust, spray water at mixing\n            sites, on temporary roads, and at regular intervals; use\n            coal ash with 30 percent water content; cover vehicles; seal\n            mixing equipment; install dust-removal devices; use proper\n            road surface runoff and drainage; replace roadside trees;\n            and encourage afforestation. To control air pollution,\n            conform to emissions standards; distance asphalt-mixing\n            sites; and regularly monitor worker health and emissions\n            levels. To control noise, enforce noise standards; enforce\n            worker airplug and helmet use; limit work hours; monitor\n            vehicle and machine maintenance; and employ sound barriers,\n            berms, and other soundproofing materials. Use retaining\n            walls to prevent floods, and excavate to replace area of\n            water bodies. To improve drainage, minimize earth movements;\n            avoid contamination from fuel and lubricants; dispose of\n            cement and steel reinforcements; and replace or relocate\n            wells. Contain water erosion on soil by replanting and\n            reseeding. Fill in borrow pits holding contaminants.\n            Retaining walls and barriers will minimize cross sections\n            while protecting flora.
