 accelerate the development of the private sector, strengthen\n            the financial sector, and promote growth notably in two\n            sectors where private sector activity is promising: fishing\n            and mining.

The reform program includes: (i)\n            unification of foreign exchange rates; (ii) strengthening\n            the legal and judiciary environment through, inter alia, the\n            revision of legal codes pertaining to business and the\n            training of judges and lawyers; (iii) reorganizing the\n            accounting and audit profession, strengthening the minimum\n            requirements for qualification and revising the accounting\n            plan; (iv) empowering the Chamber of Commerce and\n            strengthening it so it can represent private sector interest\n            vis-a-vis the authorities and help provide needed services;\n            (v) adopting and continuously enforcing new Banking Law to\n            ensure sound banking practices are applied; (vi) continuing\n            the regular issue of Treasury bills and the movement to\n            indirect instruments of monetary control; (viii) formulation\n            of a strategy for the second phase of financial sector\n            development; (ix) strengthening the surveillance of fishing\n            activities; (x) strengthening supervisory and research\n            institutions in the fishing sector; (xi) disengaging the\n            State form production and marketing of fishing activities;\n            and (xii) strengthening the framework for mining sector\n            development, including the revision of the mining code and\n            taxation applied to mining, reorganization and strengthening\n            of supervisory and regulatory institutions, and
