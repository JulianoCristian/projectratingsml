The objectives were to: (a) alleviate\n            poverty in rural areas by providing farmers with access to\n            markets, thereby stimulating food production and employment\n            opportunities; (b) provide the infrastructure required to\n            support land settlement efforts; (c) facilitate provision of\n            health care and other services to the rural population; and\n            (d) further strengthen institution-building efforts in\n            Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG)  and the\n            provincial governments started under the RRIP. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (a) improve the pre-qualification process by making it more\n            rigorous and transparent and this would reduce contract\n            terminations and recissions, unnecessary delays and project\n            costs; (b) speed up clearances by the Bank and procurement\n            procedures and disbursements by the borrower; (c) improve\n            Bank supervision during the implementation stage; (d) engage\n            the services of an independent technical consultant to\n            assure quality control in project performance; (e) perform\n            adequate maintenance to assure project sustainability; and,\n            (f) establish clear and realistic capacity building goals\n            for the implementing agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Second Rural Roads Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Second Rural Roads\n            Improvement
