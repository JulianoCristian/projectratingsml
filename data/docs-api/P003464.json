It aimed to: (a) expedite system reforms at the\n            regional level leading to greater autonomy for and\n            accountability of enterprise management while enhancing the\n            regulatory role of municipal authorities; (b) modernize and\n            restructure viable enterprises; (c) improve internal\n            enterprise management and systems; (d) strengthen\n            institutional infrastructure (including research and design\n            institutes and vocational training schools); and (e) support\n            the preparation of a long-term overall industrial\n            development strategy for Tianjin. The Bank's overall\n            performance has been rated as satisfactory. Overall, the\n            performance of the borrower (the government and China\n            Investment Bank (CIB) combined) has been rated as marginally\n            satisfactory, mainly because of poor operational and\n            financial performance of restructured enterprises. The\n            outcome of the project is considered unsatisfactory, at\n            present. There are four main lessons to be learned from this\n            operation: (a) The profitability of industrial projects is\n            influenced by the country's overall macroeconomic and\n            sectoral policies, institutional framework, and competition;\n            (b) The assessment of market viability is of critical\n            importance for industrial projects; (c) The culture of\n            enterprises does not change swiftly; (d) Financial\n            institutions that are responsible for the appraisal and\n            supervision of subprojects are often optimistic about market\n            forecast and cost estimates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Tianjin Light Industry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Tianjin Light Industry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/11/731794/china-tianjin-light-industry-project","projn":"CN-Tianjin Light Indust -- P003464","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,General Technology,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980217140206"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other industry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,actual\n            cost,autonomy,Bank Performance,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,computer hardware,cost\n            savings,debt,decentralization,devaluation,development\n            strategy,division of labor,economic performance,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economies of\n            scale,economists,employment,environmental\n            problems,exports,Financial institutions,financial\n            performance,Financial sector,financial structure,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,future\n            studies,imports,income,Industrial Technology,institutional\n            development,intermediaries,know-how,loan\n            commitments,managers,marketing,modem,Modernization,monopolies,new\n            products,pilot plants,policy environment,pollution,pollution\n            control,price controls,Printing,Private Sector,production\n            efficiency,profitability,quotas,resource\n            use,savings,schools,surplus labor,Technical\n            Assistance,technological development,vocational\n            training,workers,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,accounting,actual\n            cost,autonomy,Bank Performance,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,computer hardware,cost\n            savings,debt,decentralization,devaluation,development\n            strategy,division of labor,economic performance,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economies of\n            scale,economists,employment,environmental\n            problems,exports,Financial institutions,financial\n            performance,Financial sector,financial structure,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,future\n            studies,imports,income,Industrial Technology,institutional\n            development,intermediaries,know-how,loan\n            commitments,managers,marketing,modem,Modernization,monopolies,new\n            products,pilot plants,policy environment,pollution,pollution\n            control,price controls,Printing,Private Sector,production\n            efficiency,profitability,quotas,resource\n            use,savings,schools,surplus labor,Technical\n            Assistance,technological development,vocational\n            training,workers,working capital"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.
