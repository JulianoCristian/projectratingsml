Bank's performance was\n            highly satisfactory. Borrower's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            the major obvious lesson to be drawn from the Oso project is\n            that, despite its large and complex physical nature, the\n            financing and covenant structure was relatively simple; and\n            (ii) given Nigeria's current economic difficulties and\n            scarcity of resources, there is a need to ensure in future\n            major upstream petroleum developments that priority be given\n            first to  International Finance Corporation (IFC) sponsored\n            private sector financings with the Bank being utilized only\n            in its potential last resort capacity, subject to restoring\n            and maintaining a viable and stable macroeconomic framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -

In addition, the project will contribute\n            to the institutional strengthening of the Nigerian National\n            Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) by assisting in establishing\n            the first formal joint operating agreement for upstream oil\n            operations in Nigeria, strengthening NNPC's ability to\n            market condensate, and reviewing NNPC's rolling\n            five-year corporate plans and commercialization program.\n            The project consists of the commercial development of the\n            Oso condensate field jointly owned in undivided interests by\n            NNPC and Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN).  The field is\n            situated 12 miles off-shore southeastern Nigeria.\n            Recoverable reserves from the reservoir to be developed\n            under the project are estimated conservatively at 330\n            million barrels over the 21-year life of the project, with a\n            production profile of 100,000 barrels per day during the\n            first three to four years, and declining gradually\n            thereafter.  The facilities consists of eight off-shore\n            platforms for wellheads, production facilities, gas\n            compression and living quarters; 120 miles of sub-sea\n            pipelines for condensate and gas; onshore condensate storage\n            and metering systems; and an offshore tanker loading\n            facility for condensate.
