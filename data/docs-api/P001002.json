The war, which lasted from\n            1998 to June 1999, and the ensuing period of instability\n            that ended with the election of a new government in December\n            1999, combined with the one-year suspension of the IDA\n            credit, impeded project implementation and compromised some\n            of the project's results. In fact, the war paralyzed\n            the entire health delivery system and contributed to the\n            serious deterioration of health indicators particularly in\n            the capital city of Bissau as documented by National Health\n            and Development Program supervision mission of March/April\n            2000. The key lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: 1) Project ownership and community engagement must\n            be ensured. 2) Human resources development should not be\n            limited to training. 3) Public/private partnership and the\n            contracting-out of services is a prerequisite for expansion\n            of health care services. 4) The success registered under the\n            social fund component demonstrated that nongovernmental\n            organizations can be and should play an important role in\n            expanding primary health care and prevention and reaching\n            the poorest segments of the population. 5) Donor\n            coordination and complementarity are most effective when\n            Government is committed and leads and owns the health\n            planning and implementation process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau -

wider base of the population, with\n            a special focus on the most vulnerable groups, particularly\n            those at the periphery in rural areas of the country. In\n            order to achieve this objective the project will finance\n            high priority investment, through coordinating efforts with\n            other donor agencies, strengthening institutions and\n            developing human capacity building measures. The\n            project's design should enhance dialogue and create\n            synergy among various social sector institutions and\n            nongovernmental organizations. In health, the project will\n            finance: (a) rehabilitation and equipping of health centers\n            in three regions, and health posts, through community\n            participation, throughout the country; (b) comprehensive\n            support for in-service, local and short-term training\n            programs for all levels of health workers and professionals;\n            and (c) technical assistance and institutional strengthening\n            inputs to coordinate and strengthen the delivery of\n            information, education and communications (IEC) activities,\n            develop an IEC policy framework, and suggest targeted\n            programs.
