The Land Reform Areas Project received\n            unsatisfactory ratings in the area of development outcome,\n            in light of its limited relevance to the objectives of\n            sustainable land management and poverty reduction, as well\n            as its poor economic rate of return. Institutional\n            development impact is rated negligible because management\n            and planning capacity of the implementing agency was not\n            enhanced by the project. The audit rates borrower and Bank\n            performance as unsatisfactory, primarily because both\n            parties performed poorly during the identification and\n            preparation phase, creating a project that responded weakly\n            to the development needs of Thailand. The Second Land\n            Titling Project received an outcome rate of satisfactory\n            rather than highly satisfactory because the project failed\n            to meet its original titling target. Furthermore it did not\n            grapple with broader land administration issues, notably the\n            unclear boundaries between private and public land. OED\n            finds Bank performance and borrower performance to have been\n            satisfactory rather than highly satisfactory, because\n            institutional weaknesses could have been more fully\n            addressed, coordination with other land administration\n            agencies could have been stronger, and more provision could\n            have been made for evaluating the impact of land titling on\n            poverty reduction and natural resource management. The\n            following lessons were gleaned from the projects: land\n            titling and land reform efforts need to be grounded in an\n            overall rural development strategy that weighs the relative\n            cost and likely impact of various alternatives for reducing\n            rural poverty and improving natural resource management; the\n            success of systematic adjudication in Thailand owes much to\n            circumstances that may not apply elsewhere; there is a need\n            to provide farmers in the Land Reform Areas with efficient\n            land surveying services leading to full (NS4) title, define\n            and mark forest boundaries to enable the titling of\n            contiguous lands, and share land information data more\n            effectively between government agencies; and the case for\n            freeing up land in state hands should be carefully considered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Land Reform Areas

The\n            overall outcome of the project was rated satisfactory; the\n            performance of the Bank and the borrower was rated\n            satisfactory. The project aimed to develop public lands\n            which had been encroached on by small farmers, intensify\n            rain fed agricultural activities and improve land use in\n            those areas, expand agricultural exports, and alleviate\n            rural poverty. Lessons learned are as follows: (a) land\n            reform projects that improve the security of land ownership\n            combined with the provision of economic and social\n            infrastructure, and services close to national standards can\n            improve farm incomes, and thus help reduce encroachment, and\n            deforestation; (b) the sustainability of infrastructure\n            maintenance cannot be assured by the Agricultural land\n            Reform Office (ALRO) in the long term unless efforts are\n            made to undertake early joint planning with agencies whose\n            core function is infrastructure development, ensure\n            standards equivalent to those of similar infrastructure in\n            other parts of the country, and transfer maintenance\n            responsibilities to the relevant agencies; (c) to induce\n            farmers to invest more in sustaining and raising land\n            productivity, it is necessary to improve accessibility of\n            institutional credit, possibly through conversion of the\n            ALRO 4.01 certificate into a full land title which can serve\n            as bank collateral; and (d) project design should be\n            flexible to allow changes in response to farmers, needs and\n            involvement of local people should be sought in planning and\n            implementation of rural infrastructure such as rock weirs,\n            and service tracks to ensure optimum utilization and\n            maintenance of these facilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand -

alleviation of poverty, and\n            improved land use. It will pursue these aims by\n            strengthening the capability of the Agricultural Land Reform\n            Office (ALRO) to implement a series of land reform and\n            development projects on encroached public lands and by\n            demonstrating the viability of a land reform and\n            infrastructure development model in an initial set of nine\n            land reform areas (LRAs) of 192,000 ha affecting some 35,000\n            low-income families. Furthermore, it will promote\n            appropriate land use by releasing the LRAs from forest\n            reserve status through degazettement and by promoting soil\n            conservation on sloping land. Finally, it will facilitate\n            the absorption of the LRAs into the provincial\n            administrative framework. The major risk associated with\n            implementation of the project concerns the fact that ALRO\n            has not yet had extensive experience in implementing land\n            distribution measures and coordinating the activities of\n            other agencies involved in LRAs. The extensive use of\n            technical assistance and the adoption of a subproject\n            approach are meant to minimize this risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Land Reform Areas Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Land Reform Areas Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/08/725935/thailand-land-reform-areas-project","projn":"TH-Land Reform Dev -- P004729","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Land Use and Policies,Forestry,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912553983"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agricultural\n            Cooperatives,Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            Economics,Agricultural Extension,Agricultural\n            Land,agricultural production,agricultural\n            research,Agricultural Sector,Agriculture,area under\n            cultivation,areas of\n            forest,Auditing,consolidation,crops,cultivated\n            area,cultivation,deforestation,degradation,development\n            projects,drainage,employment,equipment,erosion,extension\n            services,Farm size,farmers,farms,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fisheries,forest,Forest Industries,forest land,forest\n            lands,forest reserves,forest village,forestry,health\n            services,housing,improved land,income\n            distribution,incomes,Institutional Development,Land\n            Development,land distribution,Land Policy,Land Reform,land\n            resources,land tenure,land transfers,land\n            use,land-use,landless laborers,legislation,livestock,market\n            value,MARKETING,natural resources,poverty\n            alleviation,Present Value,private land,private\n            sector,productivity,public agencies,public land,public\n            lands,public services,reforestation,regulatory\n            framework,rural development,social services,soil\n            conservation,soil quality,squatters,topography,urban\n            migration,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agricultural\n            Cooperatives,Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            Economics,Agricultural Extension,Agricultural\n            Land,agricultural production,agricultural\n            research,Agricultural Sector,Agriculture,area under\n            cultivation,areas of\n            forest,Auditing,consolidation,crops,cultivated\n            area,cultivation,deforestation,degradation,development\n            projects,drainage,employment,equipment,erosion,extension\n            services,Farm size,farmers,farms,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fisheries,forest,Forest Industries,forest land,forest\n            lands,forest reserves,forest village,forestry,health\n            services,housing,improved land,income\n            distribution,incomes,Institutional Development,Land\n            Development,land distribution,Land Policy,Land Reform,land\n            resources,land tenure,land transfers,land\n            use,land-use,landless laborers,legislation,livestock,market\n            value,MARKETING,natural resources,poverty\n            alleviation,Present Value,private land,private\n            sector,productivity,public agencies,public land,public\n            lands,public services,reforestation,regulatory\n            framework,rural development,social services,soil\n            conservation,soil quality,squatters,topography,urban\n            migration,water supply"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"3553"},"facets":{}}}
