The project offers\n            valuable lessons in several areas. First, it demonstrates\n            how important financial sector regulation is. Second, it\n            underscores the importance of taking a proactive position on\n            financial sector policy issues. Third, it illustrates the\n            importance of the quality of the policy dialogue, and it\n            provides an example of how a state-of-the-art approach to\n            financial system regulation could be included in the overall\n            policy dialogue between the Bank, and a developing country.\n            Fourth, it provides an example of an operational framework\n            for a complicated and relatively new subject which the Bank\n            and the international community had very little experience\n            in, especially for the developing world.
