On the positive side, the project has contributed\n            to the structural transformation of Togo's economy\n            initiated under previous adjustment operations. Lessons\n            learned include: Because the political scene was volatile,\n            it would have been preferable to envisage a series of small\n            one-tranche adjustment operations, which would each be\n            triggered only after milestones were reached in a\n            medium-term program. It was agreed to sell 40 percent of the\n            shares and to complement this with corporate governance\n            measures to guarantee autonomous management of the\n            privatized company. The strategy for clearing domestic\n            arrears formulated in 1997 was appropriate, but to complete\n            its implementation would have required sustained fiscal\n            consolidation. In a context where the political situation\n            remains unsettled, macroeconomic improvements are prone to\n            reversal, but structural reforms are more resilient and can\n            help the economy to rebound once political problems get resolved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Economic Recovery and Adjustment\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo -

        Togo following the economic and fiscal collapse of 1992-93.\n            Its main objectives are to restore macroeconomic stability,\n            support a strong private sector-led supply response to the\n            devaluation of the CFA franc, and improve the delivery of\n            essential social services. The adjustment package under the\n            operation supports the restoration of macroeconomic\n            stability through: 1) public finance measures to rebuild the\n            tax base, contain expenditures and clear arrears; and 2)\n            acceleration of the public enterprise liquidation and\n            privatization program to eliminate loss-making enterprises\n            and shield viable enterprises from pressure to finance\n            government deficits. Reforms to support broad-based private\n            sector-led growth include: 1) improving the regulatory\n            environment through revision of investment and labor codes\n            and further price and trade liberalization; and 2)\n            increasing the scope for private activity through\n            privatization and abolition of remaining public monopolies\n            in
