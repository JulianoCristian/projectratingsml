The project\u0092s development\n            objective is to increase mobility of people in the targeted\n            areas and improve the planning and financing of the Road\n            Sector. The project will contribute to the higher level\n            poverty reduction objectives of promoting economic growth\n            and improving living conditions. This is being done by\n            supporting improved management of the roads and\n            infrastructure sectors and reducing the vulnerability of\n            road networks, thus facilitating physical access by the poor\n            to market opportunities and social services. The\n            environmental impacts are expected to be minimal. The social\n            impacts are expected to be positive. The environmental\n            impacts of the upgrading of the rural roads to a stone-paved\n            road are also estimated to be limited. The social impacts\n            will be very positive and contribute to reducing poverty in\n            the area by improving access to markets by local farmers.\n            The negative impacts will occur mainly during the\n            construction period of the road, in particular on the\n            resources of the soil (modification of physical\n            characteristics), on the water resources (pollution of\n            surface and underground waters) and on the atmosphere (dust,\n            smoke, noise). The impacts during the operational period\n            will be very limited and only related to the increment of\n            the road traffic. The project spells out the mitigation\n            measures which will be taken to minimize the impacts, which\n            include a list of the good practices to adopt for the\n            mitigation of the impacts and the control of the environment\n            quality after construction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Elaboration des etudes et projets\n            d'execution pour la rehabilitation de la route\n            Praia-Cidade Velha et routes rurales"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cap-Vert : Deuxi\u00e8me financement\n            compl\u00e9mentaire du Projet d\u2019appui au secteur routier\u00a0: plan\n            de gestion sociale et environnementale : \u00c9laboration des\n            \u00e9tudes et projets d\u2019ex\u00e9cution pour la r\u00e9habilitation de la\n            route Praia-Cidade Velha et routes rurales"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/08/13871147/cape-verde-second-additional-financing-road-sector-support-project-environmental-social-management-plan-elaboration-des-etudes-projets-dexecution-pour-la-rehabilitation-de-la-route-praia-cidade-velha-routes-rurales","projn":"CV-Road Sector Support Project -- P087004,CV-Cape Verde Road Sector Support Project -\n            2nd Additional Financ -- P112767","subtopic":"Rural Roads & Transport,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Roads & Highways,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Rural Transport","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Rural Development,Transport,Conflict and Development","count":"Cabo Verde","authors":{"authr":"Iannello, P."},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110307021738"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Transport,Conflict and Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility, airport, basalt, capacity\n            building, concrete, constraint, core roads, environmental\n            impacts, Financing Source, framework, highways, IBRD,\n            income, Infrastructures, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, land\n            acquisition, Land Use, major roads, mobility, path,\n            political transitions, ports, project design,\n            Rehabilitation, Resettlement, right of way, Road, Road\n            Agency, Road Fund, road management, road network, road\n            networks, Road Sector, roads, rural roads, Safety, secondary\n            roads, social impacts, stone, tracks, Transport, Transport\n            Policy, transport sector, travel time, trip, trip frequency,\n            vehicle, vehicle operating, vehicle operating costs, World Trade"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"E2584","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Republique du Cap Vert - Project\n            d'Appui au Secteur Routier (RSSP) : etude d'impact\n            sur l'environnement"}}},"facets":{}}}
