Lessons\n            of experience are conveyed as follows. The Bank should\n            actively promote the regional landfill model, i.e., multiple\n            municipalities disposing their solid waste in a regional\n            sanitary landfill, managed by companies owned by the\n            municipalities and national government, for replication\n            throughout Montenegro. However, agreeing to a landfill\n            location is a complicated and prolonged process, for which\n            the Bank can be instrumental in helping stakeholders reach a\n            solution that maximizes the benefits. Throughout the\n            process, the Bank should offer its services as an honest\n            broker, but avoid being drawn into the fight that will\n            inevitably occur during the process. Notably, all\n            stakeholders should be involved and consulted extensively,\n            particularly the local communities that will bear most of\n            the costs. The Bank can help reach solutions in its capacity\n            to draw on international independent experts that offer\n            non-biased technical opinions. A consultant credible to all\n            parties, must complete all technical aspects and\n            environmental and social impact assessment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia and Montenegro - Montenegro\n            Environmental Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia and Montenegro -\n            Montenegro Environmental Infrastructure Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5687076/serbia-montenegro-montenegro-environmental-infrastructure-project","projn":"YF-Montenegro Environmental Infrastructure\n            -- P074618","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Solid Waste Management,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Serbia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050324103253"},"subsc":"Solid waste management,Water supply","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aluminum, Bar, coastal areas, collection\n            systems, Construction, construction work, contaminated\n            water, cost effectiveness, drainage, drainage systems, dump\n            sites, dumps, East Europe, environmental benefits,\n            environmental degradation, environmental impact assessment,\n            environmental impacts, Environmental Management,\n            environmental monitoring, Environmental Protection, gas,\n            gases, groundwater, groundwater table, hazardous waste,\n            illegal dumps, industrial waste, jurisdiction, Landfill,\n            landfill design, leachate, legislation, Lessons Learned,\n            municipal water, municipal water supply, NIMBY, PCD,\n            permits, pipes, Pollution, private sector, project\n            identification, project implementation, project preparation,\n            public health, quality of water, recycling, rehabilitation,\n            rubbish, safe water, sanitary disposal, sanitary landfills,\n            social issues, Solid Waste, Solid Waste Disposal, Solid\n            waste management, stabilization, technical advice, Technical\n            Assistance, waste management, Wastewater, Wastewater\n            Treatment, wastewater treatment plants, water contamination,\n            water quality, Water resource, Water resource management,\n            water shortages, water sources, Water Supply, water supply\n            system, wells, World Health Organization"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF030319-FRENCH CTF FOR EXPERTISE FY03 - BALKANS,TF030476-SPANISH CTF - FY04 (ECA WATER,\n            SANITATION, & FLOOD PROTECTION SECTOR),TF030477-GERMAN CTF FY04 - ENVIRONMENT\n            & PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT,TF038814-TURKMENISTAN: WATER SUPPLY AND\n            SANITATION PROJECT,TF050032-FRY-MOTENEGRO: ENVIRONMENTAL\n            INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT,TF052409-SECONDMENT OF XAVIER CHAUVOT DE BEAUCHENE","repnb":"30185"},"24044380":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/24044380/clean-drinking-water-returns-montenegros-zeta-valley","available_in":"English","virt_coll":"Results Profile","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/24044380/clean-drinking-water-returns-montenegros-zeta-valley","new_url":"2004/05/24044380/clean-drinking-water-returns-montenegros-zeta-valley","disclosure_date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-02-24T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-02-24T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/24/000442464_20150224113235/Rendered/INDEX/925650BRI0Box30eturns0to0Montenegro.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/24/000442464_20150224113235/Rendered/PDF/925650BRI0Box30eturns0to0Montenegro.pdf","datestored":"2015-02-24T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-05-26T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Clean drinking water returns to\n            Montenegro's Zeta valley"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The situation spurred Montenegro's\n            authorities to decide to build a new water system, one that\n            will connect the valley with the capital, Podgorica.

supply system; and, 3) support project\n            implementation, through the provision of funds for the\n            completion of engineering services, and for auditing of\n            project

Mitigation measures call for a working plan to deal\n            with key health, safety, and environmental issues, including\n            enforcement of monitoring criteria on quality assurance\n            procedures, compliant with health and safety regulations, in\n            accordance with prevailing environmental legislation.\n            Facilities will be designed to contain wastes, subject to\n            waste inspection, and clearance, thereby undertaking sample\n            testing for final disposal, or processing. Traffic will\n            undergo, as appropriate, a one-way system to avoid\n            congestion.
