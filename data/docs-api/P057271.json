It is widely recognized\n            that damages associated with disasters, such as El Nino,\n            usually reflect either the disaster itself, or cumulative\n            neglect, and deferred maintenance, or weak, ineffective\n            operational, and institutional systems, and framework,\n            respectively. In Guyana, all three factors were present:\n            infrastructure neglect - drainage, irrigation, and potable\n            water systems - occurred even before the impact of El Nino;\n            likewise, operational sector agencies, aggravated by budget\n            constraints, weak capacity, and absence of regulatory\n            enforcement, also had cumulative negative impacts. While the\n            Government made commendable relief, and reconstruction\n            efforts, the lack of resources for appropriate maintenance,\n            institutional, and operational support, will hamper the\n            facilities provided by this credit, and will remain\n            vulnerable to future disasters. Based on the above, lessons\n            reinforce that while the Government appropriately recognized\n            early on the potential impact of the oncoming drought, and\n            took steps in seeking international assistance to dimension\n            the impact, with demonstrated commitment, the existing weak\n            procurement system, prevailed in delaying what otherwise\n            could, and should have helped the contracting process for\n            this (shorter than usual) emergency operation. Likewise, a\n            slow decision-making process, the lack of uniform civil\n            engineering norms, and standards, and weak absorptive\n            capacity, and coordination clearly limited the\n            implementation pace required for a fast, responsive\n            emergency operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - El Nino Emergency Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - El Nino Emergency\n            Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/08/1981818/guyana-el-nino-emergency-assistance-project","projn":"GY-\"El Nino\" Emergency Assistance\n            Project -- P057271","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Sanitation and Sewerage,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Guyana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02082304044625"},"subsc":"Flood protection,Irrigation and drainage,Central government administration,Water supply","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absorptive capacity,Agricultural\n            Production,alternative approach,canals,catchment,Central\n            government,coastal areas,community\n            participation,construction,construction\n            activities,counterpart funding,creeks,Decision Making\n            Processes,distribution systems,Drainage,drainage\n            system,electricity,farmers,Gardens,gravel,hand- dug\n            wells,hand-dug wells,high\n            tide,households,Irrigation,irrigation water,local\n            contractors,maintenance requirements,operational\n            expenses,outfalls,pipe laying,potable\n            water,precipitation,private operator,Project\n            Management,provision of water,Public\n            Works,pumping,pumps,PVC,PVC\n            pipes,rainfall,rainwater,reservoirs,rivers,runoff,sea,service\n            quality,Sewerage,silt,soils,spare parts,storage tanks,urban\n            areas,urban communities,valves,waste,Water Authority,water\n            level,water level recorders,water loss,water needs,water\n            pumps,water scarcity,water service,water services,water\n            source,water sources,Water supply,water system,water\n            systems,Water User,Water Users,Water Users Association,water\n            utilities,well drilling,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"absorptive capacity,Agricultural\n            Production,alternative approach,canals,catchment,Central\n            government,coastal areas,community\n            participation,construction,construction\n            activities,counterpart funding,creeks,Decision Making\n            Processes,distribution systems,Drainage,drainage\n            system,electricity,farmers,Gardens,gravel,hand- dug\n            wells,hand-dug wells,high\n            tide,households,Irrigation,irrigation water,local\n            contractors,maintenance requirements,operational\n            expenses,outfalls,pipe laying,potable\n            water,precipitation,private operator,Project\n            Management,provision of water,Public\n            Works,pumping,pumps,PVC,PVC\n            pipes,rainfall,rainwater,reservoirs,rivers,runoff,sea,service\n            quality,Sewerage,silt,soils,spare parts,storage tanks,urban\n            areas,urban communities,valves,waste,Water Authority,water\n            level,water level recorders,water loss,water needs,water\n            pumps,water scarcity,water service,water services,water\n            source,water sources,Water supply,water system,water\n            systems,Water User,Water Users,Water Users Association,water\n            utilities,well drilling,wells"}},"owner":"Urban (LCSUW)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF040815-GUYANA: EL NINO EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE,TF039751-GUYANA - WATER SUPPLY AND EL\n            NINO EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE.,TF037844-LATIN AMERICA - EL NINIO, PDM\n            II, URB.
