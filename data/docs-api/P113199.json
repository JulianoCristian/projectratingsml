The project\n            included three components: i) block grants disbursements\n            (US$7 million, 87.5 percent) would go towards building or\n            rehabilitating small-scale irrigation projects in the most\n            vulnerable provinces; ii) community facilitation and\n            capacity building (US$600,000, 7.5 percent of total grant\n            funding) would finance Facilitating Partner (FP) costs,\n            including goods, services, and operations costs of NSP FPs;\n            and iii) implementation and management support (US$400,000,\n            5 percent of total grant costs), included both NSP II\n            (National Solidarity Program) Management Support Consultant\n            (MSC) and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development\n            (MRRD) management costs; and comprised incremental expenses\n            incurred in project implementation and management. This\n            included costs of services and operational expenses at the\n            central, regional, and provincial levels. Some lessons\n            learned included: the NSP experience illustrates the vital\n            importance of strong and sustained commitment and vision on\n            the part of key high level Government officials. NSP also\n            illustrates how a national program reaching rural\n            populations in remote parts of the country can help enhance\n            the legitimacy of the government, as findings of the first\n            follow up survey highlight this lesson. Decentralized task\n            teams are essential especially in post-conflict/fragile\n            state situations where continuous and intensive\n            implementation assistance/supervision is needed. It\n            facilitates greater support to communities, expedites\n            sub-project preparation to completion cycle and strengthens\n            project results monitoring on the ground."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Food Crisis Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Food Crisis\n            Response

Crisis\n            Response Project for Afghanistan is to enhance wheat and\n            other cereal production by supporting small scale irrigation\n            at the community level through increase of irrigated land\n            area and capacity building of communities to implement and\n            maintain irrigation sector sub projects that address\n            community needs. The credit grant will help finance\n            approximately 500 small scale, community implemented and\n            maintained irrigation schemes in the provinces most affected\n            by the recent food price increases. This program document\n            seeks financing from the Food Policy Crisis Response (FPCPR)\n            Trust Fund for the Second National Solidarity Program being\n            supported by International Development Association (IDA).\n            One of the priorities of the Food Price Crisis Response\n            (FPCR) resources is to reduce the medium term impacts of the\n            food crisis, and irrigation rehabilitation is an effective\n            way of achieving this. Afghanistan currently imports about\n            20-30 percent of its requirements in a normal year, and can\n            reach 80-90 percent food self-sufficiency in a\n            bumper-harvest year. Therefore, supporting enhancement of\n            local production of wheat will help to ameliorate shortages\n            and help achieve self-sufficiency in normal years.\n            Considering that nearly 70 percent of Afghanistan wheat\n            production comes from irrigated lands where the yields are 2\n            to 4 time higher than rain-fed areas, wheat productivity\n            enhancement program must focus on irrigation improvement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Food Crisis Response Project :\n            additional financing"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Food Crisis\n            Response Project : additional financing"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/07/9731296/afghanistan-food-crisis-response-project-additional-financing","projn":"AF-Food Crisis Response Project -- P113199","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Housing & Human Habitats,Food & Beverage Industry,Irrigation and Drainage","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Water Resources","count":"Afghanistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20080804000212"},"theme":"Rural services and infrastructure","subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Water Resources","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production, Agriculture, animal\n            feed, Animal Husbandry, block grants, capacity building,\n            cereal production, commercial agriculture, community assets,\n            community bank, community demand, Community Development,\n            consumption basket, districts, drinking water, drought,\n            farmers, Food aid, food consumption, food imports, Food\n            insecurity, Food Policy, FOOD PRICE, food prices, food\n            security, food self-sufficiency, food supply, humanitarian\n            assistance, hygiene, impact on poverty, income, irrigated\n            land, irrigation canals, irrigation projects, irrigation\n            rehabilitation, irrigation schemes, irrigation sector,\n            irrigation systems, land acquisition, new communities,\n            Nutrition, opium, opium production, poor, poor farmers,\n            POPPY, poverty levels, poverty line, Poverty rates, Rural,\n            rural access, rural communities, Rural Development, rural\n            infrastructure, Rural Rehabilitation, rural roads, safeguard\n            policies, Safeguards, safety, safety net, sanitation,\n            savings, small scale irrigation, small-scale irrigation,\n            social impacts, technical assistance, vulnerable households,\n            vulnerable people, water user associations, WFP, wheat,\n            wheat flour, wheat production, wheat seed"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"44788"},"facets":{}}}
