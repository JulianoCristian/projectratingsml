This Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) was\n            timed to provide another building block in support of\n            Argentina's ambitious structural reform program, which\n            had been launched by the Menem Administration in the early\n            1990s. The FSAL was designed to consolidate and advance the\n            progress in reforming the financial sector. The success of\n            prior macro and sectoral reforms was predicated on the\n            recovery of private sector investments for which resource\n            mobilization by the banking system represented a major\n            constraint. Decades of high inflation had shrunk the private\n            banking system while encouraging a greater presence of\n            public banks, both federal and provincial. With the\n            strengthened macroeconomic framework, private firms were\n            expanding investments and the FSAL was expected to stimulate\n            the private banking system to increase resource\n            mobilization. Finally, the FSAL was timed to coincide and\n            support Argentina's \"Brady Deal,\" its debt\n            and debt service reduction arrangements. The FSAL's\n            specific objectives were to: (i) reduce the role of the\n            state in the financial sector; (ii) strengthen the banking\n            sector and its supervisory framework; and (iii) provide\n            resources for Argentina's debt and debt service\n            reduction arrangements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Financial Sector Adjustment

Government's ambitious structural adjustment program,\n            and will assist in : (i) reducing the role of the state in\n            the financial sector, (ii) strengthening the banking sector\n            and its supervisory framework, and (iii) providing resources\n            for Argentina's debt and debt service reduction\n            arrangements. The major benefits of the financial sector\n            reform include: (1) a more competitive private banking\n            system which is expected to improve resource mobilization\n            and to increase the efficiency of resource allocation, and\n            (2) fiscal and quasi-fiscal savings as a result of the\n            reduced role of public banks, including the Central
