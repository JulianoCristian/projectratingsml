The lessons learned indicate that previous\n            related investments are a good source of project preparation\n            learning. Stakeholder needs assessment is required to have a\n            robust and consistent project. Strengthening the consulting\n            mechanisms between the Nation and the Provinces would result\n            in a more appropriate assessment of their political\n            willingness and financial health to assume part of the Bank\n            Loans in case of an investment requiring a Provincial Loan.\n            Experimental designs are required to measure developmental\n            impact. The degree of sustainability of the project\n            activities at the participating school at the closing of the\n            project, is a function of the ownership that these school\n            actors displayed with respect to all the learning resources\n            allocated to their schools by the project. The success of\n            this project is largely based on the technical capacity that\n            was built at the national and provincial levels to ensure\n            on-site monitoring and provision of technical assistance to\n            the participating project schools with respect to the\n            appropriate utilization of the learning resources.\n            Dissemination of good practices. A more thorough impact\n            would have been achieved if the delivery of training\n            activities had been better aligned with the provision of\n            learning materials and physical spaces. Ensuring appropriate\n            stakeholder participation in the selection process of\n            learning goods increases the appropriateness of the\n            selection and thus the likelihood for a more effective\n            utilization of these learning goods by beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
