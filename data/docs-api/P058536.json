Project outcomes are\n            downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory from a satisfactory\n            rating on the three loans, and, on the institutional\n            development impact rating, it downgrades to modest the\n            Finance Companies Restructuring Loan; from substantial to\n            modest that of the Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan;\n            yet, concurs on a substantial institutional development\n            impacts for the Second Economic and Financial Adjustment\n            Loan. Finally, mixed reviews are also shown on the Bank and\n            Borrower performances. The main findings from the review of\n            these loans suggest: given that the significant cost of\n            cleansing financial crises can offset progress made over the\n            years in poverty alleviation, and other social improvements,\n            the Bank should continue to play a role in both improving\n            financial sector governance, and soundness to reduce the\n            probability of crisis, as well as in post-crisis management\n            and well-structured recovery. Early underestimates of the\n            severity of the crisis, and the impact of the closure of the\n            finance companies (FCs) on the economy, raised concerns\n            about the credibility of the international financial\n            institutions' approach, and, most important to\n            Thailand's future, about the financial reform itself.\n            This suggests that crises in other countries need to be\n            approached more comprehensively, taking into account\n            potential negative impacts of large scale closures. The\n            audit stipulates short-term crisis management policies can\n            compromise essential structural reforms. The failure to\n            factor in the design of the reforms the inadequacies of the\n            Thai legal, and regulatory infrastructure led to approaches\n            that may have increased the cost of cleanup. Further lessons\n            highlight that sequencing and timing of reforms are crucial;\n            and recommend that succeeding loans with increasingly\n            broader goals, and a growing list of conditions, diffused\n            the focus of reform and meaningful monitoring. A better\n            approach might have been a well-designed programmatic loan,\n            as now being used (but not available at that time), which\n            seeks to develop a set of priority reforms, and sequences\n            the steps for supporting those reforms through successive loans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand -

The following lessons learned derived from\n            interviews with Bank staff, government counterparts, and\n            other stakeholders. 1) It has become clear in countries in\n            financial crisis that a high priority is to pursue\n            legislation that enhances loan collectability. 2) Reform\n            programs should not exceed over tax implementation capacity.\n            3) Achieving legal reform within the framework of emergency\n            lending operations requires two elements: a) dealing with\n            the immediate problems through emergency decrees and b)\n            concretely reforming the legal framework and implementation\n            capacity so that the future need for emergency decrees is\n            reduced. 4) Broader participation in drafting reforms might\n            slow implementation in the short-run, but pays off in the\n            long-run. 5) Bank participation in the legal reform should\n            be broader. 6) Technical assistance, especially grant-funded\n            assistance, is an extremely useful catalyst to implement\n            reform program components. 7) Gaps in the reform program,\n            such as between EFAL II and the planned EFAL III, can have\n            costs. 8) Restructuring is an iterative process. 9) Although\n            poverty estimates were lower than expected, targeting\n            remained an important feature of the fiscal stimulus. 10) In\n            an institution with limited capacity for poverty targeting,\n            the simplest program, that is decentralized, may be the best."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Second Economic and Financial\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Second Economic and\n
