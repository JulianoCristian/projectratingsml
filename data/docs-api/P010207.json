Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, investment lending projects in\n            countries with less developed financial and industrial\n            sectors should be kept simple with a limited number of\n            components. Second, credit lines through DFIs for\n            encouraging industrial investments should avoid putting in\n            micro-management conditionalities, as they may violate\n            normal banking instincts and principles. Third, implementing\n            DFIs should be allowed to charge market rates of interest\n            where a competitive lending environment exists. Lastly,\n            foreign equity participation with management assistance for\n            DFIs in developing countries should be encouraged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Industrial Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal -
