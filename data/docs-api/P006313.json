The project consists of three components: (a) a\n            production component comprising about 250 alcohol units\n            (distilleries and related agricultural facilities) expected\n            to be approved by the Brazilian Government during 1981-83\n            and coming on-stream during 1983-85. These units would\n            provide additional production capacity of about 5.6 billion\n            liters, of which 95% is expected to be sugarcane-based and\n            5% cassava-based. This component would also include units to\n            demonstrate the feasibility of new technology, such as\n            alcohol production from wood; (b) a technology development\n            component to support basic and applied agricultural and\n            industrial research related to production and use of biomass\n            energy; (c) a monitoring and evaluation system to analyze\n            the impact of the Alcohol Program on the agricultural,\n            transport and industrial sectors, rural employment, and the\n            environment, in order to identify any needed corrective\n            measures and facilitate planning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Alcohol and Biomass Energy\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Alcohol and Biomass\n            Energy Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/04/726140/brazil-alcohol-biomass-energy-development-project","projn":"BR-Alcohol & Biomass En -- P006313","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Chemical & Petrochemical Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Montreal Protocol,Transport and Environment,Oil Refining & Gas Industry","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912521461"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acetaldehyde,Acetate,acid,Agricultural\n            Production,Alcohol,alcohol in gasohol,Alcohol\n            Production,Alcohol Program,Anhydrous\n            ethanol,Audits,automotive fleet,automotive fuel,balance of\n            payments,Barrel,benzene,Biomass,carbohydrates,carbon,cellulose,chemical\n            industry,Chemicals,Chloride,co,Coal,combustion,combustion\n            efficiency,conversion efficiency,Crude Oil,crude oil\n            production,Diesel,distillation,distillation\n            column,distilling,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,energy\n            consumption,Engine,engines,environmental\n            problems,enzymes,ethanol,ethanol addition,Ethanol From\n            Sugarcane,ethanol production,Ether,Ethylene,Fuel,Fuel\n            Consumption,fuel injection,Fuel Oil,fuel\n            requirements,fuelwood,Gasohol,Gasoline,gasoline\n            additive,gasoline consumption,Gasoline Demand,Gasoline\n            Gasoline,glucose,heating,hydrogenation,hydrolysis,imports,injection\n            equipment,Interest Rates,Kerosene,Land Use,national\n            energy,nutrients,octane,oil companies,oil imports,oil\n            supplies,oils,Petroleum,petroleum imports,petroleum\n            industry,petroleum prices,Petroleum Product\n            Consumption,petroleum product prices,petroleum\n            products,Petroleum Sector,Production Costs,PRODUCTION\n            TECHNOLOGY,refinery,refinery operations,refining,renewable energy,stream,Vehicle,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"Acetaldehyde,Acetate,acid,Agricultural\n            Production,Alcohol,alcohol in gasohol,Alcohol\n            Production,Alcohol Program,Anhydrous\n            ethanol,Audits,automotive fleet,automotive fuel,balance of\n            payments,Barrel,benzene,Biomass,carbohydrates,carbon,cellulose,chemical\n            industry,Chemicals,Chloride,co,Coal,combustion,combustion\n            efficiency,conversion efficiency,Crude Oil,crude oil\n            production,Diesel,distillation,distillation\n            column,distilling,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,energy\n            consumption,Engine,engines,environmental\n            problems,enzymes,ethanol,ethanol addition,Ethanol From\n            Sugarcane,ethanol production,Ether,Ethylene,Fuel,Fuel\n            Consumption,fuel injection,Fuel Oil,fuel\n            requirements,fuelwood,Gasohol,Gasoline,gasoline\n            additive,gasoline consumption,Gasoline Demand,Gasoline\n            Gasoline,glucose,heating,hydrogenation,hydrolysis,imports,injection\n            equipment,Interest Rates,Kerosene,Land Use,national\n            energy,nutrients,octane,oil companies,oil imports,oil\n            supplies,oils,Petroleum,petroleum imports,petroleum\n            industry,petroleum prices,Petroleum Product\n            Consumption,petroleum product prices,petroleum\n            products,Petroleum Sector,Production Costs,PRODUCTION\n            TECHNOLOGY,refinery,refinery operations,refining,renewable energy,stream,Vehicle,vehicles"}},"owner":"WB Office: Brasilia, Brazil CMU (LCC5C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"3214"},"facets":{}}}
