There are several reasons for\n            this poor outcome. First, Bank preparation and appraisal\n            missions lacked experience. Second, implementation schedules\n            were too ambitious and failed to appreciate the lead-time\n            needed for learning and coaching. Third, tender procedures\n            lacked clarity. Lastly, the Bank's resident office was\n            perceived as having a hands-off attitude in regard to\n            project problems. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            experience. First, project preparation and appraisal\n            missions should consist of persons who possess practical\n            experience in implementing this type of project under the\n            conditions prevailing in countries such as Nepal. Second, it\n            is important to ensure that the facility design corresponds\n            to actual needs. Third, specific attention must be paid to\n            the rules of local tender procedures when they contradict\n            Bank procurement guidelines. Fourth, there should be an\n            adequate analysis of an executing agency's\n            institutional capacity or decision-making authority. Lastly,\n            communications between the Borrower and the Bank were\n            inadequate. In the future, the local Bank office should be\n            used more effectively to reduce problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Grain Storage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Grain Storage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/10/742149/nepal-grain-storage-project","projn":"NP-Grain Storage -- P010149","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Markets and Market Access,Economic Theory & Research,Business in Development,Access to Markets","teratopic":"International Economics and Trade","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925050020"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agro-industry and marketing","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"International Economics and Trade","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,Agriculture,Commerce,consumers,Contractors,cost\n            overruns,Development Assistance,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Expenditure,exports,Financial\n            Statements,inflation,inflation rates,market\n            prices,Marketing,marketing policies,marketing\n            policy,Marketing Services,Marketing Studies,Organizational\n            Structure,price increases,price policy,price\n            stabilization,Procurement,quality\n            control,Reporting,Stocks,storage\n            capacity,Suppliers,surplus,takeover,Technical\n            Assistance,time constraints,underestimates"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,Agriculture,Commerce,consumers,Contractors,cost\n            overruns,Development Assistance,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Expenditure,exports,Financial\n            Statements,inflation,inflation rates,market\n            prices,Marketing,marketing policies,marketing\n            policy,Marketing Services,Marketing Studies,Organizational\n            Structure,price increases,price policy,price\n            stabilization,Procurement,quality\n            control,Reporting,Stocks,storage\n            capacity,Suppliers,surplus,takeover,Technical\n            Assistance,time constraints,underestimates"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"8137"},"723583":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/08/723583/nepal-grain-storage-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/08/723583/nepal-grain-storage-project","new_url":"1980/08/723583/nepal-grain-storage-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/10/14/000178830_98101902360491/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/10/14/000178830_98101902360491/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1062","datestored":"2000-10-14T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1980-08-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Grain Storage Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The proposed project would assist the\n            Government in implementing its foodgrain policies by\n            providing good storage facilities and strengthening NFC and\n            the Rice Export Companies (RECs), so that they may be able\n            to meet foodgrain procurement, distribution and export\n            requirements and reduce quantitative and qualitative storage\n            losses.

The project would\n            consist of: (i) construction of 40,000 MT of bagged grain\n            storage warehouses comprising 37,000 MT storage capacity at\n            eight procurement centers in the Terai and a 3,000 MT\n            transshipment storage facility at Hetauda; (ii) technical\n            assistance for NFC in management and organization, and in\n            finance and accounting, and for NFC and RECs in grain\n            quality control and godown maintenance; (iii) training and\n            study tours for NFC and RECs managers; and (iv) studies on\n            future needs for foodgrain storage and processing facilities\n            and on foodgrain marketing and price policy.
