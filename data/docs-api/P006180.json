Lessons learned from the project are as\n            follows: 1) Structure without a strategy hardly produces the\n            intended results. In this case the Decentralization\n            Administrative Law shows that the lack of a clear and\n            comprehensive strategy led to a faulty situation. 2)\n            Strategies require comprehensiveness in their approach.\n            Without a sustained strategy for the financing of road\n            maintenance, the effect of physical investments is\n            short-lived. The absence of a financing strategy derailed\n            one of the key objectives of the project: the establishment\n            of a sustainable approach for the maintenance of road\n            assets. 3) Incentives for institutional reform must be\n            established from the outset or built into specific progress\n            steps within a project implementation timetable. 4)\n            Procurement must take place immediately after the completion\n            of designs, and designs must be complete, to avoid the\n            frequent situation of recurring to change orders to adjust\n            to changes in the conditions of the project area. The role\n            of transport and the related investments as a\n            countercyclical mechanism for economic growth is critical.\n            As a general lesson, there is a need to strengthen the\n            mechanisms for the internalization of knowledge into\n            implementing institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Second Road Maintenance
