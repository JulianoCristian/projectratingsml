The\n            current difficult political and security circumstances\n            prevailing in Gaza justify continuing the operational\n            assistance to the utility to maintain its services. However,\n            the utility should be encouraged to take further steps to\n            improve its financial standing, invest to improve\n            operational cost recovery, prepare a viable tariff structure\n            and liaise for its approval and implementation. CMWU is\n            currently preparing a strategic plan towards those\n            objectives.
