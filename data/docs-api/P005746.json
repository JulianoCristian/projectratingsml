The project has three\n            components. The first facilitates sector reforms and key\n            actions by defining basic specialties in regional hospitals,\n            which are enabled to use available resources more\n            effectively; and redefines central and regional authority\n            functions and powers; and links these entities with health\n            care providers in the public and private sectors. The second\n            upgrades regional hospitals to improve their function of\n            initial referral and their provision of specialized care for\n            their communities; strengthens national medical emergency\n            services; and develops and implements the national health\n            information system. The third improves the capacity of the\n            health ministry for planning, policy analysis, and financial\n            management; and assists in establishing national health\n            accounts and in improving the ministry's reporting and\n            financial management system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -
