RCIV's main objectives were to: (a) stimulate\n            growth and diversification of agriculture by financing\n            profitable investments by farmers, collectives, state farms,\n            and enterprises; and (b) promote efficiency of rural\n            financial intermediation through introduction of sound,\n            market-oriented, policies and development of main\n            institutions concerned with rural savings mobilization and\n            lending. The Bank's performance was satisfactory, with\n            the exception that it overestimated the scope for certain\n            elements of the financial sector reform program. The\n            Borrower (the Ministry of Finance, MOF) and the Beneficiary\n            did not comply with one of RCIV's core covenants,\n            namely, the elimination of subsidized interest rates on Bank\n            Group funds. The major lessons learned are (1) there is a\n            fairly narrow limit as to how far a Financial Intermediary\n            Loan (FIL) for one banking institution can go in achieving\n            reform objectives for the whole financial sector; (2) when\n            financial sector objectives are introduced into an FIL, all\n            stakeholders must be explicitly involved and exhibit\n            ownership of and commitment to the project objectives; (3)\n            the Bank and Borrower should only develop projects for which\n            there is a strong consensus and common understanding about\n            the main objective of the project, particularly in a complex\n            and sensitive policy area such as financial sector reform;\n            and (4) projects must be kept simple enough that both Bank\n            and implementing agency resources are not stretched beyond\n            capacity to supervise implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Fourth
