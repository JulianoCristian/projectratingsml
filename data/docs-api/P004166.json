The overall objectives of the project were to: (a)\n            increase the access by rural and urban poor to medical care\n            services, especially for early detection of non-communicable\n            diseases (NCDs); (b) improve the quality of medical care in\n            public hospitals (PHs); (c) assist the country in protecting\n            the health of the population through a more effective\n            control of the safety of drugs and the quality of food, and\n            through monitoring NCDs; and (d) address critical health\n            sector policy issues focusing mainly on sector financing and\n            cost containment. Bank performance was generally\n            satisfactory in the preparation of this project. Borrower\n            performance during project preparation was satisfactory. Key\n            lessons that should be noted. The first is that project\n            implementation problems need to be resolved as early as\n            possible in the project's implementation period.  The\n            second lesson is that the project came to realize that\n            continuity problems were often caused by mandatory staff\n            rotation policies. It also found that, to some extent, these\n            problems could be mitigated by mandatory requirements for\n            better communication and cooperation between the outgoing\n            and incoming officers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea- Public Hospital Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea- Public Hospital\n            Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731841/korea--public-hospital-modernization-project","count":"Korea, Republic of","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounts,aging,air,air pollution,audit\n            reports,audits,clinics,communicable diseases,cost\n            containment,Expenditure,expenditures,food additives,health\n            care,health care services,health centers,health\n            expenditures,health indicators,Health Insurance,health\n            policy,health projects,health sector,health services,health\n            system,Hospital Management,hospitals,Impact\n            Evaluation,income,insurers,living standards,medical\n            care,medical insurance,medical insurance coverage,medical\n            services,medical technologies,mortality,Nutrition,outpatient\n            services,patients,Private Sector,Procurement,public\n            hospitals,Public Sector,quality control,quality of\n            care,rural hospitals,safety,service delivery,universal\n            health insurance coverage,urban areas"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounts,aging,air,air pollution,audit\n            reports,audits,clinics,communicable diseases,cost\n            containment,Expenditure,expenditures,food additives,health\n            care,health care services,health centers,health\n            expenditures,health indicators,Health Insurance,health\n            policy,health projects,health sector,health services,health\n            system,Hospital Management,hospitals,Impact\n            Evaluation,income,insurers,living standards,medical\n            care,medical insurance,medical insurance coverage,medical\n            services,medical technologies,mortality,Nutrition,outpatient\n            services,patients,Private Sector,Procurement,public\n            hospitals,Public Sector,quality control,quality of\n            care,rural hospitals,safety,service delivery,universal\n            health insurance coverage,urban areas"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development","projn":"KR-Health Ii -- P004166","topic":"Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621,Hospital Management m1326148 1399,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Public Health Regulation m1326126 2163","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Health Economics & Finance,Business in Development,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3971023103901"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Health","theme":"Health system performance","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Services Delivery m1327294 1305,Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621,Hospital Management m1326148 1399,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Public Health Regulation m1326126 2163","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
