Lessons\n            learned include: fiscal sustainability of rapid expansion of\n            secondary education needs to be reassessed carefully within\n            the realistic context of limited fiscal resources and\n            competing needs of other education subsectors. The\n            unprecedented rate of expansion of community secondary\n            schools is putting extreme pressure on the education budget.\n            In recent years the government responded by reducing per\n            unit resources which in turn compromises the quality of\n            secondary education. Finding the financial resources to\n            complete the job of building quality into the expanded\n            system is an enormous challenge to be resolved by the\n            government and development partners. Rapid expansion of\n            secondary education is more complex and difficult than\n            rapidly expanding primary education. Secondary education\n            systems have subject specialties requiring efficient\n            matching of student class streams and teachers; teacher\n            shortages and lack of capacity limit the ability to increase\n            the number of teachers of appropriate qualifications\n            rapidly; curriculum, textbooks, and examinations need to be\n            reformed simultaneously; and the management challenge\n            inherent in rapid expansion and reform simultaneously would\n            tax even the most capable systems of education. The labor\n            market situation warrants closer and careful monitoring as\n            the supply of secondary school leavers is increasing. There\n            is a risk of creating an increasing pool of unemployed\n            secondary graduates as a consequence of the overly rapid\n            expansion of relatively low quality community secondary schools."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Human Resource Development Pilot\n            Project, Primary Education Development Program Project, and\n            Secondary Education

    follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included:   government ownership and strong\n            political support is essential for program implementation.\n            Involvement of all stakeholders from conception, development\n            and implementation of reforms is also critical to enhance\n            ownership of the reforms at all levels. Communities have a\n            vested interest in education of their children and when\n            given an opportunity, are willing and able to play their\n            part in implementation of education reforms. However, demand\n            from the communities may pressurize the Government to expand\n            even beyond available resources. There is need to pay more\n            attention to developing capacity and ensuring that all the\n            necessary structures are in place if successful\n            implementation of education reforms are to be efficient and\n            cost effective. There was inadequate capacity building\n            during the SEDP launching of implementers at various levels\n            such as for: administrators, school heads, school boards,\n            who in some cases are still not established in some schools,\n            and teachers. Capacity building at all levels, is therefore,\n            indispensable to implementation of reforms and should be\n            ongoing and financed adequately. Decentralization, is a good\n            model for development, because of its ability to\n            institutionalize participation of more stakeholders, and\n            increased accountability. However, its success hinges on\n            adequate communication and development of the requisite\n            capacity of all actors at all levels. This seems to have\n            worked well for the implementation of SEDP, especially given\n            that the decentralization was taking place within the\n            overall decentralization policy of the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Secondary Education Development\n            Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Secondary Education\n

Tanzania Secondary Education Development Program\n            Project discusses potential negative environmental impacts\n            and proposes measures to mitigate them. Expected adverse\n            environmental impacts include: Poor planning may result in\n            poor choice of school location, which ultimately will lead\n            to land degradation and soil erosion, water (surface and\n            ground) contamination, degradation of natural habitats and\n            wetland ecosystems. During construction, poor performance of\n            civil works contractors may leads to unsuccessful\n            incorporation of mitigation measures. Poor implementation of\n            the maintenance plan during operational phases of the public\n            service infrastructure/school may be caused by lack of\n            funds, negligence of staff, or failure to monitor. Adverse\n            social impacts may arise from the absence of a participatory\n            process involving local communities when the government\n            prepares their school development plans; exclusion of\n            vulnerable groups due to barriers to access derived from\n            stigmatization, acute poverty, discrimination, and lack of\n            participation in the
