The termination of\n            the loan was due to amendments made to the Constitution and\n            the Land Acquisition Act in mid 2000, the Government's\n            land reform strategy moved away from land acquisition at\n            market value and the piloting of complementary,\n            community-driven models towards an approach entirely based\n            on compulsory acquisition at below-market value. The\n            Government lost the political will to go through with the\n            community-initiated pilots as the political situation in the\n            country changed drastically due to the emergence of a strong\n            opposition party. The Government argued that it was forced\n            to embark on a more radical approach because while the\n            political pressure to deliver mounted, the donors reneged on\n            the commitments made during the 1998 international donor\n            conference. The weak institutional arrangements, within the\n            Government, for implementing the program were also to blame\n            for the government's failure to meet many of the agreed actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Land Reform Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zimbabwe - Land Reform Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/05/4957936/zimbabwe-land-reform-support-project","projn":"ZW-Land Reform Support Project -- P063096","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Urban Housing,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Housing and Land","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Zimbabwe","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040721093704"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actual costs,Agricultural\n            Development,communities,debt,Exchange\n            Rate,extension,farmers,farms,FISCAL YEAR,households,Land\n            Acquisition,Land Reform,land settlement,market\n            value,NGOs,operating\n            costs,productivity,resettlement,technical assistance"},"1":{"cdata!":"actual costs,Agricultural\n            Development,communities,debt,Exchange\n            Rate,extension,farmers,farms,FISCAL YEAR,households,Land\n            Acquisition,Land Reform,land settlement,market\n            value,NGOs,operating\n            costs,productivity,resettlement,technical assistance"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Learning and Innovation Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"29389"},"437137":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/11/437137/zimbabwe-land-reform-support-project-environmental-analysis-environmental-management-plan","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/11/437137/zimbabwe-land-reform-support-project-environmental-analysis-environmental-management-plan","new_url":"1999/11/437137/zimbabwe-land-reform-support-project-environmental-analysis-environmental-management-plan","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/08/14/000094946_0007210532514/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/08/14/000094946_0007210532514/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"3286","datestored":"2000-08-14T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1999-11-19T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Land Reform Support Project :\n            environmental analysis and environmental management plan"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"It is expected that the Land Reform\n            Support Project will not raise major environmental issues,\n            but rather improve environmental conditions, as communities\n            move from congested areas, to better commercial farming\n            areas, and, because of the small-scale and design simplicity\n            of project community subprojects. Nonetheless, potential\n            environmental effects may result from infrastructure\n            subprojects, which may have negative impacts on soil\n            erosion, water quality, deforestation, and environmental\n            health. This environmental analysis include mitigating\n            measures as follows: 1) soil degradation resulting from\n            water-logging, increased soil salinity and acidity, or\n            erosion, will be minimized by regulating appropriate\n            irrigation schedules, and drainage systems, including\n            sub-surface drainage; adjusting crops to salinity tolerance,\n            and, incorporating irrigation water to reduce sodium\n            content, for disposal into unused land; 2) safe disposal of\n            lubricants, and precautions to contain oil spillage will\n            minimize ground, and water contamination, in addition to a\n            vector ecology assessment; 3) establishment of vegetative\n            cover on eroded surfaces, and of retention ponds to reduce\n            sediment load; and 4) forestry protection of unique\n            biological diversity, through increased number of species\n            planted, including rotation length to minimize\n            susceptibility, and, direct pest, or disease control will be provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Land Reform Support Project :\n            environmental

land reform approaches that show\n            promise to reduce rural poverty and increase agricultural\n            productivity in the participating farms. The project\n            directly benefits an estimated 1000 poor rural families from\n            congested communal areas through improved access to land and\n            direct participation in complementary community investment\n            subprojects. The project has four components. It establishes\n            a land acquisition fund for a community-initiated,\n            market-assisted approach. That is, self-identified\n            communities or community groups of poor households purchase\n            farms with resources from the fund. The second and third\n            components support infrastructure investments through\n            funding subprojects on a matching grant basis, a one-time\n            cash start-up grant, and technical assistance to establish\n            the land settlement and improve land productivity. The\n            fourth component provides technical assistance,\n            institutional support, project administration, and\n            monitoring and evaluation, and possibly includes\n            mobilization assistance for beneficiary communities and\n            rural district councils, specialized skills training,\n            publicity campaigns, and specialized studies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe -
