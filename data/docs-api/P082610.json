Some lessons learned included: for an\n            emergency operation to be effective in a post-conflict\n            environment project design needs to be simple and the goals\n            need to be realistic. It is prudent to plan small, quick\n            operations in a series to apply the lessons learned from\n            previous operations. In these environments, intense Bank\n            supervision is required. Further, using professional agents\n            for essential government functions was essential for\n            success. While the financial management (FM) agent, audit\n            agent, and procurement agents did perform core government\n            functions in this post-conflict environment, an additional\n            agent for disbursements might have helped overcome some of\n            the delays encountered due to lack of capacity,\n            communications difficulties, and unfamiliarity with\n            international procedures. The government needs to continue\n            to engage the services of the advisors for as long as it\n            takes to build sufficient, demonstrable capacity in core\n            public administration areas even as the roles of the\n            advisors become increasingly transitional. A fixed timeframe\n            is not the best measure; the capabilities of the counterpart\n            staff will be determined when the agents are no longer\n            needed. Even as government staff master skills needed, the\n            shifting legal framework for financial management and\n            procurement in Afghanistan is becoming more demanding and\n            poses significant ongoing challenges to the government.\n            Public administration reforms are very difficult and take a\n            long time. The Bank and government need flexibility in\n            dealing with reforms in a fluid environment such as in\n            Afghanistan. Significant mid course adjustments of programs\n            should also be made easier. Similarly, such reforms require\n            strong relationships with government and these relationships\n            need to be broad, and not narrowly focused on ministry of\n            finance (MOF) and one or two key ministers and counterparts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Second Emergency Public\n            Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan -

The Grant will finance the\n            continued employment by the TISA of  qualified firms to\n            assist the authorities in carrying out, on an interim basis,\n            government procurement and selected financial management\n            functions; develop the administration's capacity in\n            these areas; and assess existing systems and procedures to\n            recommend suitable policy reforms. Services will also be\n            provided to assist the Administrative Reform and Civil\n            Service Commission (ARCSC) to develop its capacity to\n            undertake the development and oversight of  merit-based\n            appointments of  senior civil servants and appeals, civil\n            service management, and overall management and\n            implementation of  public administration reform program.\n            Further services will be provided to ministries for approved\n            restructuring, and for studies and institution building\n            within selected entities. It builds on lessons in other\n            post-conflict countries where procurement and fiduciary\n            weaknesses have delayed reconstruction programs and put in\n            jeopardy the continued high level of  donor support that is needed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Second Emergency Public\n            Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Second Emergency\n            Public Administration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2368703/afghanistan-second-emergency-public-administration-project","projn":"AF-Emergency Public Administration Project\n            II -- P082610","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Business Environment,Business in Development,National Governance,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Afghanistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20030605112743"},"subsc":"General public administration sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Account,accountability,accounting,accounts,ADB,Administrative\n            Reform,Administrative Reforms,administrative\n            systems,auditors,audits,Authority,authorization,autonomy,budget\n            process,budgetary support,business community,central\n            Government,Civil\n            Service,contractors,decree,districts,employment,execution,expenditure,expenditures,external\n            auditors,feasibility studies,financial management,financial\n            sector,financial statements,financial support,FISCAL,Fiscal\n            policy,FISCAL YEAR,government departments,government\n            officials,government structures,inflation,laws,management\n            reports,managers,media,Ministry of\n            Finance,nutrition,payroll,political\n            control,Presidency,private sector,procurement,Public\n            Administration,public administration reform,public\n            resources,public sector,public sector management,public\n            services,public support,reporting,retail banking,revenue\n            mobilization,Social Capital,social protection,state\n            control,technical assistance,transparency,Transport"},"1":{"cdata!":"Account,accountability,accounting,accounts,ADB,Administrative\n            Reform,Administrative Reforms,administrative\n            systems,auditors,audits,Authority,authorization,autonomy,budget\n            process,budgetary support,business community,central\n            Government,Civil\n            Service,contractors,decree,districts,employment,execution,expenditure,expenditures,external\n            auditors,feasibility studies,financial management,financial\n            sector,financial statements,financial support,FISCAL,Fiscal\n            policy,FISCAL YEAR,government departments,government\n            officials,government structures,inflation,laws,management\n            reports,managers,media,Ministry of\n            Finance,nutrition,payroll,political\n            control,Presidency,private sector,procurement,Public\n            Administration,public administration reform,public\n            resources,public sector,public sector management,public\n            services,public support,reporting,retail banking,revenue\n            mobilization,Social Capital,social protection,state\n            control,technical assistance,transparency,Transport"}},"owner":"Econ.
