Lessons reinforce the notion that government\n            commitment to, and ownership of a reform program, as in this\n            case, is conducive to successful results. But as experience\n            suggests, the implementation of a comprehensive reform\n            approach, requires a consistent, and correct sequence of\n            enterprise, and financial sector reform, to avoid, as\n            mentioned above, an erroneous timing which may hamper\n            financial sustainability. Nonetheless, the macroeconomic\n            stability of the Kyrgyz Republic, paved the way to reduced\n            volatility of capital flows, and enhanced the potential for\n            safe financial management, which was instrumental in\n            attracting investments, and facilitated credit risk\n            management. To finalize, strong financial systems require\n            enforcement powers, thus effective banking regulation, and\n            preventive early-warning systems, and instruments for\n            depositors protection, should be in place for effective\n            on-site examination, and off-site surveillance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Financial Sector\n            Adjustment

         increased production and capacity utilization through the\n            provision of foreign exchange resources to finance imports\n            of inputs, raw materials, spare parts and services; 2)\n            create a competitive, sound and efficient banking system; 3)\n            improve public confidence in financial institutions; 4)\n            foster a health adjustment and renewed growth in the\n            financial sector, which will contribute to the\n            government's stabilization objectives; 5) encourage the\n            development of sound contractual savings organizations; and\n            6) develop technical capacity in banking and financial\n            management and reinforce the implementation of the\n            country's reform program as a whole.  The components of\n            the projects are the following: 1) creation of a policy and\n            regulatory environment conducive to the sound growth of a\n            competitive and efficient private banking system; 2)\n            liquidation of the two dominant and insolvent state-owned\n            banks: Agroprombank and Elbank; 3) downsizing and financial\n            restructuring through private re-capitalization of two large\n            and insolvent former state banks: Promstroi and AKB\n            Kyrgyzstan Banks; 4) creation of a temporary Debt Resolution\n            Agency to help collect, restructure, sell or write-off the\n            old non-performing loans, and thus accelerate enterprise\n            restructuring or liquidation in the process; and 5) creation\n            of a regulatory and supervisory framework, and supporting\n            policies and infrastructure, for the development and growth\n            of emerging non-bank financial institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Financial\n            Sector
