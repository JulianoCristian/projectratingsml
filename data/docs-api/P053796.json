The performances of the Borrower and the Bank are\n            rated satisfactory. Several lessons were cited: 1) A quick\n            and measured Bank response to recovery and reconstruction\n            after a natural disaster is necessary to provide meaningful\n            help to countries and affected people and for building a\n            longer term relationship with the Government. The Government\n            in this project appreciated the Bank's role in\n            coordinating flood recovery efforts and support during\n            project implementation. It resulted in a long-term\n            relationship in the flood sector leading to a broader\n            program in providing flood protection in the Odra River\n            Basin; 2) The emergency recovery project should not be\n            limited to restoration efforts only. In its design, due\n            consideration should be given to longer term perspective and\n            causes of these disasters. The project may include\n            appropriate measures and plans for reduction of hazards and\n            protection against recurrence of such disasters in future.\n            Component B addressing flood hazard reduction and planning\n            under this project served the most useful purpose in this\n            regard. 3) The implementation period of an emergency\n            recovery project should not be limited to three years.\n            Instead, the implementation period should be determined by\n            the scope and scale of restoration works, complexities\n            involved and capacity of the country and implementing\n            agencies. 4)  To the extent possible, funds from development\n            partners/financiers should be pooled together and disbursed\n            using a simplified/unified procurement and disbursement\n            procedures in order to speed up the implementation of\n            recovery efforts and their completion in a timely manner. 5)\n            Contract packaging and procurement planning is extremely\n            crucial for early startup and timely implementation of the\n            project. To the extent possible, works should be packaged\n            into large contracts attracting qualified contractors and\n            reducing the time required for contract management. 6) The\n            implementation of sophisticated weather/flood forecasting\n            systems should be done through contracts for integrated\n            systems based on final functionality instead of installation\n            of subcomponents of the system and then integrating them in\n            to functional systems. The technical and coordination\n            consultants to the Institute of Meteorology and Water\n            Management played a crucial role in the installation of\n            SMOK, without their technical assistance completion of SMOK\n            may not been possible. An enhanced role of the technical\n            consultants in preparing specifications and construction\n            supervision would have made implementation of SMOK faster\n            and smoother."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
