This project confirms lessons from previous\n            similar experience, regarding: 1) reaching agreement with\n            beneficiaries on a consistent cost and fees setting\n            mechanism to ensure the economic viability of social\n            infrastructures; 2) to ensure ability to pay services and\n            fees among villagers, the promotion of income generating\n            activities, that would create growth and increase household\n            (thus, as a consequence community) financial resources, has\n            to accompany the provision of social infrastructures; 3)\n            training should be delivered in a more professional manner\n            by mobilizing training institutes and using training\n            modules; 4) communities have to be the main actors--through\n            a learning-by-doing process, accompanied by sound training\n            programs, and close follow-up by partners; and 5) the\n            preparation nearly took three years but was a key element of\n            success through: identification of targeted villages,\n            piloting of intervention modalities, assessment of NGOs\n            capacity and elaboration of a training action plan,\n            preparation of community capacity building programs (tools,\n            content and implementation modalities).

priority needs;\n            and in partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            and local authorities, to plan, implement, and supervise\n            actions to respond to those needs; and iii) strengthen\n            institutional and policy-making capacity at the local and\n            national levels in the fight against hunger and poverty. The\n            project has two components: a) Community development will\n            include training for the community and for the NGOs\n            recruited for community development activities; an\n            information, Education, Communication (IEC) program tailored\n            to community needs; and an information campaign to keep the\n            public abreast of project development. b) Policy and\n            institutional development will strengthen local and national\n            decision-making on poverty issues. This component will\n            finance the activities of the Observatory for Sustainable\n            Human Development, created to provide policy-makers with\n            information on poverty issues.
