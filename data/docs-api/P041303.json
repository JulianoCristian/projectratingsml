through measures to regenerate productive capacity\n            in crop and livestock production, improve rural roads and\n            potable water supply which while generating current income\n            for the affected populations, will also strengthen the\n            capacity of the government to mitigate the impact of future\n            droughts; and 2) assist in enhancing institutional capacity\n            for drought management. The project will be targeted to\n            rural areas, particularly in the north and west, where the\n            drought is most severe. The project components are: 1)\n            agricultural inputs; 2) livestock production; 3) water; 4)\n            rural roads; and 5) improving future drought preparedness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Emergency Drought Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Emergency Drought\n            Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/08/732649/morocco-emergency-drought-recovery-project","projn":"MA-Emerg.
