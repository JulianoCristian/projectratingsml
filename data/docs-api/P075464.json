Some lessons learned includes: even though\n            the project was designed to operate within the framework of\n            the Department of Health (DOH), which used a programmatic\n            approach and Sector Development Approach for Health (SDAH);\n            and within these financed a selection of priority national\n            elements which were ready for implementation, it should be\n            noted that the project design lacked flexibility, which made\n            it a relatively inflexible sector budget support operation.\n            Budget support operations provide a unique opportunity to\n            link policy dialogue with enhanced lending. The project\n            suffered from weaknesses in Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) at all stages-design, implementation, and\n            utilization. Efforts to identify methods for how to track\n            the progress of certain objectives and targets were\n            inadequate. While Bank projects are implemented solely by\n            the Borrower, the Bank team can leverage good results\n            through high-quality, strong, and dynamic technical support\n            provided to the Borrower. The Bank has demonstrated the\n            value of international 'good practices' by\n            bringing a successful experience from the social protection\n            sector in Latin America to
