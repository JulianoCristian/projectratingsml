An important aspect of the proposed loan of US$40\n            million are the arrangements for technical assistance\n            intended to upgrade the project appraisal and supervision\n            capabilities of Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD),\n            the borrower and administrator of the loan. Although this\n            first loan to BAD will be confined essentially to the\n            financing of construction materials industries, the Algerian\n            authorities expect that, over time, the experience acquired\n            by BAD's unit in appraising and supervising a number of\n            medium-sized projects will set a pattern for BAD in most of\n            its future operations, whatever their nature and sources of\n            funding. Progress should gradually enable BAD to assume a\n            stronger role in the Algerian investment-decision process.\n            Whether this approach will work, particularly whether\n

mainly in the construction materials\n            sector. An important aspect of the proposed loan of US$40\n            million are the arrangements for technical assistance\n            intended to upgrade the project appraisal and supervision\n            capabilities of Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD),\n            the borrower and administrator of the loan. Although this\n            first loan to BAD will be confined essentially to the\n            financing of construction materials industries, the Algerian\n            authorities expect that, over time, the experience acquired\n            by BAD's unit in appraising and supervising a number of\n            medium-sized projects will set a pattern for BAD in most of\n            its future operations, whatever their nature and sources of\n            funding. Progress should gradually enable BAD to assume a\n            stronger role in the Algerian investment-decision process.\n            Whether this approach will work, particularly whether\n            BAD's new working tools will carry weight is the\n            essential risk in this operation which has considerable\n            attributes of an experiment in the Algerian context."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algerie - Evaluation D'un Projet de\n            Credit Industriel a la Banque Algerienne de Developpement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Alg\u00e9rie \u2013 Projet de cr\u00e9dit pour\n            l\u2019industrie : Alg\u00e9rie\u00a0- \u00c9valuation d\u2019un projet de cr\u00e9dit\n            industriel \u00e0 la Banque Alg\u00e9rienne de D\u00e9veloppement"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1975/06/11768651/algeria-industrial-credit-project-algerie-evaluation-dun-projet-de-credit-industriel-la-banque-algerienne-de-developpement","projn":"DZ-Dfc I-268861 -- P004881","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,National Governance","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Governance,Urban Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100210024017"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Governance,Urban Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Construction materials; Industrial credit;\n            Investment; Project appraisal; Projects,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Construction materials; Industrial credit;\n            Investment; Project appraisal; Projects,,"}},"owner":"Private Sector Dev & Finance Grp (MNSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"782","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Algerie - Evaluation D'un Projet de\n            Credit Industriel a la Banque Algerienne de Developpement"}}},"facets":{}}}
