The project was identified by the\n            Government and the Bank in February 1998, and was prepared\n            at the Government's request. It was appraised in June\n            1998, and negotiations took place in August 1998. A Specific\n            Investment Loan for US$44 million was approved by the Board\n            on May 27, 1999. Following Board Approval in May 1999, loan\n            signing was delayed as a result of the fiscal crisis in\n            Brazil. On April 17, 2001, with the Loan Agreement still\n            unsigned, the Bank formally notified the Ministry of\n            Agriculture and Supply (MAS) that, given 23 months had\n            elapsed since Board approval, the Bank would establish April\n            30, 2001, as the final date for which Loan signing could\n            take place. In the absence of loan signing by this date, the\n            Bank would cancel the operation, and withdraw the loan. As\n            signing did not take place by this date, on August 1, 2001,\n            the Bank formally notified the Government of Brazil that the\n            loan was canceled."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Animal and Plant Health Protection Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Animal and Plant Health\n            Protection Project  : Brazil - Animal and Plant Health\n            Protection Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/6067698/brazil-animal-plant-health-protection-project-brazil-animal-plant-health-protection-project","projn":"BR-Animal & Plant Health Protection\n            Project -- P055388","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20050715123812"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Animal production,Sub-national government administration,Crops,Central government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, authorization, Borrower,\n            execution, Federal Government, FISCAL, fiscal crisis,\n            livestock, LOAN, Loan Agreement, Loan effectiveness,\n            Ministry of Finance, plant diseases, PLANT HEALTH, PLANT\n            HEALTH PROTECTION, private sector, private sector\n            participation, Project Appraisal Document, public sector,\n            Ministry of Agriculture; Socially Sustainable Development,\n            state modernization, trade barriers"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"32368"},"441016":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/05/441016/brazil-animal-plant-health-protection-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/05/441016/brazil-animal-plant-health-protection-project","new_url":"1999/05/441016/brazil-animal-plant-health-protection-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/14/000094946_99060411143057/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/14/000094946_99060411143057/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"4480","docdt":"1999-05-06T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1999-09-14T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Animal and Plant Health Protection Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Animal and Plant Health Protection\n            Project aims to increase Brazil's competitiveness and\n            productivity in its agricultural and livestock sectors.
