However, both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated as\n            moderately satisfactory, given the failure to secure\n            government support to quality interventions, causing\n            unnecessary delays in implementation, and, due to\n            performance difficulties in financial, legal, and activities\n            of the Social Investment Fund, respectively. Lessons\n            highlight the need to establish early on, an evaluation\n            baseline; the importance of focusing on the pedagogical\n            aspects of the project; the need to translate the concept of\n            municipal education, and institutional school improvement\n            plans as defined by legislation, into operational\n            instruments; the need for adequate financial resources; and,\n            the importance of working directly with local authorities.\n            Moreover, lessons demonstrated the potential effectiveness\n            of demand-side subsidies, showing increased coverage, and\n            improved equity through the private sector, without reducing\n            quality. And, the increased awareness of the importance of\n            education, translated into increased investments for the\n            sector, i.e., government agencies, and municipalities alike\n            consider education a high priority in their development\n            plans.

- Secondary Education Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Secondary\n            Education Project are to support government initiatives\n            designed to:  (a) implement a new national government\n            strategy of cofinancing investments in education with the\n            departments and municipalities; (b) provide incentives to\n            regional and local governments to achieve national\n            educational development targets; and (c) support the\n            assumption by municipalities of an expanded role in\n            education by building local capacity for the planning,\n            co-financing, and execution of investments.  The project\n            comprises four main components designed to provide\n            participating municipalities with the assistance needed to\n            implement their education plans and investment programs for\n            secondary education development.  In order to receive\n            project support, each municipality would be required to\n            prepare a Municipal Education Plan (MEP) with sub-projects.\n            Provision for the funding of municipal secondary education\n            development plans and the National Ministry of Education\n            (MEN) initiatives in support of secondary education is made\n            under the following project components.  Increasing\n            Coverage:  a program providing grants and loans to local\n            governments to help them fund new school construction and\n            the rehabilitation of an estimated 50 percent of some 1,250\n            public school facilities and equipment. Expanding Access:\n            an education vouchers program providing 55,000 vouchers to\n            give low income students the choice of attending private\n            schools with excess capacity where public school places are\n            not available. Educational Quality Enhancement:  a program\n            to upgrade educational quality, including funding for School\n            Improvement Plans (SIP) to encourage principals and teachers\n            to diagnose their school and formulate programs to improve\n            school quality and efficiency, in-service training for\n            principals and teachers and provision of 4.2 million\n            textbooks and instructional materials.  Finally, Management\n            and Institutional Strengthening:  the project will:  (a)\n            provide management and institutional strengthening in the\n            departments and municipalities and in MEN, based on the\n            adoption of a plan prepared by MEN for implementing the\n            decentralization of education; (b) improve quality and\n            reliability of educational statistics; (c) assist MEN in\n            conducting national assessments of student achievement in\n            math and reading at the secondary school level; and (d)\n            conduct policy and evaluation research."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Secondary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Secondary Education
