Key lessons learned from the project\n            concerned bank supervision, project design and management,\n            staff development, and instructional reform.  They are as\n            follows: 1. Project implementation can be negatively\n            affected if Bank supervision is not maintained in a timely\n            and consistent manner. 2. Effective Bank supervision\n            requires coupling experienced task managers with adequate\n            staffing on the ground. 3. To quickly identify and address\n            supervision problems before they affect project\n            implementation, the supervision team should be supported by\n            a well informed, proactive management structure, including a\n            Country Operations Manager with front-line responsibility\n            for service quality. 4. Use regularly scheduled portfolio\n            reviews for increased quality control of Bank supervision\n            activities. 5. Make available an extended team of project\n            implementation specialists (procurement, financial\n            management, ICT development, etc.) to support the task\n            manager in resolving supervision problems. 6. Establish an\n            effective implementation unit with adequate numbers of\n            qualified staff experienced in supervising civil works,\n            equipment procurement, staff training, financial management,\n            and monitoring and evaluation for timely planning,\n            implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of project\n            activities. 7. Maintain the project manager for the duration\n            of the project to ensure management continuity and involve\n            him in project design, staff appointments, and initial\n            training of project staff. 8. Positive and consistent\n            support for the implementation unit from top-level education\n            ministry officials is essential. 9. The training in logical\n            framework strategies enabled the Educational Service Areas,\n            project institution coordinators, and teachers to\n            meaningfully participate in project implementation. Other\n            lessons concerned establishing and operating an effective\n            monitoring and evaluation for accurate progress reporting on\n            quantitative and qualitative achievements at dispersed\n            sites; adapting apt criteria for selecting candidates for\n            overseas fellowships and short-term training, and providing\n            translations at training courses in science research and use\n            of advanced equipment; ensuring that the local provider does\n            not infringe on international copyright laws; involving\n            local university personnel to train staff in integrating ICT\n            with the curriculum and instructional materials preparation;\n            avoiding delays in procurement and disbursement by reducing\n            differences between the Bank's and the\n            Government's regulations; using vertical integration\n            between institutions (e.g. universities, secondary schools)\n            within a single subsector for effective institutional\n            reform; and the need to shift from teacher-centered to\n            student-centered teaching/learning methodology to improve\n            student learning and retention; and improve secondary\n            teachers' ability/opportunity to use ICTs in their classrooms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand -
