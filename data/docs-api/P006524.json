Lessons point at the importance of\n            strong, stable relationships between the Bank, and Borrower,\n            a problem issue which in this case, can be attributed to\n            early changes in the implementing unit's leadership, as\n            well as shifting government priorities. Likewise, successive\n            changes in Bank supervision leadership, also meant forging\n            new relationships, and accommodating to management styles,\n            endangering project success, which could have adversely\n            impacted project outcomes, despite a sound project\n            preparation. Additionally, while the project included\n            relevant indicators, it did not incorporate easy to measure\n            key performance indicators, that could have guided the\n            decision-making process during implementation, and, this\n            factor highlights in turn the need to have in place a good\n            project management information system, prior to project\n            effectiveness. Moreover, Bank supervision teams should\n            include members with sectoral experience, in water supply\n            and sanitation projects in this case, a coordination that\n            would have ensured not only the quality of infrastructure\n            investments, but enhanced supervision as well. It is finally\n            suggested that focusing on a few, strategic municipalities\n            for institutional development, may be the approach for\n            including such objectives in municipal development funds\n            projects, as well as the use of matching grants, as opposed\n            to loans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Minas Gerais Municipal Development
