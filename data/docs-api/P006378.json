The lessons indicate how an\n            optimized network rehabilitation, and maintenance strategy,\n            can effectively re-instate an entire road network into\n            satisfactory conditions, over a period of just a few years,\n            and at reasonable costs, as demonstrated in Santa Catarina.\n            It is suggested that a proactive supervision, and project\n            restructuring, if critical assumptions have changed (the\n            funding capacities of the states were converted following\n            the establishment of the stabilization program), are\n            essential ingredients to achieve development objectives. The\n            increase of the Bank's cost-share for civil works, from\n            50 percent to 75 percent, drastically improved the\n            attractiveness of the loans, hence, consideration for\n            offering better cost-sharing arrangements, should be taken\n            into account. While grouping similar sub-projects under one\n            \"umbrella\" project can lead to savings at the\n            project processing stage, the very few economies of scale in\n            supervision, renders appraisal, and completion stages so\n            difficult, that it is therefore suggested that each\n            sub-project be adequately, and separately funded, to allow\n            for effective supervision, and include civil works'\n            field visits as well."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

The\n            project will help to check the deterioration of the state\n            road networks and improve their condition. The project\n            consists of two similar subprojects in the borrower states.\n            Each subproject will include: (a) a policy and institutional\n            development program to: (i) prepare and annually update the\n            state's pluriannual and annual road expenditure and\n            funding programs, consistent with agreed priorities and\n            targets; (ii) develop and implement a pavement management\n            system to help prepare and monitor appropriate road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance strategies and programs;\n            (iii) strengthen the State Roads Department's\n            (DER's) contract and project management systems; and\n            (iv) develop appropriate capability in the DER and in the\n            state government to implement and monitor environmental\n            standards and guidelines for state roads; and (b) an\n            investment and maintenance program consisting of the\n            rehabilitation, resurfacing and routine maintenance\n            components of the state's 1992-96 road program. The two\n            subprojects combined will include about 950 km of\n            rehabilitation and 1,400 km of resurfacing works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - State Highway Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - State Highway Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/12/722702/brazil-state-highway-management-project","projn":"BR-State Hwy Mgmt -- P006378","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Business Environment,National Governance,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961002094324"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accounts,administrative\n            capacity,administrative systems,allocation of\n            resources,authorization,budgetary funds,budgetary\n            resources,budgeting,Cement,Constitution,contractors,cost\n            estimates,decentralization,decision-makers,economic\n            growth,economic\n            stability,execution,expenditure,expenditures,Federal\n            Government,feeder roads,FISCAL,framework,highway\n            maintenance,highway networks,highway\n            projects,highways,impact analyses,institutional\n            development,municipalities,National\n            Roads,passenger,Pavement,Pavement Management,Pavement\n            Management System,paving,PMS,Private\n            Sector,procurement,public agency,public resources,public\n            sector,quarrying,rate of return,representatives,resource\n            allocation,resurfacing,road deterioration,road networks,road\n            rehabilitation,road transport,Roads,routine\n            maintenance,state agencies,State Government,state\n            resources,Transport,urban traffic"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accounts,administrative\n            capacity,administrative systems,allocation of\n            resources,authorization,budgetary funds,budgetary\n            resources,budgeting,Cement,Constitution,contractors,cost\n            estimates,decentralization,decision-makers,economic\n            growth,economic\n            stability,execution,expenditure,expenditures,Federal\n            Government,feeder roads,FISCAL,framework,highway\n            maintenance,highway networks,highway\n            projects,highways,impact analyses,institutional\n            development,municipalities,National\n            Roads,passenger,Pavement,Pavement Management,Pavement\n            Management System,paving,PMS,Private\n            Sector,procurement,public agency,public resources,public\n            sector,quarrying,rate of return,representatives,resource\n            allocation,resurfacing,road deterioration,road networks,road\n            rehabilitation,road transport,Roads,routine\n            maintenance,state agencies,State Government,state\n            resources,Transport,urban traffic"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF026970-STATE HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT PROJECT","repnb":"P5733"},"facets":{}}}
