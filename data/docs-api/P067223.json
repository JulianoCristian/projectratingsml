The high level committee staffed by\n            technical experts was established at the outset of the\n            reform program. It proved essential to the formulation and\n            effective implementation of the reforms. A more focused\n            adjustment operation also allows more focused effort and\n            attention on specific areas so that more ambitious reforms\n            are possible. The Croatia SAL, unlike many adjustment\n            operations, did not attempt to address structural problems\n            at once across all major economic sectors. This strategy\n            meant that pressure could be concentrated on politically\n            difficult reforms like labor market flexibility. The\n            especially close coordination of the Bank and the Fund\n            helped design and fulfill a bold reform program. The\n            combined financial resources of the two institutions and the\n            overlapping conditionality gave strong leverage to the\n            reform program, which government officials reported was a\n            key factor in the program's success. Local consultants\n            have good standing among government counterparts and could\n            be used more widely in Bank operations. The Bank learned in\n            some components (e.g. Social Protection) that local\n            consultants are highly capable and more knowledgeable about\n            local conditions. Government counterparts also appreciated\n            working with them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Structural

program to foster rapid, and sustainable\n            economic growth, through macroeconomic stabilization,\n            towards integration into the European Union (EU). The reform\n            program is designed to attain these goals, through improved\n            economic management, and coordination of economic\n            policymaking, and, by enhancing fiscal discipline, so as to\n            strengthen market institutions, and competitiveness, and in\n            addition, will also enhance labor market flexibility, and\n            strengthen social protection. Measures for improved budget\n            procedures, reduction or elimination of subsidies, and\n            monitoring of Government guarantees, and reforms in the\n            pension system, will enhance fiscal discipline, while\n            reforms in the competition policy, and improvement of\n            institutional capacity for resolving business disputes, and\n            bankruptcy proceedings, will be supported. Social safety\n            nets will target vulnerable groups, aiming at improved cost\n            effectiveness of social assistance, and community-based\n            social services. However, the retrenchment of the wage bill,\n            and reductions in public employment pose risks if not\n            attained, and, containing health fund expenditures could\n            force the Government to resort to additional foreign\n            borrowing. These could undermine the credibility of fiscal\n            adjustment, while the slowdown in the world economy (i.e.,\n            economic effects of the terrorist events in the US) could\n            destabilize both Croatia's EU integration, and capital\n            flows, exacerbated by the coalition Government's\n            political risks, which could undermine reforms, and policy
