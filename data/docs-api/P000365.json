The\n            objectives, as stated in the SAR, appeared realistic amid\n            the assessment prevailing at appraisal on the macro-economic\n            prospects, i.e. regarding availability of counterpart funds.\n            However, the economic and financial crisis revealed that\n            this assessment was not justified. The Project failed to\n            achieve most of its objectives: The Sector policies,\n            financial objectives and the institutional development had\n            negligible achievement, whereas the physical objectives were\n            only partially achieved. In addition the project was\n            unsustainable and the institutional development component of\n            the Project was not implemented. The Bank's performance\n            as well as the borrower\u0092s performance were rated deficient.\n            In general, the outcome is rated highly unsatisfactory. Key\n            Lessons Learned: (a) Project Context: Bank assistance\n            strategy and operations should be based on a sector-wide\n            analysis to determine priorities and reforms which would\n            prevent some sub-sectors from undermining efforts elsewhere,\n            especially in a deteriorating or weak economy, when\n            resources are scarce; (b) Road Maintenance Organization:\n            When the sector lacks strong leadership and commitment to\n            efficiency and accountability, the role of the institution\n            in charge of road maintenance needs to be concentrated on\n            planning, programming, budgeting and supervising road\n            maintenance works; (c) Project Design and Implementation: To\n            continue in a direction which has become inappropriate is\n            likely to result in poor implementation and performance and\n            lack of achievement of the Project objectives; and (d)\n            Technical Assistance, Capacity Building and Human Resource\n            Development: Technical assistance should not substitute for\n            local staff, and should be provided in an environment which\n            is committed to building on the expertise thus provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
