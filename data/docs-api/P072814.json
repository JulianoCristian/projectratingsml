The experience of the project confirmed\n            the efficiency of social funds mechanisms, in improving\n            living conditions of the poor through the construction of\n            small-scale infrastructure, and in building social capital.\n            It also confirmed that trust fund grants can serve as entry\n            points in jurisdictions which are not Bank members, and its\n            standard resources cannot be deployed. They can set the\n            stage for follow-up operations, by setting institutional\n            capabilities, and rules on activities requiring greater\n            funding. In this fashion, relatively small grants can assume\n            the front-end risk in uncertain circumstances, as well as\n            provide bridge funds until larger support can be obtained.\n            In addition it demonstrated the benefits of a\n            community-based project, serving as a catalyst for a process\n            participation. Nonetheless, the Community Development Fund\n            (CDF) problems in the water supply and sewerage sector,\n            suggest a need for particular provisions for social fund\n            activity, in areas where special expertise is required to\n            achieve success. Another point for Bank project design,\n            concerns CDF's belief that its operating manual was\n            seemingly ineffective, and therefore had to be revised.\n            Concerns further include the uncertainty, and limited\n            existence of these funds, the longer term establishment of\n            CDF under the exigencies of post-conflict\n            \"emergency\" conditions, and, considerations on the\n            uncertainty of the roles of different government\n            institutions in Kosovo."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia & Montenegro - Kosovo Community\n
