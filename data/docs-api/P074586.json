The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            adjudged satisfactory. These are some of the lessons\n            learned: 1) During project formulation, there was a serious\n            debate about the structure of the credit. With the evolution\n            of the political structure of the FRY, it was not clear what\n            role the Federal Government or the Republic of Serbia would\n            play. Because nearly all of the reforms were to be\n            implemented by the Republic of Serbia, it was decided to\n            target the Credit to the Republic of Serbia, with FRY\n            primarily playing the role of a borrower which would pass\n            through the counterpart funds to the Republic of Serbia.\n            Thus, the role of the FRY was, owing to the institutional\n            structure, minimal. In general, the Bank should engage the\n            level of government which will be in charge of formulating\n            and implementing reforms, and, if for legal reasons, another\n            level of government needs to be involved in borrowing, this\n            role should be kept to the minimum necessary to convey\n            funding to the operationally relevant level of government.\n            This, especially in cases where the \"central\"\n            government is withdrawing from managing the constituent\n            republics.  2) Coherence and credibility are important for\n            adjustment operations. While this is true for all adjustment\n            operations, it is especially true for operations such as\n            this SAC which help initiate adjustment lending to a country\n            where the political landscape itself is changing with\n            evolving governmental relationships and a new public\n            attitude towards economic reform. Combining a few important\n            fiscal issues with a broader institutional reform program\n            lends coherence and credibility to such an adjustment\n            operation. The fiscal and quasi-fiscal impact of the SAC\n            were essential for its adjustment focus, while, at the same\n            time, the new Serbian Government benefited from the detailed\n            program for the sectors. 3) Reform implementation is heavily\n            dependent on an effective champion. In both the energy and\n            health sectors, SAC reforms were delayed because of\n            ministerial changes, and only when the new ministers were\n            appointed could the program proceed. 4) The Country Economic\n            Memorandum, \"Breaking with the Past\" helped\n            government to focus on key reforms, and enabled government\n            and the Bank to work together on defining sectors to be\n            included in the SAC, and the key issues which needed to be\n            addressed in those sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia and Montenegro -

in the implementation of a structural reform agenda with the\n            main objective of enhancing medium-term fiscal\n            sustainability as a basis for sustained growth and poverty\n            reduction. The reform program to be supported by the\n            operation works to achieve these objectives through\n            implementating specific reforms in the areas of: 1) public\n            expenditure management; 2) the energy sector; and 3) social\n            protection and labor; and 4) the health care sector. The SCA\n            works to solidify the stabilization and reform progress made\n            thus far in FRY and Serbia, and provide a basis for building\n            a more comprehensive program.

The credit will also send an\n            important signal to donors and private investors and\n            creditors, and thereby help stimulate much needed official\n            support and private investments. Given the importance of\n            developments in FRY to the overall prospects for Southeast\n            Europe, this credit for stabilization and recovery in FRY\n            will also have
