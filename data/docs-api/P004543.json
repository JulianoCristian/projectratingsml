The program is composed of three key\n            elements. First, the establishment of a policy framework\n            which enunciates ground rules for the establishment of\n            Government Corporations (GC's). Second, a\n            rationalization program to correct anomalies in the existing\n            public sector corporate portfolio and ensure an appropriate\n            disposition of all GC's; this includes privatization,\n            consolidation, conversion to private non-profit status,\n            transfer to departments or abolition of GCs. Third, an\n            institutional framework for improved operations and\n            monitoring of the corporations remaining in the public\n            sector; this includes clarification of the roles of\n            Government entities dealing with GCs, improvement of their\n            supervision and control, establishing of corporate planning\n            and performance evaluation systems, and improving the\n            accounting and auditing of GCs. Measures to improve the\n            performance of the retained GCs will initially be\n            implemented by 15 of the largest NFGCs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Reform Program For
