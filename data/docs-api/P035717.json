Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            assessed as satisfactory. This project's lessons\n            reinforce those from its predecessor and have influenced\n            design of the Second Rural Poverty Reduction Project - BAHIA\n            (report no. 21337). Main lessons are: Community-Driven\n            Development (CDD) projects, by assigning greater\n            responsibility to local organizations and municipal\n            governments, can successfully support decentralized resource\n            allocation and create social capital in poor rural areas.\n            The equitable graduation of communities who have accumulated\n            sufficient assets and organizational capacity to access\n            mainstream financing and other services, is an important\n            product of the integrated approach. Decentralization of\n            fiscal and investment decisionmaking and implementation to\n            the state and local levels including community\n            organizations, ensures administrative efficiency and\n            superior results. Participation by beneficiaries in the\n            selection, financing, execution, and operation and\n            maintenance of sub-projects ensures that investments meet\n            genuine community needs, leads to cost savings, and\n            increases community \"ownership\" and sustainability\n            of investments. Other lessons concern poverty targeting\n            mechanisms, systematic monitoring and evaluation,\n            dissemination of best practices, standardized subproject\n            documents, technical designs and unit costs, and\n            environmental protection checklists, and more."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rural Poverty Alleviation Project -
