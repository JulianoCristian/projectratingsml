Kemubu Irrigation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This is a project completion report of\n            the Kemubu Irrigation Project in Malaysia. The project works\n            consist of a diesel pumping station on the Kelantan River, a\n            canal system to serve 19,000 ha, drainage and flood control\n            works, and ancillary facilities. Quaternary canals, which\n            serve units of about 20 ha, were originally intended to be\n            constructed by the farmers. When this was found to be\n            impracticable, quaternaries for about 40 percent of the area\n            were added to the Government works. The primary objective of\n            the project was to achieve double cropping of paddy in the\n            area. There was less attention, at appraisal and\n            subsequently, to yields, crops other than paddy, or the\n            appropriate level of on-farm development. Physical\n            construction of the project was completed only slightly\n            behind schedule and the first irrigation water was delivered\n            in late-1971. An extension of the closing date was necessary\n            to complete the quaternary canals. The performance of the\n            consultants (SOGREAH) appears to have been very\n            satisfactory. Except for some poor work early in the main.\n            Canal contract, the performance of contractors appears to\n            have been reasonably' satisfactory. The standard of\n            project operation and maintenance is good but the cost is\n            high (US$52/ha), due to rapidly rising dieseline prices. The\n            Kemubu Pumping Station is unable to deliver its full design\n            discharge and suffers from frequent breakdowns. The system\n            efficiency is low but steps are being taken to improve this\n            through rotational irrigation. The major remaining physical\n            problems are the need for flood mitigation on about 2,000 ha\n            of low-lying lands and the need for further investment in\n            on-farm development, to improve water control so as to\n            reduce operating costs and to permit higher yields and more\n            diversified cropping."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia -
