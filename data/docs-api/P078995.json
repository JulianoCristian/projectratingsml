Ratings for\n            the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Poverty Reduction Credit\n            Project for Burkina Faso are as follows: outcomes of the\n            project were satisfactory, sustainability is moderate, and\n            the performance of the Bank and the Borrower was also rated\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the report are: 1)\n            PRSCs are useful instruments to help the borrower assume\n            increased responsibility in managing its public resources in\n            an efficient manner, notably by providing more flexibility\n            and predictability; however, there is a risk of complacency\n            and of dependence on continued foreign budget support; 2)\n            issues of attribution are inevitable when the reform\n            programs are supported by several donors; 3) since outcomes\n            are to be assessed after several years, the quality of the\n            relevant statistical data is critical; if insufficient,\n            preparation should include remedial actions, including the\n            selection and definition of baseline data; 4) since reforms\n            are of medium-to long-term nature, early identification of\n            institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints is of\n            paramount importance; and 5) to assess outcome of a\n            medium-term program, it is essential that the different\n            documents of a PRSC series be consistent in content and\n            format,

Fifth, and Sixth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC) for Burkina Faso\n            are as follows: overall outcome of the all three PRSC's\n            series was satisfactory, risk to development outcome for all\n            three series was moderate, and the performance of the Bank\n            and the Borrower was also rated satisfactory for all three\n            series. Key lessons drawn from the implementation of PRSC-4\n            to 6 are follows: (i) country ownership. The use of the PRSC\n            instrument to support implementation of the poverty\n            reduction strategy has contributed to strengthen country\n            ownership. Specifically, this PRSC series greatly reinforced\n            the importance of the budget and the country's own\n            capacity for the success of government policies; (ii)\n            harmonization of budget support among donors. The creation\n            of the Cadre General d'Organisation des Appuis\n            Budgetaires (General Framework for Budget Support) (CGAB)\n            and its unified framework for budget support and joint\n            performance matrix provided an effective framework to\n            harmonize the dialogue and efforts of Burkina Faso's\n            development partners, including this PRSC series, with the\n            government's own strategy. In particular, it allowed\n            for early entry points in the policy dialogue with the\n            government and the identification of corrective measures or\n            solution to implementation bottlenecks. It also allowed for\n            all actors to make good use of analytical work. Furthermore,\n            close and continuous dialogue with the government allowed\n            CGAB members to better understand the constraints on the\n            reform process and build government ownership. This was\n            particularly relevant for some complex reform areas, like\n            cotton, decentralization, privatization and the reduction of\n            factor costs; and (iii) primacy of the cotton sector. Recent\n            developments in the cotton sector have highlighted the\n            importance of the sector for the country's\n            macroeconomic stability and growth, the need to adjust the\n            government strategy in the cotton sector to reflect recent\n            exogenous shocks and the importance of continued Bank\n            involvement in this sector. The increased focus of the third\n            PRSC series on reforms in the cotton sector reflects the\n            need to flexibly adjust the strategic orientation and\n            emphasis of the PRSCs. The lessons drawn from the experience\n            with cotton sector reform also show the need to broaden the\n            analysis of the risks inherent in the development of this sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credits"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Fourth, Fifth, and\n

Reduction Support\n            Operation (PRSC-5) Project supports the implementation of\n            the revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for the\n            period 2004-2006. The revised PRSP has four strategic\n            pillars: a) accelerating broad-based growth; b) promoting\n            access to social services; c) increasing employment and\n            income-generating activities for the poor; and, d) promoting\n            good governance. As did the previous operations in the\n            series, PRSC-5 supports the PRSP implementation under three\n            components consistent with these four pillars: 1) growth and\n            employment creation; 2) human resource development; and, 3)\n            good governance. Under the growth and employment creation\n            component, the PRSC-5 supports reforms in the cotton, rural\n            sector, telecommunication sector, energy sector, and the\n            labor market. The objective is to lower factor costs,\n            increase productivity and favor new investments. The second\n            component includes policies in the education, health, social\n            protection, and water sectors to build infrastructure, lower\n            the cost of services, and improve service quality. The third\n            component encompasses policy measures to strengthen budget\n            formulation, execution, procurement, and control, public\n            sector performance, decentralization, and environmental\n            management. The proposed operation is an integral part o f\n            the Bank's strategy presented in the 2000 CAS, and\n            updated in the 2003 CAS progress report. However, risks for\n            the operation arise from the country's weak\n            institutional capacity, still fragile fiduciary progress,\n            natural disasters (drought, locust invasions), commodity\n            prices and currency shocks, and regional instability. The\n            different risks are mitigated under the credit through the\n            approval of two Bank projects to address the institutional\n            capacity issue; the integration in the reform program of key\n            fiduciary reforms; the approval of a project to help prevent\n            and fight locust invasion, and Bank readiness to provide\n            further financial support when needed; a strong track record\n            of the government in adapting to external shocks, through\n            adjustment of non-priority expenditure; an independent\n            monetary policy with a strong record of low inflation; the\n            willingness of the external community to deliver additional\n            credit as needed; and, regional initiatives to solve the\n            political crisis in Cote d'Ivoire."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -
