Some lessons learned\n            included: There was a need for this project and there is\n            still a need for further modernization of existing\n            irrigation and drainage pumping stations and for improved\n            operation and maintenance program. However, ensuring that\n            rehabilitated irrigation and drainage pumping stations are\n            sustainable in the long term should be the first priority in\n            the design of any such project. A repeater project such as\n            this (this was the third project) with a simplified project\n            design should not be at the expense of dealing with broader\n            and longer term issues. All features of water use for\n            agriculture should be considered, rather than only the most\n            urgent repair work to the infrastructure itself, and the\n            need for institution strengthening should be looked at, as\n            well as the possibility of irrigation management transfer\n            and public-private partnership arrangements which are\n            essential for sustainability of irrigation and drainage\n            assets. Some provision should be made in the budget, and\n            flexibility should be introduced in project design so that\n            these issues may be properly addressed during later stages\n            of implementation when the most urgent repair works have\n            been done. The process of establishing a management\n            information system (MIS) and monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) unit should start ahead of project implementation.\n            A baseline survey is needed to appreciate the incremental\n            impact of project-induced changes. The importance of good\n            planning of project implementation cannot be overstressed.\n            For instance, the fact that a certain time is needed for\n            acquisition of land and procurement in accordance with Bank\n            guidelines has been well known for many years, yet still\n            such a factor has been the cause of serious delay."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -
