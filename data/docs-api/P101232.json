Ratings for the Eight-Ninth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project for Uganda were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Inadequate accounting of political economy factors in the\n            design of major reforms can adversely affect the design,\n            implementation and outcomes of DPOs. Lack of focus on\n            domestic revenue mobilization is a prime example. Pressures\n            to extend budget support within the broader, coordinated\n            donor support framework without hard conditionality to raise\n            domestic revenues can undermine incentives for domestic\n            revenue mobilization. This, in turn, can undercut\n            macroeconomic adjustment needed for sustainable fiscal\n            policy as well as the adequacy of funding for basic\n            services. Implementation and evaluation are frequently\n            undermined when objectives are not tightly linked to prior\n            actions and there is no measurable and relevant results\n            framework, when outcome indicators are ambiguous, and when\n            targets do not incorporate an explicit and convincing theory\n            of change. Achievement and sustainability of development\n            outcomes are facilitated by careful attention to political\n            economy dimensions, both at the design stage and when making\n            changes in a DPO series. For example, the failure to\n            increase revenue mobilization over a long period of time,\n            which was not addressed under the program, was directly\n            related to the political economy of political patronage and\n            large, entrenched tax exemptions and culture of\n            non-compliance. DPOs can show improvements in design and\n            outcomes when they actively use lessons from the past\n            operations as well as integrate important technical\n            knowledge products (such as CEMs and PERs). Such lessons can\n            also inform the Bank to take proactive, if difficult\n            measures such as the cancellation of an operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Fifth-Ninth Poverty

Intensive coordination\n            efforts with development partners paid off in terms of a\n            results framework that could be used for program tracking\n            and management.

          Credit Program (PRSC 8) is the first in a series of\n            operations prepared in a Joint Budget Support Framework\n            (JBSF) with development partners. It is the first of three\n            development policy lending (DPL) operations to support\n            Uganda's poverty reduction strategy. The operations\n            cover the period 2010-13. The government's previous\n            poverty reduction strategies reduced the share of households\n            living in poverty from 44 percent in 1997, to 38 percent in\n            2001/02, and to 31 percent in 2005/06. The operation takes\n            into account the impact of the global slump on the Ugandan\n            economy, which became more evident in 2009/10. In 2008/09,\n            the global economic slowdown resulted in an underperformance\n            in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 1.5 percentage\n            points and a shortfall in fiscal revenues equivalent to 0.5\n            percent of GDP. This was underpinned by slowdown in exports\n            and lower foreign direct investment, which constrained\n            private investment and threatened to reduce the pace of\n            poverty reduction. Preliminary estimates suggest the impact\n            was worse than anticipated in 2009/10 as domestic demand is\n            feared to have slumped. The fiscal stimuli envisaged through\n            government's earlier strategy for public investment\n            through infrastructure spending in the 2008/09 and 2009/10\n            has been constrained by implementation and absorption\n            capacity issues. To ensure that the economy remains robust\n            and to be able to address any vulnerability to growth and\n            poverty reduction, fiscal policy will have to remain\n            accommodative. To this end, supplementary resources provided\n            under the Crisis Response Window will help the government\n            maintain investment and counteract the global crisis, while\n            the PRSC support for efficiency gains in public spending can\n            in turn help to address implementation and absorptive\n            capacity issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Eighth
