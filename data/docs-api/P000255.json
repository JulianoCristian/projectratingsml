Technical assistance\n            will also be provided for training OPEV and CNPAR personnel\n            as well as for imparting technical and managerial skills to\n            entrepreneurs. The beneficiaries are the artisans,\n            entrepreneurs and their employees who would be the\n            recipients of funds provided through the project and\n            technical assistance.
