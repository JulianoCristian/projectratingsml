Some lessons learned included:\n            grants and guarantees are not sufficient to develop an\n            energy efficiency market, whereas capacity building\n            (awareness, coordination, and training) is critical. The\n            Tunisian experience showed that incentives were not\n            immediately effective because there were serious obstacles\n            to overcome: awareness about energy efficiency, low\n            technical capacity, and lack of trust among key\n            stakeholders. The role of a pro-active Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) as a driver for market development\n            was important at an early stage. This project provided two\n            financial intermediation instruments, a subsidy and a\n            guarantee, instead of one as in other similar operations. It\n            allowed different stakeholders access to different support\n            mechanisms, which led to a very complex administration\n            model. The governance structure and eligibility criteria of\n            both instruments were complex, which created more\n            difficulties to the implementing agency managing the\n            project. A simple structure should be sought in future\n            projects to enhance development impacts. Commercial banks in\n            Tunisia kept requesting large collaterals for ESCOs (Energy\n            Service Company) credits despite the project's\n            guarantee fund. While commercial banks were used to provide\n            credit to regular industrial clients with adequate assets,\n            ESCOs with small balance-sheets and\n            'unconventional' energy efficiency projects were\n            barred from credit. The cash-flow from energy savings is not\n            a familiar form of revenue or collateral to back lending.\n            The familiarization process by the banking sector on the\n            evaluation of energy efficiency projects must not be\n            underestimated. The project was well anchored in the\n            government policy and the institutional structures. The\n            decision to host the PIU at ANME (Agence Nationale pour la\n            Maitrise de l'Energie - National Energy Management\n            Agency) was highly positive. The ANME managed the newly\n            created FNME, which provided the main incentive (20 percent\n            subsidy) for energy efficiency projects. Hence, the 10\n            percent subsidy provided by the PEEI (Programme Efficacite\n            Energetique dans le secteur Industriel - Energy Efficiency\n            Program in the Industrial Sector) project complemented it.\n            The administrative coordination between the PIU and ANME to\n            approve and disburse the subsidies was therefore easier."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Energy Efficiency Program\n            Industrial Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Energy Efficiency\n            Program Industrial
