Some lessons\n            learned included: innovations should be piloted in more than\n            one area. Although this adds a layer of complexity, it will\n            test the innovation in a variety of circumstances.\n            Attempting to fine-tune the criteria and select a pilot that\n            appears to have the best conditions risks failure of the\n            test, as unforeseen circumstances may arise that cannot be\n            resolved. The importance of communications in establishing\n            the transparency and trust needed for effective\n            participation of a range of diverse stakeholders has already\n            been mentioned. Communications must be tailored to address\n            local interests and concerns. A communications strategy\n            should be conceived of broadly, going beyond dissemination\n            of information to promoting forums, processes, mechanisms,\n            and instruments for inclusion. The willingness of local\n            populations and communities to become involved in\n            conservation tasks is enormous. Participatory management\n            will progress and succeed to the extent that there is shared\n            information and analysis and the parties perceive the\n            distribution of costs and benefits as equitable. Economic\n            interests may be more powerful than environmental awareness\n            as a motivation for participation. Thus environmental\n            awareness raising programs will not be enough to achieve\n            effective participation. A long-term results-oriented\n            management approach, such as the Administration Contract\n            instrument, may more effectively promote efficiency than the\n            more traditional project-specific implementation contract.\n            The requirement for the contractor to make a financial\n            commitment also promotes efficiency. It is important,\n            however, to allow the financial commitment to be fulfilled\n            progressively in order not to discriminate against smaller\n            partners that may have less short-term financial capacity.\n            It should not be assumed that the Borrower agencies that\n            participated in project preparation and are to be involved\n            in its implementation will have a clear, much less common,\n            view of the objectives, strategy, and activities of the\n            project, particularly as the preparation phase may be\n            lengthy and there may be rotation of key staff during it.\n            Project launch to promote a common understanding and buy-in\n            is, therefore, critical."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -

objectives are: i) insure biodiversity conservation by\n            increasing the involvement of civil society institutions and\n            the private sector in planning and sustainable management of\n            at least five protected areas (PA) of the Peruvian System of\n            Natural Protected Areas (SINANPE), and one PA to be created\n            during project implementation; and ii) obtain sustainability\n            for the financing of recurrent cost in SINANPE. The project\n            will build upon the experience gained during the first GEF\n            Grant to PROFONANPE, supporting the Trus Fund's\n            establishment and development of its capacity to attract\n            financial resources for conservation.

in the decision making process and\n            management of the PAs; 2) institutional development to\n            consolidate PA management through the strengthening of\n            INRENA, PROFONANPE, PAMCs, civil society organizations and\n            private sector to manage the PAs collaboratively; 3) PA\n            financing, administration, monitoring and evaluation, and\n

during preparation. First, certain\n            zoning categories defined in the Management Plans may result\n            in limiting or eliminating public access to relevant areas\n            (strict conservation areas). Second, five of the six\n            protected areas are populated by ethnic or indigenous\n            groups, most of which live in extreme poverty and depend on\n            subsistence agriculture and natural resources exploitation.\n            Demographic growth and consumption patterns have combined\n            and increased pressure on PA lands and natural resources.\n            Land tenure disputes exist in three of the five areas and\n            will not be resolved by this project. The project promoted\n            private involvement in PA management through concessions,\n            which has been perceived by some communities as adversely\n            affecting their welfare. Lastly there is a risk that the\n            privatization approach may further complicate the\n            relationship existing between the National Institute for\n            Natural Resources (INRENA) and the communities and result in\n            impeding PA management. To address these issues, the\n            project's social strategy calls for adopting a Process\n            Framework and an Indigenous Peoples Development Framework,\n            and promoting public participation in project-supported PAs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -
