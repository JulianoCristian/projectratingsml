The project achieved\n            some of its objectives, institutional development was\n            negligible, sustainability is uncertain, and the performance\n            of the Bank was marginally satisfactory while the\n            Borrower's was unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, it is better to\n            restructure a project instead of developing a new one with\n            similar objectives. Second, when the Borrower's\n            procurement capacity is deficient, the use of an outside\n            procurement agent should be considered at an early stage.\n            Third, future operations should focus on ensuring clear and\n            effective implementation and management arrangements,\n            particularly in financial accountability. Fourth, unless a\n            better implementation arrangement for construction can be\n            established, civil works should be kept to a minimum in\n            future operations, focusing primarily on rehabilitation or\n            upgrading. Fifth, the need for adequate supervision,\n            including field visits by both the Bank and Borrower, cannot\n            be overemphasized. Sixth, in future operations where NGOs\n            will be used, GOK needs to improve NGO coordination and NGOs\n            need to strengthen their financial accountability. Finally,\n            training programs should be better prioritized and staff\n            sent only on training in areas of identified needs and where\n            there is a clear prospect that the training will help the\n            project or sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -
