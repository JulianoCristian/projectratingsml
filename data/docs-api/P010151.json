It assesses\n            the outcome, impact, and sustainability of the major\n            productive components of the two projects. From a\n            quantitative and qualitative viewpoint, it found the\n            projects' performance to be mixed. The ERRs (Economic\n            Rate for Return) for the productive components were\n            generally below the traditional cutoff point for a\n            satisfactory rating. In addition, the quality of the initial\n            rehabilitation works was poor and the subsequent O&M\n            (Operation and Maintenance) insufficient. The primary\n            problems behind the poor performance were: 1) overly\n            optimistic SAR targets; 2) over-attribution of production\n            increases to project actions; and 3) lack of beneficiary\n            involvement, poor supervision, and an absence of\n            transitional planning. Despite these shortcomings, some\n            success did emerge. First, paddy yields in the small\n            irrigation schemes rehabilitated under the projects proved\n            to be above average for the districts and had increased more\n            rapidly than in the country as a whole. Second, the\n            infrastructure projects provided significant benefits.\n            Lastly, the line agencies involved in implementing the\n            projects expanded their implementation capacity\n            considerably. Overall, the impact of the projects can be\n            considered marginally satisfactory."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Kurunegala and Second Rural\n            Development Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Kurunegala and Second\n            Rural Development Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/03/441894/sri-lanka-kurunegala-second-rural-development-projects","projn":"LK-Second Rural Devt. -- P010151,LK-Kurunegala Rural Dev -- P010129","docty":"Impact Evaluation Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Health Economics & Finance,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970818102956"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-1","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to markets,ADB,agricultural\n            development,agricultural extension,agricultural extension\n            services,Agricultural Production,Agriculture,Asian\n            Development Bank,audit reports,beneficiaries,Coconut,Crop\n            Production,Cropping,Crops,Development Projects,Economic\n            Analysis,education,employment\n            opportunities,equipment,FAO,Farmers,Farming,fisheries,flexibility,forestry,government\n            investments,health,households,IIMI,Income,incomes,Infant\n            Mortality,Integration,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Systems,Lands,living standards,Operations,Project\n            Completion,rice,rural areas,Rural Development,rural\n            infrastructure,rural population,rural roads,satisfactory\n            ratings,stakeholders,Structural\n            Adjustment,Supervision,sustainability,transport,United\n            Nations,Water Resources,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to markets,ADB,agricultural\n            development,agricultural extension,agricultural extension\n            services,Agricultural Production,Agriculture,Asian\n            Development Bank,audit reports,beneficiaries,Coconut,Crop\n            Production,Cropping,Crops,Development Projects,Economic\n            Analysis,education,employment\n            opportunities,equipment,FAO,Farmers,Farming,fisheries,flexibility,forestry,government\n            investments,health,households,IIMI,Income,incomes,Infant\n            Mortality,Integration,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Systems,Lands,living standards,Operations,Project\n            Completion,rice,rural areas,Rural Development,rural\n            infrastructure,rural population,rural roads,satisfactory\n            ratings,stakeholders,Structural\n            Adjustment,Supervision,sustainability,transport,United\n            Nations,Water Resources,water supply"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"16418"},"735872":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/09/735872/sri-lanka-second-rural-development-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1991/09/735872/sri-lanka-second-rural-development-project","new_url":"1991/09/735872/sri-lanka-second-rural-development-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/09/19/000009265_3960925051417/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1991/09/19/000009265_3960925051417/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"1079","datestored":"2003-04-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1991-09-19T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Second Rural Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the Second Rural\n            Development Project for Sri Lanka was successful. The main\n            objective, to improve the productivity, income, and living\n            standards of people in the Puttalam and Matale districts,\n            was achieved. Implementation of the project was deemed\n            satisfactory even though there were delays. The project is\n            sustainable for the future. Both the Borrower and the Bank\n            acted effectively. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            experience. First, the project confirms that the approach\n            taken to achieve a broad-based development of Sri\n            Lanka's districts, initiated under the Kurunegala Rural\n            Development Project, is appropriate and replicable under the\n            country's conditions. Second, project design should\n            have focused more clearly on organization and management\n            aspects to ensure effective coordination among the multiple\n            line agencies. Third, the project would have been easier to\n            supervise if it did not include such a wide and diverse\n            range of subprojects. Lastly, the project period should have\n            been longer than envisaged due to implementation delays that\n            arose when a large number of agencies were involved and\n            funds were in short supply."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Second Rural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Second Rural\n            Development

raising productivity, employment, incomes and\n            living standards. The project will: (i) improve the\n            provision of inputs and services required for the directly\n            productive sectors; (ii) increase plantings of coconut and\n            minor export crops; (iii) rehabilitate and improve economic\n            infrastructure; and (iv) improve social infrastructure. The\n            project will benefit about 130,000 farm families, about\n            two-thirds of these families being in the poverty target\n            groups. The project design closely follows the model\n            developed for the Kurunegala Rural Development Project\n            (Credit No. 891). The project suffers from inherent risks\n            associated with such a multi-component project and faces\n            difficulties associated with actions in politically\n            sensitive and institutionally demanding areas. However, such\n            risks are reduced by the successful experience with\n            decentralized system in the above-mentioned Kurunegala project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Second
