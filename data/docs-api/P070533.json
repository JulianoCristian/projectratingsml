The\n            Agricultural Rehabilitation Project had the following\n            ratings: moderately satisfactory outcome, unlikely\n            sustainability, modest institutional development impact,\n            satisfactory Bank performance, and not rated Grantee\n            performance.  The Second Agricultural Rehabilitation Project\n            had the following ratings: moderately unsatisfactory\n            outcome, unlikely sustainability, modest institutional\n            development impact, unsatisfactory Bank performance, and\n            satisfactory Grantee performance. Experience with these\n            projects highlights the following lessons: 1) With its\n            global outreach and the expertise and experience of its\n            staff the Bank is well positioned to make a substantial\n            contribution to post-conflict reconstruction and\n            development.  However, the experience of the three community\n            empowerment and the two agriculture rehabilitation projects\n            shows that careful thought to suitability of design and\n            strategies to country conditions is paramount, especially\n            where country capacity is weak; 2) even in the case of\n            post-conflict Timor-Leste, where sophisticated monitoring\n            and evaluation was impractical, there was a need to have a\n            system to track project inputs, outputs, and outcomes and\n            provide information about the adaptations needed in project\n            design to ensure that the project objectives and activities\n            are in keeping with the emerging institutional context and\n            the absorptive capacity of the country; 3) particularly in\n            post-conflict environments, an approach to capacity building\n            that considers the underlying capacity in the country as\n            well as how it would be promoted by the various donors is\n            critical; and 4) the experience of Timor-Leste highlights\n            the critical importance of coordinating multi-agency\n            reconstruction efforts more effectively in a newly\n            independent post-conflict country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste -

Through the first agriculture rehabilitation\n            project, the World Bank-administered trust fund for east\n            Timor has helped communities get farm animals and farm\n            tools, repaired small irrigation schemes and roads, and\n            trained agriculture staff. A second phase of this\n            initiative, approved in June 2001, aims to build on the\n            successful community-based activities of the first project\n            by improving food security for farm families and increasing\n            agricultural production. More than a thousand radios have\n            been given away to people living in 14 separate communities\n            to ensure they can stay in touch with the issues facing\n            their new nation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Stimuler la confiance en soi au Timor Oriental"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Boosting self-reliance in East\n            Timor : Stimuler la confiance en soi au Timor Oriental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23835384/boosting-self-reliance-east-timor-stimuler-la-confiance-en-soi-au-timor-oriental","count":"Timor-Leste","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Information and communications,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production, Agriculture,\n            buffalo, candle, cattle, chickens, coffee, coffee\n            production, farm, farm animals, farmers, farms, food\n            security, issues, livestock, marketing, nut, pigs, rice,\n            roads, seed, seed stocks"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Stimuler la confiance en soi au Timor Oriental"}},"topic":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Crop Production m1326627 174,Crop Selection and Production m1326441 1968,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170,Agricultural Research m1326207 197","projn":"TP-Agriculture Rehabilitation Project -- P070533","subtopic":"Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Food & Beverage Industry,Wildlife Resources,Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Crops and Crop Management Systems","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Rural Development,Environment,Agriculture,Industry","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150120135746"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,General information and communications sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","theme":"Conflict prevention and post-conflict reconstruction,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural non-farm income generation,Other rural development,Nutrition and food security","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Environment,Agriculture,Industry","prdln":"Special Financing","topicv3":"Agricultural Finance m1326892 1059,Crop Production m1326627 174,Crop Selection and Production m1326441 1968,Agricultural Policies m1326884 170,Agricultural Research m1326207 197","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF023762-TFET - IBRD OPERATING COSTS\n            ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRUST FUND FOR EAST TIM,TF023824-TFET - AGRICULTURE\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF038992-EAST TIMOR - AGRICULTURE\n            REHABILITATION PROJECTS I & II SPN,TF040620-EAST TIMOR - AGRIC.
