The key lessons learned\n            include: 1) In project design, it is essential to get full\n            commitment of the borrower at the time of appraisal and\n            Board presentation to key aims. 2) In contrast to macro or\n            sector adjustment programs where reforms deal with general\n            policies, in the case of a project involving complex\n            institutional restructuring, objectives need to be simple,\n            tried, and selective. 3) Loan appraisal and early\n            implementation should include an in-depth review of market\n            conditions, particularly when the project involves the\n            restructuring of an organization and promotion of new\n            services. 4) Divestiture of equity holdings comprised of\n            privately held shares is a long drawn out process,\n            especially in those cases where they represent a controlling\n            interest in a non-viable corporation which needs major\n            restructuring.
