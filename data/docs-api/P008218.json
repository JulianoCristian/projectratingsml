Nonetheless, several lessons drawn from the\n            project suggest the following. It is once again reinforced\n            that project design, particularly if directed at improving\n            education quality, should be simple, with limited, and few\n            components and implementing agencies, to allow enough\n            flexibility to adapt to the changing requirements of a\n            dynamic education system. Furthermore, design should also\n            provide for effective implementation capacity on the part of\n            the borrower, since weak capacity, or untrained project\n            units, may lead to operational standstill as a result of\n            project complexity. The introduction of educational\n            innovation could fail, unless a clear understanding is\n            developed between teachers, and political leaders, on the\n            value of supplementary educational financing - based upon\n            autonomous assessment of local weaknesses, and needs - and,\n            provided that technical capacity, developed toward project\n            objectives, remains within the system. In addition, quality\n            improvement projects, with direct interventions in the\n            operation of an educational system, should define, and\n            engage institutional roles among all agencies, and the\n            Ministry staff having operational responsibilities,\n            regardless of whether design and preparation are\n            commissioned to outside

Because education is moving toward being\n            decentralized, another important objective of the project is\n            to help states develop their own capacity for managing the\n            system efficiently.  Toward these ends the project will:\n            (a) increase student access to textbooks and other\n            instructional materials; (b) improve teachers' skills\n            and effectiveness in teaching; (c) improve the education\n            management capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and\n            of the State Education Secretariats (SES); and (d) develop\n            MOE's capacity to coordinate and formulate policies,\n            monitor student learning and school quality, and identify\n            bottlenecks and problems at the state and local levels in a\n            timely manner.
