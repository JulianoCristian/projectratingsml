farmers' families in the eastern part of\n            the Ingavi Province and the southern part of the Los Andes\n            Province through higher income and improved health\n            conditions. The main thrust of the project will be to\n            increase production of 4,000 project farmers and to provide\n            complementary infrastructure (85 km of roads; 20 irrigation\n            wells) and social services (six health posts; potable water\n            supply) for all of the 10,000 rural families presently\n            living in the project area. With the use of improved seed,\n            additional fertilizer, supplementary irrigation, and\n            improved breeding stock, yields can be more than doubled and\n            incomes increased accordingly. These increases can be\n            achieved, however, only through a well coordinated package\n            of activities involving credit for investments and working\n            capital, technical assistance, supporting infrastructure,\n            and some improvement of social facilities which will\n            directly help to improve the quality of life of the
