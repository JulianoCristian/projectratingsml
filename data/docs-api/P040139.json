The most\n            important results included: a) new investments to\n            enterprises, predominantly, Small and Medium Enterprises\n            (SMEs); b) strengthening institutional capacity of\n            Participating Commercial Banks (PCBs); c) increased\n            competition in the financial sector; and d) establishment of\n            sustained market for long and medium-term project finance.\n            The project also had a positive impact on institutional\n            building in Croatia. The implementation of the Institutional\n            Development Plans (IDPs) was also successful, with most of\n            the objectives achieved and activities completed though with\n            some delays. During the Summer 2000, when the macro and\n            financial situation was difficult and affected a number of\n            banks, the Alpe Jadran Banka loan was suspended. AJB, in\n            addition to systematic problems affecting the banking and\n            enterprise sector, experienced corporate problems triggered\n            by the split between to major owners followed by changes in\n            the corporate structure of the bank. In Fall 2000, the\n            project returned to a satisfactory rating, after\n            cancellation of the AJB loan, and with the Dalmatinska Bank\n            overcoming its difficulties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Investment Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Investment Recovery
