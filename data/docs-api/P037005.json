The project was mostly devoted to supporting\n            capitalization and its related legal reforms, which were\n            highly satisfactory. The government's commitment, both\n            in the political, and technical fields, allowed for a rapid,\n            though demanding, reform program. The key lessons learned\n            suggest privatization should better be preceded by the\n            establishment of a legal and regulatory framework, designed\n            to promote competition, and efficiency. Obviously,\n            Governments tend to focus - primarily - on transactions,\n            upon the divestiture of large state-owned enterprises, to\n            the detriment of the accompanying legal and regulatory\n            reforms. However, the Bank can emphasize these latter\n            aspects through advice, and, guidance on best practices, as\n            well as through the initial financing of regulatory\n            agencies. The provision of technical assistance (TA) in a\n            stand-alone operation, i.e., separate from an adjustment\n            operation, allows maximum flexibility. As in this case, TA\n            allowed for better support to preparatory efforts, as well\n            as for the demonstrated commitment to satisfy an up-front\n            conditionality on adjustment operations. TA projects are not\n            designed to handle procurement procedures involving prior\n            review; however, combining prior review thresholds with\n            ex-post review mechanisms, could prove effective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Regulatory Reform and\n            Capitalization Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Regulatory Reform and\n            Capitalization Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728364/bolivia-regulatory-reform-capitalization-technical-assistance-project","projn":"BO-Regulatory Ref & Cap -- P037005","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Housing Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99072708212780"},"subsc":"Law and justice,Telecommunications,Aviation,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,asset\n            valuation,auditors,autonomy,benchmarks,bidding,book\n            value,Capitalization,consumer\n            protection,consumers,decision-making,disbursement,economists,electricity\n            generation,EXCHANGE RATE,expenditures,Financial\n            Markets,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,information systems,institutional\n            development,investment banks,laws,media,monitoring\n            equipment,political parties,potential investors,price\n            discrimination,Privatization,productivity,profitability,programs,public\n            enterprises,public hearings,radio,regulatory\n            agencies,regulatory framework,Regulatory Reform,regulatory\n            tasks,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            Company,telecommunications regulator,telephone\n            penetration,television,training programs,transport"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,asset\n            valuation,auditors,autonomy,benchmarks,bidding,book\n            value,Capitalization,consumer\n            protection,consumers,decision-making,disbursement,economists,electricity\n            generation,EXCHANGE RATE,expenditures,Financial\n            Markets,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,information systems,institutional\n            development,investment banks,laws,media,monitoring\n            equipment,political parties,potential investors,price\n            discrimination,Privatization,productivity,profitability,programs,public\n            enterprises,public hearings,radio,regulatory\n            agencies,regulatory framework,Regulatory Reform,regulatory\n            tasks,Technical\n            Assistance,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            Company,telecommunications regulator,telephone\n            penetration,television,training programs,transport"}},"owner":"Fin, Private Sec & Infrastructur (LCSFP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF021403-PHRD-CAPITALIZATION PROGRAM\n            ADJ.
