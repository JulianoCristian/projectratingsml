Overall World Bank\n            and Borrower performances were satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included the following: Poverty-focused social service\n            delivery projects should be increasingly targeted at the\n            township rather than the county level. As provinces and\n            counties which have benefited from IDA and IBRD financing\n            have to repay the credits and loans, and most likely from\n            provincial and county education budgets, caution must be\n            taken in the design of future poverty-focused education\n            projects to fully consider not only the assumed counterpart\n            obligations, but also the future repayment responsibilities\n            when calculating project sustainability. The key issue in\n            developing education projects at the provincial, county, and\n            township levels is to convince the Chinese preparation teams\n            that focusing on development outcomes is more important than\n            emphasis on investment inputs. Project preparation teams\n            must be diligent in working with the Borrower to obtain\n            agreement on educational outcome indicators during the\n            earliest stages of project design. Establishing experts\n            panel with a broad range of educational skills from the\n            start of the targeting exercise ensures the project of some\n            balance in educational, financial, and staffing needs.\n            Teacher and staff training components have been chronically\n            weak in Bank-supported basic education projects.

The quality\n            enhancement component will promote innovations and other\n            improvements in primary and lower secondary schools by\n            supporting a program of self-generated action-oriented\n            research activities and the development of minority and\n            bilingual book and textbook preparation, production,\n            publication and
