The\n            lessons learned indicate that exclusion of key stakeholders\n            in preparation and implementation significantly reduce\n            benefits. Follow-up on key indicators needs to be sustained\n            throughout the entire duration of the project and\n            requirements regarding periodic reporting by the borrower\n            should be enforced. Careful coordination with other donors\n            is important to maximize benefits. Uncoordinated activities\n            can easily result in duplication of efforts or diversion of\n            efforts into lower-priority areas. The Legal Development\n            Project confirmed the general lesson from reform projects:\n            reform, including judicial reform, is a long-term process,\n            highly dependent on political will. To have the maximum\n            impact, technical reform initiatives should ideally be\n            planned to complement political progress on creation of the\n            legal and political foundation for reform initiatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza -

The\n            project's five components are to: (1) unify and develop\n            the existing legal framework by financing studies and the\n            services of outside experts to help draft legal texts and\n            give substantive advice; (2) improve the judiciary's\n            administrative and case management procedures, and reduce\n            the case backlog; (3) introduce selected training programs\n            for judges, develop a judicial education structure,\n            curriculum, and standards, establish a resource center,\n            train judicial educators, develop a long-range training\n            plan, establish internal and external programs, developing\n            teaching materials, and a code of ethics; (4) expand the use\n            of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms within the\n            judiciary; and (5) disseminate legislation and court\n            precedents to the legal, judicial, academic, and business\n            communities, and the public at large by enhancing law\n            libraries to serve as reference centers, support the\n            publication and dissemination of court decisions and laws,\n            and of bench manuals, support a legal information connection\n            to assist the Ministry of Justice in legal research, and\n            establish a legal database to support law dissemination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza -
