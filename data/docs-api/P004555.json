Some lessons learned included: there is\n            a need to incorporate a degree of flexibility in geothermal\n            and other natural resource projects since exploration during\n            implementation can lead to changes in project design (e.g.,\n            location and number of wells). An integrated approach should\n            be followed in projects where the fuel supply infrastructure\n            would need to be constructed in concert with the generation\n            plant. This is important since such infrastructure would\n            vary depending on the type of fuel utilized, such as steam\n            or gas. Moreover, this approach should encompass project\n            design and institutional design in implementation. The Bank\n            should obtain sufficient assurances to ensure the\n            availability and timeliness of co-financing funds prior to\n            implementation. Financial weakness on the part of a borrower\n            already poses a significant risk when undertaking expensive\n            infrastructure investments. The possibility of slippages in\n            co-financing adds further to that risk. Although a\n            significant proportion of co-financing agreements are\n            through bilateral arrangements, the Bank should exert its\n            influence as a major contributor to the project. Despite the\n            satisfactory position of National Power Corporation's\n            (NPC's) finances at present, the Bank should continue\n            monitoring the situation closely. Particularly given the\n            rapid pace of reform in the power sector, it is critical\n            that NPC maintain adequate cash generation to sufficiently\n            finance the timely implementation of its investment program.\n            To do so, NPC must ensure that tariff levels are broadly in\n            line with long-run marginal costs (LRMC)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Bacon Manito Geothermal Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Bacon Manito\n            Geothermal Power
