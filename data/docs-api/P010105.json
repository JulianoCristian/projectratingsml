Although the Bank financed only 10 percent\n            of the railways fifth five-year plan, it contributed to\n            reducing the scope of the investments to a more realistic\n            level in regard to the limited resources of the country,\n            immediate needs of the railways; and the prevention of\n            further deterioration of the railways carrying capacity. The\n            project objectives were appropriate and the technical\n            approaches generally satisfactory. The lessons learned from\n            the project have been taken Into account during preparation\n            of the Eleventh Railway Project, and are the following, (a)\n            since PR's ability to cope with traffic demand depends\n            on various factors (such as institutional improvements) the\n            Bank has adopted a more conservative approach in freight\n            traffic forecasting and any cost reductions expected from an\n            improvement in management has not been taken into account in\n            financial forecasts, (b) since motive power maintenance was\n            the main stumbling block in achieving most of the operating\n            efficiencies, this matter has been given top priority in the\n            project, (c) the Bank financed study on the future role of\n            the railway has given the Government of Pakistan and PR a\n            clearer view of the railways deficiencies, its capabilities,\n            its economic importance within the transport sector and the\n            objectives to be sec in transport planning to allow the\n            railway to maintain and improve its role."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
