They received less than a third of total\n            runoff. This made these areas extremely vulnerable to major\n            surface and groundwater shortages, with profound\n            implications for further economic development. In the early\n            1990s, the Government of Mexico determined that a major\n            effort needed to be made to improve water management,\n            conservation, and intersectoral allocation of water\n            resources. A new national water law was approved in 1992 and\n            its regulations were passed in 1994. The law sets out broad\n            mandates for the development and implementation of plans and\n            policies related to water resources management and assigns\n            the national water commission, created in 1989, the\n            responsibility to carry them out. The national water plan\n            1995-2000 aimed at ensuring adequate water to satisfy the\n            needs of the population and promote environmentally\n            sustainable economic development. In line with the national\n            water plan, the national water commission set a new agenda\n            to modernize and decentralize the nation's water\n            resources by considering all uses and the preservation of\n            the environment. The Water Resources Management Project was\n            prepared to support these efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Creating an integrated water resource\n            management system : Mexico's Water Resources Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Creating an integrated water\n            resource management system : Mexico's Water Resources\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/10/9984456/creating-integrated-water-resource-management-system-mexicos-water-resources-management-project","projn":"1W-Feature Stories -- P111132,MX-Water Resources Management Project -- P007713","subtopic":"Water Use,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Mexico,World","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20081031000903"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean,The World Region,The World Region","colti":"Water feature stories ; issue no. 26","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Knowledge Management Product","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate water, allocation of water, aquifer\n            management, basins, comprehensive water resources\n            management, drawdown, groundwater, groundwater quality,\n            hydraulic infrastructure, hydrometric stations, management\n            of water, managing water resources, National Water, National\n            Water Law, National Water Plan, poor water quality,\n            population growth, river basin, sustainable water, use of\n            water, water fees, Water Law, water management, water\n            markets, water quantity, Water Resource, Water Resource\n            Management, Water Resources, Water Resources Management,\n            water rights, water rights administration, Water Sector,\n            water users"}},"owner":"Urban Development Sector Unit (EASUR),Environment (LCSEN),Water Unit (TWIWA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF025263-PHRD-WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF025265-PHRD-SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,TF034244-MEXICO - WATER RESOURCES\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT","repnb":"46239"},"6505036":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/12/6505036/mexico-water-resources-management-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/12/6505036/mexico-water-resources-management-project","new_url":"2005/12/6505036/mexico-water-resources-management-project","disclosure_date":"2006-01-25T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/12/29/000160016_20051229150458/Rendered/INDEX/34697.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/12/29/000160016_20051229150458/Rendered/PDF/34697.pdf","loan_no":"4050","datestored":"2005-12-29T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2005-12-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Water Resources Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is substantial; and both\n            Bank and Borrower performances are satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons cited were the following: 1) Sustainable water\n            resources management efforts cannot succeed without a\n            holistic integrated approach that deals with irrigation and\n            drainage, water supply and sanitation, agricultural\n            productivity and the environment; these need to be planned\n            and managed at the basin or aquifer level with the direct\n            participation of water users and other stakeholders. 2)\n            Although integrated water resource management projects are\n            inherently complex, care should be taken to limit the scope\n            to the extent possible and to focus on the most important\n            elements. The dam safety and some of the meteorological\n            services sub-components could perhaps have been handled\n            better under separate operations. 3) Climatological and\n            hydrological monitoring networks need to be well designed\n            and have strong operation and maintenance programs. 4)\n            Because of the inability to measure the amount of water\n            usage by each water user, Mexico opted to assign water\n            rights amounts based on declarations by the water users when\n            they registered. This resulted in over-allocations, and this\n            aspect has complicated the effectiveness of the water rights\n            program. 5) The gradual incorporation of the users into the\n            decision-making processes at the River Basin Councils and\n            Aquifer Committees is contributing to addressing the\n            sustainability of the resource. 6) Although the process of\n            decentralization has gained some momentum, it is imperative\n            that additional activities, such as improving regulations\n            and procedures in support of the national water law, and\n            continuing to build capacities are followed up. 7) It is\n            important that the Government provides a clear signal and\n            remains true to the reform process in support of the\n            national water law, to create confidence and political\n            support for integrated water resources management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
