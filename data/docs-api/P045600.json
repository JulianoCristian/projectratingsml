The main objective was\n            achieved. Sixteen states ended up meeting entry conditions\n            and became participants in the project, compared to fifteen\n            potential candidate states identified at appraisal.\n            Activities related to institutional development were carried\n            out, but they were intended to help prepare institutional\n            development changes rather than carry out reforms. A key\n            indicator of the project's sustainability is the\n            satisfactory progress, with just minor exceptions, in the\n            implementation of the several follow-on state road projects\n            that were originated by the technical assistance (TA)\n            project. The following lessons were learned: The risks of\n            multi-state projects should be carefully assessed during\n            preparation, especially due to the greater complexity of\n            supervision required.

The positive lessons learned convey\n            that technical assistance (TA) is most effective in\n            supporting policy, and institutional reforms, provided these\n            reforms are linked to future investment support, i.e.,\n            incentives such as access to external investment, to prod\n            positive responsiveness by State road agencies, including\n            the serious application of environmental and social laws,\n            and regulations, procurement, and financial management. As\n            well, having the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) a\n            non-sector specific body as the central implementing agency,\n            was successful in delivering a TA project to time, quality,\n            and cost constraints. Moreover, the adoption by\n            participating states of a standardized project\n            identification and preparation framework, allowed the\n            efficient delivery of multiple project preparation, both for\n            the states, the DEA, and the Bank itself. Other lessons to\n            be addressed in the future suggest the development of\n            performance indicators to measure project results on\n            institutional impacts, including more formal mechanisms to\n            involve non-government stakeholders in the preparation of\n            institutional, and policy reform elements. Likewise,\n            requirements for investment projects preparation in meeting\n            environmental, and social safeguards, need to be applied on\n            a consistent basis, to minimize clients' uncertainty,\n            while, the states' experience with the standard terms\n            of reference (TORs) for project coordinating consultancy\n            services, proved mixed; rather the secondment of road agency\n            staff to the project coordinating consultants, or explicit\n            TORs that specify the required staff skills'\n            development outcomes, should be practiced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
