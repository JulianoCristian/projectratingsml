the quality of life in\n            agrarian reform communities in Philippines. In 2002, about\n            37 percent of the rural population in the Philippines lived\n            below the poverty line. An integral part of the\n            government's strategy for reducing poverty and inequity\n            in land ownership, particularly in rural areas, had been the\n            land reform program implemented through the Comprehensive\n            Agrarian Reform Program. The project funded by World Bank\n            implemented community development and capacity-building\n            activities to ensure active community participation and\n            self-reliance among agrarian reform beneficiaries and\n            organizations. Using a community-driven approach, rural\n            infrastructure was provided based on the prioritized needs\n            of the communities. It included rural roads, bridges,\n            small-scale irrigation, potable water supply systems and\n            post-harvest facilities. Through the assistance of the World\n            Bank, the Philippines boosted agricultural and enterprise\n            productivity by at least 17 percent over the life of the\n            project and had increased the household incomes of\n            smallholder farmers and their families by about 21 percent\n            in 124 communities by improving their access to agriculture\n            and related support services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -

There are six project components.\n            Component 1 increases active community participation and\n            self-reliance in the planning processes of Agrarian Reform\n            Communities (ARC) and in implementing integrated\n            community-identified priorities. It also builds the capacity\n            of ARC peoples organizations, such as the\n            \"barangay\" implementing team, cooperatives,\n            associations, farmers' groups, women's groups,\n            producer groups, as well as strengthening the capacity of\n            DAR and LGUs to support appropriate development activities.\n            Component 2 provides essential rural infrastructure which\n            contributes directly to sustaining increases in rural\n            incomes of the target beneficiaries based on community\n            demand-driven approach. The infrastructure includes rural\n            roads, bridges, small-scale irrigation, potable water supply\n            systems, post-harvesting facilities, and social buildings.\n            Component 3 provides strategic support services to help\n            generate viable increases in agricultural productivity and\n            diversification. Component 4 comprises capacity building\n            support to cooperatives and micrfinance institutions.\n            Components 5 and 6 provide implementation and project\n            management support, respectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
