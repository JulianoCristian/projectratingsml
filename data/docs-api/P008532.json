A number of lessons address the\n            following: 1) The significance of competent counterpart\n            cannot be emphasized enough, for success is greatly\n            facilitated by competent staff, exemplified by the Latvian\n            Road Administration (LAR), and Ministry of Transport\n            competencies. 2) Likewise, a maximum degree of competition\n            is necessary to attain efficient contract works, proven by\n            the introduction of international competitive bidding, which\n            intensified competition, reducing unit costs by thirty\n            percent over the life of the project. This is best achieved\n            in road operations, when both local, and international firms\n            compete, but with bidding packages sufficiently subdivided,\n            so that local firms with limited financial capacity, can\n            also participate. 3) As experience indicates, project\n            simplicity leads to success. This was reflected by the\n            project's single counterpart agency, LAR, responsible\n            for implementation of project components, which simplified\n            both preparation, and supervision. 4) The \"second\n            generation\" Road Fund in Latvia, demonstrated the\n            recognition, and support of the public, while placing road\n            management on a sound commercial basis, fostering an\n            important role in meeting European integration requirements.\n            5) The involvement of highly developed countries in\n            Bank-financed projects, prods international integration,\n            given the availability of grants for technical assistance to\n            support reform, thus re-integrating the economy into the\n            international community."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia -
