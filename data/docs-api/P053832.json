Institutional\n            lessons suggest that financial incentives, and heavy\n            reliance on effectiveness, and disbursement conditions,\n            require the support of an overriding framework of\n            macroeconomic, or sectoral reforms, i.e., broader framework\n            for reform of the agricultural, financial, or rural finance\n            sectors, to mobilize the support needed to implement\n            ambitious reform programs, and, in addition, the existing\n            capacity of the implementing agency should be taken into\n            consideration early on. Projects designed as a banking\n            reform project, should be implemented as such, and not as\n            rural credit or rural development project, with the\n            appropriate resources and skills mix made available as\n            required. Operational lessons reinforce that lack of\n            commitment to aspects of projects, should be clearly and\n            timely reported by task teams, supervision efforts need to\n            re-build project understanding and commitment, and the task\n            team should timely, and proactively assess needed corrective\n            measures. Supervision efforts should complete project\n            preparation, as necessary, before embarking on\n            implementation. Moreover, involvement of second tier\n            officials in project preparation should protect project\n            ownership, and implementation from staff turnover risks,\n            while clear project legal documents, and its consistency\n            with the appraisal, would help maintain implementation\n            momentum, should a high turnover of leadership occur."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Private Sector and Agriculture\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Private Sector and\n            Agriculture Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5680809/egypt-private-sector-agriculture-development-project","projn":"EG-Egypt - Private Sector And Agriculture\n            Development -- P053832","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Business Environment,Business in Development,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050322104115"},"subsc":"Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Banking","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, African Development Bank,\n            allocation of resources, Bank lending, Bank Performance,\n            banking reform, Borrower, borrowing, Capital adequacy,\n            Capital adequacy ratio, commitment, commitment charge,\n            conditionality, Credit, credit institutions, CURRENCY,\n            disbursement, Disbursement Arrangements, disbursement\n            conditions, disbursements, economic growth, economic\n            reforms, employment, Expenditure, financial analysis,\n            Financial incentives, financial indicators, financial\n            institutions, financial intermediary, financial\n            intermediation, Financial rate of return, financial\n            resources, financial sector, financial sector development,\n            financial sector reform, financial services, financial\n            statements, financial systems, foreign exchange, front end,\n            guidelines, IDA credit, Impact Indicators, income,\n            Institutional Development, institutional reform,\n            international accounting standards, International\n            Development, International Finance, intervention, investment\n            funds, investment lending, legal framework, Lessons Learned,\n            liquidity, living standards, LOAN, loan accounting, Loan\n            Agreement, loan agreements, loan documentation, loan\n            effectiveness, loan size, loan supervision, Management\n            information systems, marketing, ozone, PCD, portfolio,\n            portfolio management, portfolio quality, PRIVATE SECTOR,\n            privatization, profitability, Project Costs, project\n            identification, Project Implementation, project preparation,\n            public sector, regional banks, ROA, savings, trading,\n            tranche, unemployment, waste,"}},"owner":"Djibouti,Egypt,Yemen (MNC03)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF037164-EGYPT - PRIVATE SECTOR &\n            AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF037489-EGYPT, ARAB REPUBLIC - PRVT.\n            SECT.
