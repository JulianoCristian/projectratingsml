Some lessons learned included:\n            donor coordination can be critical for improving fiscal and\n            institutional capacity of governments and efficiency and\n            effectiveness of social safety nets. Commitments of\n            technical and financial support from donors are most\n            effective when donors align around a common framework and\n            principles for engaging with government. The role of social\n            safety nets in a particular country context evolves over\n            time as SSN institutions are created and the capacity to\n            identify different subgroups of poor and vulnerable\n            households expands. Whereas initially the project was\n            designed to address regular shocks in rural areas leading to\n            annual emergency food appeals, the dialogue has evolved\n            towards programming options to address two different types\n            of poor, rural households: those with longer term potential\n            to graduate out of poverty and those who face chronic\n            challenges. Contingency funds serve a critical role enabling\n            government to scale up safety nets both in terms of transfer\n            size and coverage to address transitory shocks, even in low\n            income countries. Both cash and food transfers can be\n            appropriate depending on specific circumstances, such as the\n            level of seasonal variability in food prices, and it is\n            important to be pragmatic about what mix of transfer types\n            is best. Whatever transfer type, predictability is critical.\n            Achieving timely transfers in low income settings is\n            possible but requires investments in capacity building and\n            continuous monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Productive Safety Nets Project (APL1)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Productive Safety Nets\n            Project

Productive Safety Nets Project (APL1)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall outcome of the Productive\n            Safety Nets Project (PSNP) Project for Ethiopia was rated\n            satisfactory, the risk to the development outcome was\n            substantial, and the performance of the Bank and Borrower\n            was also rated as satisfactory. The PSNP is a flagship for\n            what can be done to smooth consumption and protect the most\n            vulnerable in a very low-income country. However, the\n            Ethiopian experience is highly contextualized upon the\n            country's twenty year experience with significant\n            amounts of humanitarian relief assistance. In such an\n            environment, the main issue is to reduce distortions and\n            dependency while shifting from emergency food aid to a\n            greater developmental impact. Nonetheless, several lessons\n            from Ethiopia may be relevant to other countries, divided\n            into general design, operational and donor coordination\n            aspects: (a) the extensive analytical underpinning and\n            technical inputs, both at the design stage and during\n            implementation, were critical to program success. The bold\n            policy vision of the PSNP had to be built on a sound and\n            shared understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the\n            present system and clarity on the nature of the problem to\n            be addressed. Complex and high risk reforms such as those\n            embodied in this operation are much more likely to succeed\n            if this foundation is present; and (b) the use of existing\n            Government channels and institutional structures builds\n            ownership but presents capacity issues that need to be\n            addressed. Weaknesses, gaps, and capacity constraints in the\n            overall functioning of government structures need to be\n            strategically addressed upfront. Relying on broad civil\n            service reforms, like changes in salaries and hiring and\n            firing rules, will not ease constraints in the short-term.\n            With the caveat that very few countries besides Ethiopia\n            have the type of existing bureaucratic structure around\n            massive delivery of food aid upon which to piggyback a\n            safety net

Detailed\n            mitigating measures recommended to offset adverse impacts\n            for specific types of sub-project will be integrated into\n            the technical specifications, work norms and information\n            kits guiding the implementation of the public works under\n            the PSNP. Training materials and technical specifications,\n            work norms, and information kits will be the primary tool to\n            incorporate mitigation measures and to minimize adverse\n            effects. Training may be needed in developing a basic\n            watershed or catchment area plan and design and sequencing\n            of integrated subprojects for soil and water conservation\n            and watershed regeneration, including: Gully treatment\n            prescriptions, water harvesting structures, rooftop\n            catchment systems, appropriate irrigation technologies,\n            terracing and bunding methods, check dams and other control\n            structures, biological measures for soil and water\n            conservation, and plantation methods and management for\n            effective soil conservation. In order to facilitate the\n            environmental management of medical wastes associated with\n            rehabilitation of rural clinics, a Medical Waste Management\n            Guide for Rural Health Centres will be produced by the PSNP,\n            to establish the process for preparation of waste management\n            plans. Similar guidance will be provided for the development\n            of Integrated Pest Management plans, in connection with\n            projects involving small scale irrigation systems. Farmers\n            may need training on managing the increased number of\n            inputs, including fertilizers, pesticides and their\n            alternatives, management of these systems, the development\n            of water user committees and follow-up extension support to\n            assist farmers and DAs in developing irrigated agriculture,\n            and managing the environmental aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -

The project has the following two components:\n            Component 1) Labor-intensive public work will provide grants\n            to households whose adults participate in public works\n            sub-projects. Sub-projects to be undertaken as part of\n            public works will be determined locally by the beneficiary\n            communities through an annual, participatory planning\n            process. Direct support will provide grants to households\n            who are labor-poor and cannot undertake public works.\n            Component 2) This component will focus on strengthening all\n            aspects of program implementation, including (i) capacity\n            building at community level to strengthen beneficiary\n            identification and local level planning, financial\n            management, procurement and technical training at woreda and\n            regional level to ensure that all sub-projects are\n            appropriately designed and rapid response mechanisms are in\n            place to ensure smooth program implementation; (ii) support\n            to the development of a monitoring and evaluation framework\n            and a program MIS. This includes the implementation of a\n            beneficiary survey, and a detailed program process survey\n            after the first 12 months. It will also finance several\n            additional studies as part of the shift to the second phase\n            of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL); and (iii) procurement\n            of essential goods and services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -  Productive Safety Net Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia -  Productive Safety Net Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/11/5303293/ethiopia-productive-safety-net-project","projn":"ET-Productive Safety Nets Project (Apl 1) -- P087707","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Food & Nutrition Policy,Poverty Assessment,Food & Beverage Industry,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Ethiopia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041109102106"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"AFT: Human Development 3 (AFTH3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF030622-IDA CONSULTANTS POOLED CTF - FY05","repnb":"29767"},"facets":{}}}
