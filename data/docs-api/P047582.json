Project sustainability is assessed\n            as likely for the reforms as a whole. Overall World Bank\n            performance was satisfactory despite the modest results with\n            the medium-term components of the program. The overall\n            performance of the Borrower was modest. This program was\n            highly distinctive in that it was a quick, disbursing,\n            single-tranche operation, and one of the first of its kind\n            in the region in terms of content. At the same time it was\n            negotiated with a government team that changed in\n            mid-program. Several lessons can be drawn: The Bank should\n            re-examine the instruments it uses for loan programs where\n            reforms are politically sensitive and will require a long\n            period of gestation. The Bank should in the future wait for\n            essential legislative measures to be adopted before taking\n            the project to the Board. The Bank must be able to adapt to\n            shifts of content and if necessary, revise its expectations\n            regarding the degree of Borrower commitment when the\n            officials with whom it has to deal change during the course\n            of the loan. The Bank should also be more realistic about\n            the length of time needed for such a far-reaching reform\n            program. Reform of a pension system has to be based on\n            actuarial studies and these require access to solid data; in\n            this case, these conditions were not fulfilled and the Bank\n            needed to allow for the time and cost required to\n            reconstitute such data."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -

The\n            second component launches actuarial studies and external\n            audits of the existing pension system; appoints a pension\n            reform committee; and authorizes independent management of\n            pension fund reserves. The third component introduces\n            segregated portfolios for the deposits associated with the\n            national social security fund (CNSS) and the national\n            savings fund (CEN); and replaces the fixed administered rate\n            on deposits with portfolio returns from investments.
