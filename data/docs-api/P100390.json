Some\n            lessons learned includes: implementation arrangements. The\n            implementation arrangements with a field-based project unit\n            in Puttalam helped to address the needs of the Internally\n            Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Puttalam in a timely manner.\n            However, the project demonstrated that effective\n            implementation through this model requires a well\n            capacitated project unit coupled with effective coordination\n            at the center. Planning for integrated investments, housing,\n            water, sanitation, and roads relate closely to each other\n            and thus, any interventions that provide these services in a\n            package require integrated planning covering technical\n            design aspects, staffing, and sequencing of implementation.\n            Owner-driven construction, this ICR recognizes the\n            challenges that were faced by the home-owners in undertaking\n            housing construction as per schedule, but the experience\n            seemed to have been appreciated by the owners. The provision\n            of cash grants ensured beneficiary participation in the\n            construction of their houses, facilitated choice in design\n            and use of construction materials, and reduced the cost of\n            construction. Technical officers supervised construction\n            while a technical audit independently monitored compliance\n            with engineering standards. Job training program/skills\n            development is one of the important activities of the PHP\n            was to create required construction skills among the\n            Puttalam IDPs. The skills training program was designed to\n            meet the demand for skilled and semi-skilled masons and\n            carpenters in project areas. Community involvement in water\n            supply investments is one of the institutional mechanisms\n            for social integration that worked well under the project\n            was the formation of Community Based Organization (CBOs) for\n            managing water supply schemes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

This change is intended to facilitate improvement\n            of social cohesion within communities served under the\n            project by addressing the housing needs of a group of the\n            poorest non-IDP households. This will promote the\n            integration of the IDPs into host communities. The basis for\n            selection of IDP beneficiaries for a housing cash grant will\n            be expanded beyond the list of original eligible\n            beneficiaries identified by the United Nations High\n            Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 2006 survey. After the\n            project approval, the Government pointed out that the UNHCR\n            2006 survey had omitted those IDP households who in fact had\n            a temporary house but were classified as those without a\n            temporary house and, therefore, had been omitted from the\n            list. The Government found, through surveys and an\n            Independent Housing Damage Assessment (IHDA), that a number\n            of deserving families met the selection criteria and that\n            the proportion of the temporary houses and semi-built houses\n            is slightly different from that surveyed by the UNHCR 2006\n            survey. The Ministry of Resettlement requested IDA to\n            consider these beneficiaries under the project and to accept\n            the Ministry's survey as a complementary tool to the\n            UNHCR 2006 survey for verification of beneficiaries eligible\n            for housing grant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
