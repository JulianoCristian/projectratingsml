Key lessons learned from the\n            implementation include: It is important to adequately take\n            into account the political economy of the evolving\n            situation. Delays in implementing certain of the agreed\n            measures did lead to some reduction in effectiveness of the\n            program supported under the SAC. Improved public expenditure\n            management requires fundamental change in the\n            Government's range of commitments. Post-privatization\n            market development and support are needed to help contribute\n            more quickly to an upswing in agricultural production and\n            the development of rural wealth. For energy, as in the past\n            the priority must be to bring in more competent private\n            operators who have the technical know-how and financial\n            resources to restore sector efficiency. Delays in\n            privatization of attractive state enterprises, even in the\n            fact of strong political opposition, should be avoided if at\n            all

To achieve this goal, the SAC III is designed to\n            carry forward the reform program started under the Second\n            Structural Adjustment Loan Project (SAL II)(report number\n            P7139). SAL II focused on four areas: pension reform; land\n            privatization and farm restructuring; unbundling the energy\n            enterprises and starting the process of privatization; and\n            enterprise privatization, particularly on a small scale. SAC\n            III will focus on continuing the privatization process in\n            agriculture, energy, and the enterprise sector. In\n            agriculture, the focus will be on maintaining momentum for\n            land reform, supporting new private farmers, and laying the\n            foundations for a restructuring of agro-processing. In\n            energy, the Credit will support completion of the\n            privatization process for electricity distribution companies\n            as well as substantive progress towards privatizing the\n            electricity generation companies and the gas company. It\n            will also initiate a process that should lead to privatizing\n            the district heating companies. Finally, the Credit will\n            support implementation of a new enterprise privatization\n            program covering the years 1999-2000 which will emphasize\n            the importance of attracting strategic investors to Moldova.\n            The Credit will be released in two tranches."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Second Structural Adjustment\n            Credit
