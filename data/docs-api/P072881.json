Some lessons learned\n            included: payment systems are technically complex and can\n            take a long time to implement. The projects require Bank and\n            Government teams with specialized skills both in designing\n            the project and throughout supervision. Because of their\n            technical elements these projects can take time to implement\n            and the Bank norm of four years for project disbursements\n            may be too short. Projects covering all countries of a\n            regional monetary union are the most efficient approach to\n            putting in place a payment system. There may also be some\n            advantages to the regional approach in upgrading payments\n            systems for economic groupings that do not have a single\n            central bank. The capacity in financial management and\n            procurement should be in place before the startup of the\n            project. This applies to all projects, but it is\n            particularly important for technically complex ones and\n            those to be implemented by institutions which have no prior\n            experience in Bank projects. The delays in putting in place\n            the team at BEAC delayed the startup of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central Africa - BEAC Regional Payments\n            System

      security of the payment system in the Central African\n            Economic and Monetary Union. The project has eight main\n            components. The Global Project Management component\n            coordinates and implements the reform process, providing\n            stakeholders with all needed information, communication, and\n            training programs. The Electronic Bulk Payment Clearing\n            Systems component manages the exchange and clearing process\n            of bulk payments transactions, including the transformation\n            of paper instruments into elctronic data. Identical\n            electronic clearing systems will be installed in each\n            country. A Real Time Gross Settlement mechansim (RTGS)\n            enables instant and final irrevocable settlement of\n            individual large value and other time criticial\n            transactions, among other activities.

A Payment Risk\n            Management System collects all informaton regarding payment\n            incidents for individuals and companies, enabling a better\n            control over unreliable customers' operations, and\n            providing access to critical information to credit\n            institutions and banks. Telecommunications infrastructure\n            ensures high-quality, low-cost transfers of data and payment\n            transactions among all locations.
