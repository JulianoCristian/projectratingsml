Some\n            lessons learned included: when the global financial crisis\n            erupted in September 2008 and the government asked the Bank\n            for urgent financial support, the Bank was able to come\n            through in record time. The capability to respond quickly to\n            changing country and/or international conditions is\n            essential for maintaining the relevance of the Bank and for\n            its relationship with its clients, particularly with the\n            middle-income countries. The design of the policy matrix\n            balanced ambition and breadth with a focus on areas with\n            strong government commitment. Striking such a balance at the\n            beginning of the series is not an easy task. On the one\n            hand, setting out to do only the reforms that are most\n            likely to be achieved would make for a more satisfactory\n            performance at the end of the program. On the other hand, it\n            is most beneficial if the program can be used to push\n            forward difficult reforms. While a small fraction of the\n            outcomes in the FMCDPL program were not achieved, resulting\n            in only satisfactory performance, the work that took place\n            in the less successful areas had moved the agenda forward\n            and prepared the ground for future reforms, which are being\n            continued and implemented at this time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - First and Second Programmatic Fiscal\n            Management and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - First and Second\n            Programmatic Fiscal Management and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16518715/peru-first-second-programmatic-fiscal-management-competitiveness-development-policy-loan-project","projn":"PE-Third Programmatic Fiscal Management\n            & Comp.

The\n            FMCDPL series, along with parallel DPL in the areas of\n            social policy and environment, were designed in close\n            partnership with Government of Peru (GoP) and in line with\n            its policy program, as outlined in the Country Partnership\n            Strategy (CPS). The GoP stated a clear vision for: (i)\n            building on recent economic successes to achieve higher\n            growth and better social outcomes; (ii) constructing a\n            better social contract between the government and citizens\n            based on effective social development; and (iii) modernizing\n            state institutions. This FMCDPL programmatic series has been\n            prepared at the request of President Garcia's\n            administration. It has been designed to support Peru's\n            own program. Unlike the previous two loans in the series,\n            this third operation includes policies to deal with\n            short-term issues such the effects of the global crisis,\n            while maintaining momentum in the implementation of reforms\n            that address structural issues and which will have\n            medium-term effects. The operation supports the GoP efforts\n            in the context of a global economic slowdown. The\n            development objective of the loan is to contribute to growth\n            and poverty alleviation by supporting two main policy areas:\n            (a) quality of fiscal management; and (b) competitiveness.\n            Peru entered the global crisis in a solid position and has\n            managed its challenges well. Good macroeconomic fundamentals\n            and appropriate policy responses to the crisis moderate the\n            negative impact of weaker external demand and external\n            shocks. Aware of the downside risks to economic growth as\n            well to poverty and employment, the GoP has implemented\n            counter-cyclical policies to mitigate the impact of the\n            crisis. Nonetheless, the GoP has not lost sight of the\n            medium-term objectives of its reform agenda, and has\n            continued to make progress in improving the effectiveness of\n            fiscal management and supporting the country's\n            competitiveness and integration into the global economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Third Programmatic Fiscal Management\n            and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Third Programmatic Fiscal\n            Management and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/09/11246573/peru-third-programmatic-fiscal-management-competitiveness-development-policy-loan-program","projn":"PE-Third Programmatic Fiscal Management\n            & Comp.
