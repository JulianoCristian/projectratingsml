The changes in project scope and components are\n            required due to the challenging political and security\n            conditions in the country after project effectiveness. As a\n            result of this context, implementation was significantly\n            delayed, and the number of project sites was reduced. The\n            restructuring will result in cancellation of US$2.7 million\n            of the grant proceeds and reallocation of the remaining\n            amount to the revised activities. This restructuring will\n            require an extension of the project closing date to June 30,\n            2010, as agreed with the Ministry of Health (MOH). The\n            project development objective (PDO) has been revised, as\n            follows: to improve access of the disabled population in the\n            targeted areas in Iraq to rehabilitation and prosthetic\n            services. This will be carried out by: (i) constructing new\n            facilities and workshops and equipping them; (ii) upgrading\n            technical skills of the service providers; and (iii)\n            providing medical aids to the disabled persons. The\n            restructured project is expected to result in: (a) an\n            increase in the number of disabled using the newly\n            constructed and equipped facilities, and (b) an

Potential adverse impacts\n            would be mitigated as follows: To prevent disease caused by\n            poor water quality/contamination, prioritize leak detection\n            and repair pipe networks, test chemical and bacterial\n            content of water content prior to installation of new\n            sources and redesign if found to be contaminated, monitor\n            sources, place apron and drainage around tubewells and dug\n            wells to prevent formation of stagnant pools, provide cover\n            and hand-pump to prevent contamination of dug wells, locate\n            pit latrines more than 10m from any water source and seal\n            and separate base by at least 2m of sand or loamy soil from\n            the groundwater table, seal night soil latrines or septic\n            tanks, and drain outflows either to a soak away located at\n            least 10m from any water source or connect it to a working\n            drain. To prevent water depletion, use water use planning\n            and include community participation of downstream water\n            users, establish user rights through focus groups, and use\n            archeological chance find procedures when uncovering\n            cultural property. To reduce disease caused by excreta\n            disposal or improper latrine use, wear protective clothing\n            and use containers for night soil transport, treat waste and\n            store in sunlight for sufficient period to destroy\n            pathogens, and provide health and hygiene education and\n            awareness. Minimize health risks from insects, rats, waste\n            burning , medical waste, and odors by frequent collection,\n            waste containment, separation at source-especially for\n            medical and hazardous waste, minimize burning, prevent\n            illegal dumping, incorporate dumping bays for safe access\n            for rag pickers, invest in final disposal site, and provide\n            daily soil covering. To prevent drainage disruption, erosion\n            loss of vegetation and of access fro road construction,\n            provide cascades, steps, and check dams; balance cut and\n            fill, revegetate, restore borrow areas, construct in the dry\n            season, protect soil surfaces, use turfing and create slope\n            breaks, provide alternate road alignments, provide fuel to\n            prevent firewood use, and properly dispose of oil and\n            bitumen. To reduce deforestation, injury from earthquake,\n            and injury from dam failure, use fired bricks, apply\n            low-cost seismic structural designs, apply dam safety\n            measures, and use watering and compaction for earthen dams.\n            To offset impacts associated with power generation, use\n            cleanest fuel economically available, contain spills, use\n            sound-proofing, and store coolant oil in sealed containers,\n            make population aware of electrocution dangers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iraq -
