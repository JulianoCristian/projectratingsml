Some\n            lessons learned included:  in an environment where the\n            reform agenda was slowing down the team focused on areas\n            that had more consensus to move forward. The DPL focused on\n            achieving feasible reforms in the near term while laying the\n            necessary building blocks to accelerate reforms in the\n            medium term. Because public sector reforms would require\n            consensus between diverse stakeholders and would affect the\n            political equilibrium, the government continued to take a\n            strategically incremental approach.  The balanced approach\n            in the preparation of the operations between Social\n            Protections and Competitiveness translated in positive\n            results as provided the government with a set of reforms\n            that reinforced each other (i.e. impact of some trade\n            reforms might be partially compensated by reforms on the\n            social protection system). The loan was designed to include\n            a certain degree of flexibility to allow the government to\n            adapt the reform program as needed over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius -

objective of the First\n            Public Sector Performance Development Policy Loan (DPL)\n            Program for Mauritius to support improvements in the\n            performance of the public sector in Mauritius. Recent\n            economic reforms in Mauritius have built on a long tradition\n            of economic growth and transformation. Since independence in\n            1968, Mauritius has achieved substantial economic growth of\n            around 5 percent per annum, which has underpinned its\n            economic transition from a predominantly agricultural\n            economy based on sugar production to a diversified economy\n            structured around textile exports and tourism. However, by\n            the mid- 2000s, with the erosion of Mauritius'\n            preferential trade status and rising commodity prices, it\n            was evident that more reforms were needed to further the\n            country's transition from a labor intensive economy to\n            a high-value-added knowledge and services economy. As a\n            result, in 2006 the government implemented a bold reform\n            program structured around four pillars: (i) strengthening\n            fiscal consolidation and public sector efficiency; (ii)\n            enhancing trade competitiveness; (iii) improving the\n            investment climate; and (iv)widening opportunities. The\n            reform was broadly successful in restoring competitiveness,\n            achieving economic growth, and creating employment in\n            higher-value-added sectors. Moreover, the reform helped to\n            consolidate government expenditure and reversed the upward\n            trend in public debt. The proposed DPL is being prepared in\n            coordination with the Bank's Private Sector\n            Competitiveness (PSC) DPL. The two DPL series are designed\n            to be mutually reinforcing and to address complementary\n            aspects of the government's reform program while\n            ensuring that the Bank's support remains sufficiently\n            flexible. The PSC DPL series will focus primarily on\n            strengthening the policy and institutional environment for\n            private sector competitiveness, while this proposed DPL will\n            focus primarily on the performance of the public sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius - First Public Sector Performance\n            Development Policy Loan
