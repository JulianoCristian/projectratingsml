Conditionalities attached to IMF\n            stand-by agreement and in the Bank adjustment loans were\n            effective in getting the Government to tackle some of the\n            most difficult sector issues such as that of nonpayment in\n            the gas sector. Another important observation is that\n            supervision of the loan provides a very effective way of\n            gaining intimate knowledge of sector issues and this\n            knowledge translates into sound advice to the Bank (and the\n            IMF) on conditions for adjustment loans (and stand-by\n            arrangements). Another lesson is to be ready to take\n            advantage of all opportunities to push the reform agenda.\n            Following the start of Romania accession negotiations with\n            the EU in 2000, harmonization of sector policies with EU\n            requirements have taken on greater urgency. The Bank team\n            supervising this project were able to provide the Government\n            with advice on how to accommodate the EU's goals for\n            the sector as outlined in their Gas Initiative. Although the\n            Bank knew that unbundling Regie Autonome for Natural Gas\n            (ROMGAZ) would delay the implementation of the component,\n            the Bank decided to support the move because of the long\n            term importance of creating a sound industry structure.\n            World Bank teams working in Romania should take great care\n            in assuring that any studies developed, information\n            generated etc. is shared by all parties involved in a\n            particular project. Particular efforts should be exercised\n            by Task Teams to insure all parties who could or should\n            benefit from information generated during project\n            preparation and implementation, in fact, receive this information."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Petroleum Sector\n
