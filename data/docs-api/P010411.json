The project achieved its major objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, it is important to develop\n            a realistic project implementation time schedule.\n            Procurement of services and goods prior to loan\n            effectiveness can obviate serious delays at the outset of\n            the project and credit extensions necessitated to simply\n            complete original scopes of work. In addition, a clear\n            understanding by borrowers of local and ICB procurement\n            procedures is critical prior to loan effectiveness. Second,\n            the inter-phasing of borrower data collection, consultant\n            services, and equipment procurement/field investigations is\n            critical to avoid interruptions in technical assistance\n            inputs and scheduling. Finally, in coal-producing countries\n            world-wide, it is important to develop a clear and effective\n            policy, regulatory, and institutional arrangement for\n            environmental or social management. Also, there is a need\n            for and benefit of fiscal policies making provisions of\n            funds for environmental and social mitigation programs\n            necessitated by the impact of historically uncontrolled\n            mining activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
