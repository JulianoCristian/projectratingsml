The objectives of the TIP were to: (a)\n            improve land transport through the reconstruction, upgrading\n            and maintenance of national roads, and the reduction of\n            vehicle operating costs;( b) enhance air transport through\n            ground equipment replacement, improvement of safety\n            standards and resealing and regravelling of air\n            strips,taxiways and aprons;( c) improve efficiency of road\n            maintenance through the provision of road maintenanc\n            equipment and materials;and (d) strengthen the sector\n            institutions and improve of the domestic construction\n            industry through provision of technical advisory services\n            and training of local staff. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was deficient. The\n            key lessons learned were as follows: (i) within the\n            customary and cultural procedures for acquiring land the\n            State needs to develop a system which will remove the\n            situations which disrupt all aspects of infrastructur\n            development; (ii) when a loan is agreed to, the commitment\n            of the Borrower to provide its share of the funds has to be\n            maintained; and (iii) depending on the number of World Bank\n            Loans current in Papua New Guinea at any one time,\n            application and administration of the loan could be improved\n            by the presence of an authorised Bank representative in\n            Papua New Guinea."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Transport
