Some lessons learned\n            included: to ensure intersectoral coordination, a champion\n            is imperative. To ensure that interinstitutional\n            coordination efforts are sustained throughout program\n            implementation and beyond, it is essential that an entity\n            take a leading role in overseeing these efforts,\n            particularly as participating entities undergo an initial\n            learning process and define their functions within\n            intersectoral working groups. Finance Secretariat (SHCP) and\n            Environment and Natural Resources Secretariat (SEMARNAT)\n            assumed this coordinating role, helping to ensure the\n            success of the Program's coordination efforts. A\n            relevant set of monitorable and meaningful outcome\n            indicators should be established at the outset of a program,\n            along with clearly-defined baseline and target values to\n            monitor progress and evaluate outcomes. Some of the\n            indicators established for the Environment DPL Program were\n            overly complex and ambitious. Further, although target\n            values were defined during the course of program\n            implementation, the lack of a definition of baseline and\n            target values at the outset made it more difficult to assess\n            the program's overall progress during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - First Programmatic Environment\n            Structural Adjustment Loan

They are: 1) Quickly capitalizing on narrow\n            windows of political opportunity to accelerate the\n            Bank's processing o f large environmental\n            infrastructure operations can be highly risky, since it can\n            lead, as it did under the NBEP, to over-ambitious design,\n            inadequately prepared implementing agencies and poor overall\n            quality at entry, especially when political considerations\n            are allowed to drive the preparation and appraisal\n            timetable. 2) Targeting project support for local agencies\n            in more direct ways helps them assume more responsibilities\n            and contribute in more measurable ways to environmental\n            sustainability. This support needs to be concrete and under\n            their control. In contrast, \"top-down\" approaches\n            tend to focus on the broader enabling environment, but may\n            neglect the lack of skills and resources at local levels. 3)\n            In cases where the processing triggers for the programmatic\n            loans are different from interim results and final outcomes,\n            these triggers should be clearly distinguished in the\n            simplified Implementation Completion Reports. 4) Prior\n            Government commitment and formal policies as well as a\n            time-based plan are crucial prerequisites for the successful\n            implementation of Environmental Development Policy Loans.\n            Desired policy outcomes and practical constraints need to be\n            clear in order to enhance dialogue and promote synergies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Proyecto Ambiental de la Frontera\n            Norte y de Ajuste Estructural Ambiental"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"M\u00e9xico \u2013 Proyecto Ambiental de la\n            Frontera Norte y Proyecto Medioambiental en el marco del\n            Pr\u00e9stamo de Ajuste Estructural : M\u00e9xico - Proyecto Ambiental\n            de la Frontera Norte y de Ajuste Estructural Ambiental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/07/6341127/mexico-northern-border-environment-project-environmental-structural-adjustment-loan-project-mexico-proyecto-ambiental-de-la-frontera-norte-y-de-ajuste-estructural-ambiental","projn":"MX-N.

Environment Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project, supports the first stage of\n            Mexico's medium-term outcome-based program to promote\n            sustainable development, and to mainstream environmental\n            concerns in water, forestry, energy and tourism sectors.\n            Mexico has met all the conditions of this operation, with\n            the exception of three conditions, which have been met for\n            the most part. Partial waivers are sought for these\n            conditions: a) condition 1: the establishment of\n            Inter-sectoral Technical Working Groups (ITWGs) in water,\n            energy, tourism, and forestry; b) condition 8: ISO-9001-2000\n            certification of certain environmental impact assessment\n            (EIA) review and approval, forest fire detection and\n            control, and permit-issuance functions of the Ministry of\n            Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) that are to be\n            decentralized to the state governments from SEMARNAT; and,\n            c) condition 11: public disclosure of processing information\n            of certain permits. Condition 1: the ITWGs have all been\n            established and are functional. However, technically, a\n            partial waiver is needed and warranted, given changes, in\n            some cases, to ensure more appropriate representation in the\n            ITWG than was originally envisaged during project\n            preparation were needed, and also, because the agency in\n            question underwent reorganization changes. Conditions 8 and\n            11: the majority of functions related to EIA review,\n            approval and permits, have been certified, and processing\n            information of related permits is disclosed on public\n            websites. The exceptions relate to forest fire detection and\n            control (which was transferred out of SEMARNAT to the\n            Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) following approval of a new\n            Forestry Law) and, non-timber reporting (Permit No.\n            SEMARNAT-03-005). The latter is likely to be delayed, since\n            a complete review of permitting procedures is being\n            conducted, and seemingly, some permits will be combined.\n            Therefore it makes more sense to await completion of this\n            review, prior to embarking on certification, and/or\n            disclosure of permitting procedures. Based on the assessment\n            that the objectives of the program have been met in\n            substance, and that all conditions have been met with the\n            exception of three conditions requiring minor partial\n            waivers, it is proposed that the Second Tranche be made available."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

The project will\n            support the establishment of technical coordination\n            mechanisms with other sectors, mainstreaming environmental\n            issues in sectoral policy, and, by designing fiscal\n            instruments to promote payment of municipal water fees,\n            investments in municipal hydraulic works, and generate\n            revenue from the use of national marine protected areas,\n            including reinvestments related with the environmental\n            management of these areas. Furthermore, the project will\n            support the creation of an enabling environment to\n            decentralize federal environmental management functions to\n            the state level, by way of changes to key legislation; by\n            the preparation of a staged decentralization strategy,\n            specifying the criteria with respect to personnel, and\n            goods; and by establishing the use of third party\n            certification, to ensure the decentralization process. An\n            implementation strategy will be developed to improve public\n            access to information on environmental impact assessment,\n            allowing the application of key legislation on the\n            transparency of information. Risks however include\n            vulnerability to external shocks, lack of stakeholder\n            coordination, political constraints to future reforms, and\n            financial resource constraints to decentralization of\n            environmental functions. Nonetheless, risks have been taken\n            into account in project design, emphasizing on coordination,\n            and consensus building, and, Mexico should benefit from the\n            recovery of the US economy, though timing remains uncertain."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Programmatic Environment Structural\n            Adjustment Loan
