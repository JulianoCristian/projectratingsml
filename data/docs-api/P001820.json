The betterment\n            program will ensure all-weather transport on two roads\n            serving the most agriculturally productive and densely\n            populated areas of the country. This project item yields an\n            economic return of about 35percent on the Boghe-Kaedi-Kiffa\n            road in the south, and of about 16percent on the\n            Akjoujt-Atar-Choum road in the north. The pre-investment\n            studies concern improvement of the most heavily trafficked\n            unpaved road in the country.  The project will consist of\n            the following: (a) technical assistance to the Ministry of\n            Equipment; (b) purchase of highway equipment for maintenance\n            and betterment works; (c) continuation of a betterment\n            program on about 365 km of roads; and (d) feasibility study\n            and detailed engineering for construction of the Rosso-Boghe\n            road (200 km), the most heavily trafficked unpaved road in\n            the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Troisieme Projet Routier"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritanie \u2013 Troisi\u00e8me projet\n            routier : Mauritanie\u00a0- Troisi\u00e8me Projet routier"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1974/10/11758961/mauritania-third-highway-project-mauritania-troisieme-projet-routier","projn":"MR-Third Highway Projec -- P001820","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Roads & Highways,Airports and Air Services,Engineering,Municipal Financial Management","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Science and Technology Development,Transport,Urban Development","count":"Mauritania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100208013548"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Science and Technology Development,Transport,Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Drainage; Earthworks; Engineering; Experts;\n            Feasibility studies; Improvement; Maintenance equipment;\n            Road & highway equipment; Roads & highways; Staff\n            training; Transport planning; Trucking,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Drainage; Earthworks; Engineering; Experts;\n            Feasibility studies; Improvement; Maintenance equipment;\n            Road & highway equipment; Roads & highways; Staff\n            training; Transport planning; Trucking,,"}},"owner":"WB Off:Abidjan-F2:CI/BJ/TG/BF/GN (AFCF2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"493","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Troisieme Projet Routier"}}},"facets":{}}}
