The substantial\n            financing it provides should not be used by clients to\n            postpone but to facilitate reforms and necessary\n            adjustments. Hence, a strong reform program is essential.\n            Also, while the bullet repayment feature temporarily\n            relieves repayment and fiscal pressure, it could add to\n            borrower risk of repayment in the future unless it is\n            accompanied by ex-ante provisions equal to the amount\n            required under a standard annual repayment schedule.\n            Repayment options and their pros and cons should, therefore,\n            be discussed at length with the client. Standard repayment\n            schedules should normally be preferred and bullet repayments\n            should be accompanied by a World Bank recommendation (or\n            requirement) to the Borrower to make annual provisions; (4)\n            This operation shows that the World Bank is particularly\n            effective when it promotes the regional and global public\n            good of country-to-country learning during preparation of\n            similar projects in different countries. This is especially\n            the case when testing relatively new instruments as was the\n            case with PBGs. The FYR Macedonia PBG benefitted from\n            consultations the FYR Macedonia government held with the\n            government of Serbia on the costs and benefits and technical\n            details of the operation. The World Bank took an active part\n            in these consultations and encouraged this productive\n            learning. The World Bank team itself has shown that the\n            lessons from the first PBG in the region on Serbia were\n            absorbed and integrated into the design of the FYR Macedonia\n            operation; and (5) Financial sector supervision and\n            regulation can help preserve macroeconomic and financial\n            stability in the face of substantial external shocks and\n            adverse local conditions. At a time when many a country in\n            Europe faced bankruptcy or major interventions of systemic\n            banks, FYR Macedonia\u2019s fiscal and monetary authorities\n            managed to maintain stability by a combination of active\n            monitoring, a focus on stability, and anticipation of the\n            impact of regional shocks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Policy-Based Guarantee Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Policy-Based\n            Guarantee Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/06/26582406/macedonia-policy-based-guarantee-project","projn":"1W-Fyr Macedonia Public Expenditure Pbg\n            (P133791) -- P157216","topic":"Financial Inclusion m1327456 363,Loans and Guarantees m1326516 384,Financial Vulnerability and Risks m1327455 1245","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08446f97a_1_0"},"admreg":"The World Region,The World Region","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"Project Evaluations","topicv3":"Financial Inclusion m1327456 363,Loans and Guarantees m1326516 384,Financial Vulnerability and Risks m1327455 1245","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"IEG Eco Mgt & Country Prog (IEGEC)","repnb":"106177"},"26591031":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/07/26591031/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-public-expenditure-policy-based-guarantee-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2016/07/26591031/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-public-expenditure-policy-based-guarantee-project","new_url":"2016/07/26591031/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-public-expenditure-policy-based-guarantee-project","disclosure_date":"2016-07-21T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-07-22T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-07-22T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b08447f901","chronical_docm_id":"090224b08447f901","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2016/07/22/090224b08447f901/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/Macedonia00for0ed0Guarantee0Project.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2016/07/22/090224b08447f901/1_0/Rendered/PDF/Macedonia00for0ed0Guarantee0Project.pdf","docdt":"2016-06-28T07:34:03Z","datestored":"2016-07-22T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"White cover","versiontyp_key":"1309939","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of -\n            Public Expenditure Policy-based Guarantee Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Public Expenditure\n            Policy-based Guarantee (PBG) Project for Macedonia, former\n            Yugoslav Republic of were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory.

PBGs implemented in a context of\n            challenging macro-fiscal situation and large financing needs\n            need to incorporate a consistent macro-economic framework\n            with necessary macro and fiscal actions for risk mitigation.\n            Positive impact of important public expenditure measures\n            (wage control, reforms in health procurement, and better\n            targeting of social protection) can be eroded if the program\n            lacks an overarching fiscal and debt framework. As FYR\n            Macedonia\u2019s case illustrates, fiscal savings achieved\n            through these important measures can be dissipated by\n            introducing non-priority spending such as ad-hoc pension\n            increases or controversial capital expenditures.

Directors also supported the use of the\n            policy based guarantee to access international capital\n            markets under more favorable terms and at a longer tenor.\n            With regard to risks, Directors noted the potential negative\n            impact of the highly uncertain external economic environment\n            and the risk of stalled progress in the European Union\n            integration which could diminish political and popular\n            support for essential reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of -\n            Public Expenditure Public Based Guarantee Project : summary\n            of discussion"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav\n            Republic of - Public Expenditure Public Based Guarantee\n            Project : summary of discussion"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/01/17591000/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-public-expenditure-public-based-guarantee-project-summary-discussion","projn":"MK-Fyr Macedonia Public Expenditure Pbg -- P133791","docty":"Board Summary","subtopic":"Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and\n            Local Finance Management,Public Sector Expenditure Policy,Decentralization,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20130417110813"},"theme":"Debt management and fiscal sustainability,Social safety nets,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Macroeconomic management,Health system performance","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"Guarantees","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"capital markets, economic recovery, fiscal\n            policy, international capital, international capital\n            markets, macroeconomic stability, payment terms, Public\n            Disclosure, Public Expenditure, Public Expenditure Policy,\n            reform program, service delivery, social protection"}},"owner":"Macroeconomics 2 (ECSP2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Economic management","repnb":"74710"},"17068881":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/12/17068881/former-yugoslav-republic-macedonia-public-expenditure-policy-based-guarantee-program","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/12/17068881/former-yugoslav-republic-macedonia-public-expenditure-policy-based-guarantee-program","new_url":"2012/12/17068881/former-yugoslav-republic-macedonia-public-expenditure-policy-based-guarantee-program","disclosure_date":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-01-24T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/12/13/000386194_20121213003653/Rendered/INDEX/NonAsciiFileName0.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/12/13/000386194_20121213003653/Rendered/PDF/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf","datestored":"2012-12-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-12-05T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -\n            Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the Public\n            Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG) Program for The\n            Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) is to\n            improve the efficiency of public expenditures by\n            strengthening public financial management practices;\n            improving the efficiency of service provision in the health\n            sector; and strengthening social protection and inclusion.\n            This PEPBG states a guarantee in the amount of EUR155\n            million (US$201.5 million equivalent) in support of a\n            commercial loan to the FYR Macedonia. The single tranche\n            operation supports reforms to improve the efficiency of\n            public expenditures and public financial management, to\n            strengthen health systems, and to improve the targeting of\n            social assistance and social inclusion. The PEPBG will help\n            the FYR Macedonia access international financial markets to\n            address an expected financing gap in 2013. In the current\n            difficult financial environment, a partially-secured\n            financing structure would facilitate FYR Macedonia's\n            access to market funding at a longer tenor and under more\n            favorable terms than would otherwise be possible. Beyond the\n            current turmoil, the PEPBG will help FYR Macedonia preserve\n            continued market access at reasonable terms, expand over the\n            medium-term its name in the international financial market\n            and help the domestic financial market to develop. The\n            operation is part of the World Bank's additional\n            crisis-related assistance to FYR Macedonia aimed at\n            mitigating the impact of the renewed Euro zone
