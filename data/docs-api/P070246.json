The project\n            is only three and a half months from its closing date and\n            that the ratification of the restructuring by Poland will\n            take about three months; a twelve-month extension of the\n            project closing date to June 30, 2012 is requested. This\n            extension will ensure that the funds reallocated from the\n            partial credit guarantee facility component to the new\n            Thermo-Modernization (TM) investments component can be fully\n            disbursed and that the studies under the Technical\n            Assistance (TA) component can be completed in time. The\n            requirements for an extension of the closing date are being\n            met: 1) the project objectives continue to be achievable, 2)\n            the performance of the recipient and Bank Gospodarstwa\n            Krajowego (BGK) continue to be satisfactory, 3) BGK has\n            prepared an action plan acceptable to the bank to complete\n            the project in time, and 4) there are no outstanding audit\n            reports for the project. The restructuring will take into\n            account existing institutional and market capacities and\n            will improve progress in meeting the project development\n            objective. Uncommitted funds under the partial credit\n            guarantee will be reallocated to a new support modality for\n            Energy Efficient (EE) investments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Energy Efficiency\n            Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/04/14250376/poland-energy-efficiency-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"PL-Energy Efficiency Gef Project-479922 -- P070246","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Investment and Investment Climate,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets,Energy Production and Transportation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Poland","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20110526002949"},"subsc":"Banking,Primary education,Health,Energy efficiency in Heat and Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Education,Health and other social services,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, application process, approach,\n            balance, bank loan, banks, beneficiaries, beneficiary,\n            budget constraints, capacity building, Capital Grant, carbon\n            dioxide, carbon path, commercial bank, commercial bank loan,\n            commercial banks, commercial lending, commercial terms,\n            cooperatives, Credit Guarantee, Credit Guarantee Facility,\n            credit guarantees, creditworthiness, CURRENCY, debt, debt\n            financing, demand for energy, Disbursements, due diligence,\n            eligibility criteria, eligible investment, emissions\n            reductions, energy audit, energy costs, ENERGY EFFICIENCY,\n            Energy Efficiency Investments, Energy savings, equipment,\n            Exchange Rate, existing liabilities, Expenditure,\n            Expenditures, financial analysis, Financial Management,\n            financial markets, financial statements, financing needs,\n            Flow of Funds, Greenhouse Gas, greenhouse gas emissions,\n            home owners, independent auditor, instrument, investment\n            cost, investment costs, investment in energy efficiency,\n            investments in energy, leverage, Loan, Loan agreement, Loan\n            amount, Loan volume, Local Banks, outstanding loans, Partial\n            Credit, partial guarantee, Partner Bank, Partner Banks,\n            pipeline, portfolio, Procurement, Procurement Plan,\n            reserves, residential buildings, Retroactive Financing,\n            savings, Statement, Technical Assistance, transaction, TRUST\n            FUND, Withdrawal"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF024009-GEF2 PDF BLOCK B - POLAND :\n            KRAKOW ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT,TF051067-ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE\n            ENERGY SERVICES,TF051579-NORWEGIAN TF - SECONDMENT FOR\n            GUNN OLAND,TF054104-GEF3-FSP:POLAND:ENERGY\n            EFFICIENCY PROJECT,TFM51067-ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE\n            ENERGY SERVICES,TFS51067-ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE\n            ENERGY SERVICES","repnb":"61394"},"facets":{}}}
