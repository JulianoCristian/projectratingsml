Some lessons learned included: one important\n            lesson is that in rushing to fulfill conditions agreed with\n            International Financial Institutions (IFI), the authorities\n            can be prone to overcommit themselves. Government often\n            agrees to move on to many areas without realizing the\n            technical and managerial capacity as well as the political\n            capital that is required to deliver on these requests. One\n            mitigating factor is the creation of a steering committee\n            representing the major stakeholders, that is empowered to\n            take hard decisions to move the reform process forward.\n            Ownership of the project by the Ministry of Finance also\n            provides it with strong and empowered leadership. Project\n            design needs to be realistic and simple to ensure effective\n            implementation. In particular, adequate attention should be\n            given to institutional and implementation arrangements,\n            including developing measurable indicators to track progress\n            towards the Project Development Objectives (PDOs).\n            Especially, in a Legal Reform Project, monitoring\n            arrangements pose particular challenges. However, without\n            indicators, an objective assessment of the project is not\n            possible. Increase in judges' knowledge of commercial\n            law, and changes in attitudes rest on interpretations of\n            qualitative factors and are matters on which observers can\n            reasonably differ. In order to avoid such disagreement,\n            projects require monitorable indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Legal and Judicial Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri

The project has three main components. The first\n            component 1) addresses the weaknesses in the legal and\n            regulatory framework that impacts private sector activity\n            adversely and helps obtain expert input to identify and\n            formulate a comprehensive reform policy; 2) strengthens the\n            capacity of the institutions responsible for law reform and\n            legal education in the area of commercial law by providing\n            short-term training and materials, upgrading and introducing\n            courses in the law school, and launching campaigns and\n            disseminating materials to develop public awareness; 3)\n            provides local and international training for lawyers in the\n            Attorney General's office and judges; and 4) develops\n            an automated and on line Legal Information Network (LAWNET),\n            which includes statutes, government regulations, case\n            information/court decisions, and textbook excerpts; and\n            organizes and modernizes the storage and retrieval of\n            related publications. The second component helps the Office\n            of the Registrar of Companies (ORC) improve its\n            administration, management, and regulatory capacities. The\n            third component finances judicial training and faculty\n            development, reorganizes the Judicial Services Commission,\n            introduces model courts, and develops a formal mediation system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Legal and Judicial Reforms Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Legal and Judicial\n            Reforms
