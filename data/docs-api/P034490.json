Investments that cross\n            over different sectors as well as different elected\n            administrations run the risk of disenfranchisement by the\n            incoming administration in some of the participating\n            sectors. Successful projects are built on the foundation of\n            previous, smaller scale interventions. Effective\n            supervisions, looking at both the substantive parts of the\n            project as well as the fiduciary and governance aspects of\n            implementation, are key instruments to continually improve\n            the efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation.\n            The early stages of Trust in Support of the System of\n            Occupational Standards and Certification (CONOCER) where\n            highly inefficient and costly as a result of its\n            supply-driven and untargeted approach. The average\n            certification cost will decrease as a function of\n            decentralizing the 32 licensed certification units,\n            currently all located in Mexico City. The competency-based\n            scheme seems to work more effectively where there exists a\n            clear articulation between the upper technical secondary\n            (UTS) schools and the regional productive sectors,\n            especially the private ones."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Technical Education and Training\n            Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Technical Education and\n            Training Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/10/5278665/mexico-technical-education-training-modernization-project","projn":"MX-Technical Educ/Training -- P034490","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Education Reform and Management,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041105105142"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Vocational training","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement, achievement outcomes,\n            achievements, addition, Adult Education, basic skills,\n            curricula, curriculum, curriculums, decentralization,\n            Economic Costs, education curriculum, Education Law,\n            education sector, Educational Planning, educational\n            services, Employment, enrollment, formal education, Free\n            Trade, information systems, instructors, knowledge economy,\n            labor market, labor relations, learning achievement,\n            learning materials, Lessons Learned, Lifelong Learning,\n            management information systems, Ministries of Finance,\n            mobility, Outputs, PCD, principals, private sector,\n            Productivity, project implementation, project preparation,\n            public sector, Quality Assurance, repetition, repetition\n            rates, resource allocation, school buildings, schools,\n            services sector, skills training, student orientation, study\n            tours, teacher, teacher training, teachers, teaching,\n            teaching modules, TECHNICAL EDUCATION, technical training,\n            Technological Education, tenure, trainees, training\n            programs, training services, unemployed workers,\n            Universities, Vocational training, wages, workers, workplace"}},"owner":"Education Sector (LCSHE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"trustfund":"TF027790-EDUCATION AND TRAINING (EXC.
