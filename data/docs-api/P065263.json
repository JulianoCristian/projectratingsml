The lessons\n            learned indicated that after an emergency of this magnitude,\n            the local government lacked the resources to cope on their\n            own and received little assistance for the first week. Areas\n            affected by disasters need immediate assistance from both,\n            national governments and international agencies. The\n            increased empowerment of beneficiaries enhanced their\n            understanding of their rights, responsibilities, and their\n            capacity to work together to identify priorities and create\n            consensus. Maintaining low overhead costs in the\n            Reconstruction Fund for the Coffee Region (FOREC) was\n            important. Several of the Non-Governmental Organizations\n            lacked sufficient procurement and engineering capacity. The\n            reconstruction program was slow to address the needs of rent\n            households. The use of \"vitrinas inmobiliarias\"\n            was an innovative and effective way of providing large\n            numbers of new housing units by balancing supply and demand.\n            The reconstruction of Barrio Brasilia, in the City of\n            Armenia, which was devastated by the earthquake, provided\n            special lessons in terms of social organization of the\n            community and the use of legal instruments for land titling."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -

The project has five components. The first repairs\n            and reconstructs partially damaged, totally damaged, and\n            structurally damaged housing. It also finances subsidies to\n            homeowners and to displaced renters characterized as\n            vulnerable (heads of household, the elderly, and those in\n            poor health) for new house construction. The second\n            component rebuilds and repairs social infrastructure\n            (schools, health facilities, and community centers) ad\n            provides consultants. The third component rebuilds and\n            repairs damaged water and sewerage, power, and transport\n            systems as well as it invests environmental protection.
