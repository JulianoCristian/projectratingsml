Some lessons learned included:  the\n            non-technical power distribution loss problem in Albania has\n            become deeply rooted in the socio-economic and political\n            fabric of society, as evidenced also in the illegal use of\n            other public utility services such as water. It cannot be\n            resolved by the utility alone but requires strong and\n            consistent support from the Government and legal system as\n            well. The longer illegal consumption is allowed to continue,\n            the harder it will be to significantly reduce or eliminate\n            it. Illegal use of electricity, in turn, makes bill\n            collection from legal electricity users a more difficult\n            task. The twin trends of growing illegal electricity\n            consumption and unpaid electricity bills will cause steadily\n            increasing financial difficulties for the power sector, a\n            growing need for the Government to pay for imported\n            electricity, and a possible major breakdown in the power\n            system.

The project will consist of the following\n            components: an action plan to reduce non-technical power\n            losses, technical assistance and training for the power loss\n            reduction program, and support for institutional reform and\n            strengthening. The action plan includes: transferring the\n            electricity inspectors to the Albanian Electroenergetic\n            Corporation (KESH), increasing their numbers, reorganizing\n            them, improving their equipment and assuring police support\n            if needed; replacing broken or faulty meters in the cities\n            of Tirana, Durres, Elabasan, Shkoder and Vlore, and\n            upgrading meter testing, calibration and repair; improving\n            consumer services management through establishing consumer\n            contracts, creating a better database, carrying out a\n            publicity campaign, and introducing incentive schemes in the\n            distribution entities.
