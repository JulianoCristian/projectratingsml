It is important to carefully select the appropriate\n            procurement and implementation procedures.

The component includes the design and\n            supervision of infrastructure construction. 4) Social\n            infrastructure will finance the reconstruction of public\n            buildings which provide vital social services, including\n            schools, hospitals, recreation centers, and government\n            offices. 5) Project implementation will finance the creation\n            and maintenance of a Project Coordination Unit during the implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria -
