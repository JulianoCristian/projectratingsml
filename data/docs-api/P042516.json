aviation, cocoa and\n            petroleum; and 5) building capacity within the Ministry of\n            Finance and State Enterprises Commission (SEC); and (B) a\n            privatization program, which will focus on: 1) acceleration\n            of the divestiture program using newly-approved procedures;\n            2) contracting out the sale of enterprises to private firms;\n            3) arrangements to address labor redundancies caused by\n            divestiture; 4) arrangements to promote the participation of\n            Ghanaians in the investment opportunities created by\n            divestiture; 5) implementation of a public information and\n            communications strategy, including periodic impact\n            assessments with the participation of key stakeholders; and\n            6) building capacity within the Divestiture Implementation\n            Committee (DIC)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
