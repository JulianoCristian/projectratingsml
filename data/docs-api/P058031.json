Key\n            lessons include: 1) Country knowledge must be maintained\n            even if there is no lending activity. 2) Strong ownership of\n            the reform program by the Government is crucial to its\n            success. 3) The Bank should show flexibility in policy\n            stance in the face of uncertainty and rapidly changing\n            situation. 4) Fiscal flexibility requires increased\n            coordination between Ministry of Finance and line agencies\n            in order to implement the public sector programs. 5)\n            Appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, measures to\n            recapitalize the banking system, strengthening banking\n            supervision, and corporate debt restructuring have played a\n            key role in stemming capital outflows and returning\n            stability to the Malaysian economy. 6) The crisis in\n            Malaysia has brought out strongly the need to account for\n            contingent liabilities arising out of Government guarantees.\n            7) Some form of temporary regulatory easing may be\n            appropriate during crisis times if it can be clearly\n            demonstrated that these regulations are preventing banks\n            from focusing on their key business. 8) Some open economies\n            like Malaysia are vulnerable to boom and bust cycles and\n            therefore need mechanisms to manage them effectively. 9)\n            Economies like Malaysia need to develop a social sector\n            strategy to manage the risks arising from globalization,\n            especially mechanisms to reach the urban poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia - Economic Recovery and Social\n            Sector Loan

of\n            the Government's program of pre-emptive measures to: a)\n            minimize the downturn of economic activity; b) implement\n            policy reforms to resume robust and sustainable growth; c)\n            expand safety nets to protect the hard core and the near\n            poor from the adverse effects of the regional crisis; and d)\n            protect investments in the human resources base. The loan\n            will be disbursed in a single tranche of $300 million upon\n            Board approval and effectiveness. The Government's will\n            implement a series of structural reforms which are focused\n            on four key areas: 1) Maintaining sound macroeconomic policy\n            with flexibility in the light of uncertainties in the\n            economic environment. 2) Strengthening the financial sector\n            in the light of the regional crisis including consolidation\n            of finance companies and pre-emptive recapitalization of\n            viable banking institutions. 3) Improving competitiveness by\n            strengthening corporate governance, enhancing transparency\n            and disclosure of information. 4) Strengthening social\n            safety nets to soften the negative impact of the economic\n            crisis on the lower income and vulnerable groups. A key risk\n            to the program is if the downturn in economic activity turns\n            out to be greater than currently expected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia - Economic Recovery and
