Some lessons\n            learned included: (1) Coordination is a challenge. The\n            project's success owed much to the strong role played\n            by Ceara Economic Research Institute (IPECE) in conducting\n            monthly project meetings and following up as problems arose.\n            Nevertheless, fifteen partners pushed the limits of what\n            could be managed effectively. (2) Beware the use of outcome\n            indicators that may readily escape government control. (3)\n            Secondary indicators proved to be a useful innovation of the\n            project to retain a focus on an important outcome metric\n            when attribution fidelity was lacking. (4) Coordination\n            between distinct levels of government can be particularly\n            fraught. This problem underscores the importance of\n            restricting indicators, so far as possible, to\n            actions/activities substantially controlled by the client.\n            (5) Extraordinary efforts are warranted during project\n            design to reduce information asymmetries. (6) How much\n            flexibility is too much? Some flexibility is warranted for\n            the World Bank to approve modifications or extensions to\n            meet performance targets. However, a high degree of\n            flexibility risks undermining the performance incentives of\n            the targets. The Bank should consider stipulating in the\n            project documentation that major accommodations must be\n            justified by factors fully beyond Government of Ceara control."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Ceara Second Sector Wide Approach\n            (SWAP) Inclusive Growth Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Ceara Second Sector Wide\n

The potential\n            safeguard impacts associated with this project are linked to\n            hospital certification (hospital waste disposal) and\n            investments in WSS connections. No potential large scale,\n            significant and/or irreversible impacts are anticipated\n            owing to the activities of the project. The works related to\n            water and sanitation will be localized and site-specific.\n            Some specific investments for WSS may result in\n            site-specific, reversible impacts that will be mitigated.\n            Involuntary resettlements, if any, associated with these\n            programs will be localized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Marco referencial para reassentamentos involuntarios"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Ceara Second Sector Wide\n            Approach (SWAP) Inclusive Growth Project : resettlement plan\n            : Marco referencial para reassentamentos involuntarios"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/03/9123520/brazil-ceara-second-sector-wide-approach-swap-inclusive-growth-project-resettlement-plan-marco-referencial-para-reassentamentos-involuntarios","projn":"BR-Ceara Inclusive Growth (Swap II) -- P106765","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Housing & Human Habitats,Population Policies,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20080324134303"},"theme":"Education for the knowledge economy,Regulation and competition policy,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Managing for development results,Environmental policies and institutions","subsc":"General education sector,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General public administration sector,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Portuguese","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic infrastructure, basic sanitation,\n            Borrower, communities, cost recovery, Description,\n            development objectives, Disclosure of Information,\n            Disclosure Requirements, drought, droughts, Emergencies,\n            Environmental, environmental impact, environmental\n            management, Environmental policies, environmental risk,\n            expenditures, families, financial management, General\n            public, Habitats, hospital, ID, Indigenous Peoples,\n            Information Disclosure, infrastructure investments,\n            interventions, investment programs, literacy, Loan, loan\n            amount, modernization, policy framework, progress, Public\n            expenditure, receipt, Resettlement, resources management,\n            responsibilities, risk management, Safety, sanitation,\n            service provision, service quality, Social Development,\n            stakeholders, urban infrastructure, Urbanization, waste\n            disposal, Waste Management, water resources"}},"owner":"Finance & Private Sector (LCSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"RP651"},"facets":{}}}
