The policy development component was\n            successful, the institutional strengthening component was\n            partially successful, and the physical targets were achieved\n            if not exceeded. These are among the lessons learned: Direct\n            public sector investment in land development and housing\n            finance is problematic in spite of mitigating measures such\n            as technical assistance introduced into project design and\n            conditionality. Formulation, adoption, and\n            operationalization of new policies takes much longer than\n            usually assumed by government and the Bank at appraisal\n            although political will and determination on the part of\n            government agencies eventually lead to success.\n            Institutional strengthening programs also need more time,\n            and sustained improvements in the performance of\n            institutions take considerably longer than the average\n            project implementation period. Bilateral assistance to\n            finance technical assistance is preferred because it is\n            usually on a grant basis to the government, and can be\n            passed on, on the same terms. Strong management commitment\n            to the project's objectives can bring about a reversal\n            in poor implementation trends when it is brought to their\n            attention that the project's target group is being\n            missed. Good coordination and communications among\n            cofinanciers can lend credence to policy advice, resulting\n            in improved implementation and greater overall impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Fiji - Housing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Fiji - Housing
