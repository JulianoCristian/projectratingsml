Some lessons learned included: flexibility\n            should be built into the project design. The task team and\n            International Development Association (IDA) management\n            remained flexible throughout project implementation,\n            adjusting the project scope, individual project components,\n            project schedule, and closing dates as needed to take into\n            account the energy sector restructuring and reforms.\n            Although the outcomes of these reforms and restructuring\n            were highly desirable, they did have a negative impact on\n            the pace of project implementation. In order to include\n            'local cost sharing', and to reduce the cost, the\n            contracts were split so that part of the civil works was\n            financed by High Voltage Electric Network CJSC (transmission\n            company) (HVEN) and awarded to local contractors. Some\n            delays could have been reduced by including all civil works\n            under the supply and installation contracts, which suppliers\n            can then sub-contract to local
