Some lessons learned includes: reforms\n            cannot exceed the pace of capacity improvements. A suitable\n            and country-specific time frame needs to be factored in the\n            preparation for and the implementation of\n            institutional-building activities and technical assistance\n            components. Basics should be considered a priority before\n            more sophisticated reforms are attempted. If basic take\n            longer than envisaged then the introduction of the\n            sophisticated reforms should be delayed. Large procurement\n            packages are no substitute for adequate staffing of key\n            government institutions to undertake large-scale reforms.\n            Large-scale contracts for consultancy services are difficult\n            to manage and require more absorptive capacity from the\n            client agencies. Continual efforts are needed to consolidate\n            gains, to advance reforms and ensure that the benefits from\n            the reforms are released. Flexibility in design and adaption\n            during implementation are crucial. So that support can be\n            client and problem driven project teams must be in a\n            position to adapt during implementation and respond to\n            changing
