Both the Bank and the Borrower\u0092s performances were\n            rated moderately satisfactory. The project was restructured\n            on April 2, 2012 to refine the results framework, some\n            indicators to allow more rigorous and timely monitoring of\n            the project, and baselines. It was restructured again\n            December 16, 2013, to extend the grant closing date by 5\n            months. Additionally, one new PDO indicator was added\n            (Growth Monitoring and Promotion GMP sessions) with the\n            existing iodized salt indicator removed. As for the\n            intermediary indicators, two new indicators were included\n            (health personnel receiving training in CBN and masters\n            level training in nutrition) and others were refined in\n            their specificity. There were several lessons learned from\n            this project including the following: (1) strong country\n            ownership and integration of interventions into an existing\n            and wider multi sectoral agenda on nutrition and\n            multi-partner investment strategy was key to the success of\n            the project, (2) the existence of an existing\n            institutionalized community level service delivery model,\n            quite unique to Ethiopia, was instrumental to the success of\n            the project at the community level, and (3) multi-sectoral\n            coordination on nutrition is difficult, yet critical to the\n            achievement of the wider nutrition agenda of countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Nutrition
