Lessons address five broad categories: 1)\n            Project experience demonstrated that although\n            nongovernmental organizations, and associations do hold an\n            intimate knowledge of local communities, and in dealing with\n            beneficiaries, they have limited technical, financial\n            management, and monitoring and evaluation capacities. Thus,\n            competitive processes to award contracts should be promoted,\n            performance indicators strengthened, and monitoring criteria\n            adapted. 2) The community driven approach, and pace should\n            be adapted to the local socio-cultural context, focused on\n            care, and treatment of HIV/AIDS. 3) Behavioral change is\n            more likely to occur if preventive messages are accompanied\n            by genuine changes in gender dynamics, i.e., changes that\n            empower women to better control their sexuality, while\n            multi-sectoral common goals should transcend institutional\n            boundaries. 4) Performance indicators should be selected to\n            achieve program goals, and objectives, within realistic\n            targets, by assessing institutional arrangements capable of\n            handling monitoring and evaluation. 5) Flexible procedures\n            should be adopted for channeling funds, to improve\n            accountability, raise motivation, and accelerate the pace of implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Population and AIDS Control

To this end, the project will support policies and\n            investments designed to support the implementation of the\n            Government's population policy by improving quality of,\n            and access to, family planning (FP) and maternal and child\n            health care services nationwide; promoting information,\n            education, and communication programs in the areas of\n            population, FP and women's rights; and strengthening\n            institutions in charge of implementing the national\n            population policy and of planning, managing and evaluating\n            FP programs. The project will also strengthen the national\n            capacity to contain the spread of HIV, Acquired\n            Immune-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), STDs by strengthening the\n

fertility decline by increasing the prevalence of modern\n            methods of contraception; and b) slow the spread of Human\n            Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections by promoting\n            behavioral change and treating Sexually Transmitted Diseases\n            (STDs). To this end, the project will support policies and\n            investments designed to support the implementation of the\n            Government's population policy by improving quality of,\n            and access to, family planning (FP) and maternal and child\n            health care services nationwide; promoting information,\n            education, and communication programs in the areas of\n            population, FP and women's rights; and strengthening\n            institutions in charge of implementing the national\n            population policy and of planning, managing and evaluating\n            FP programs. The project will also strengthen the national\n            capacity to contain the spread of HIV, Acquired\n            Immune-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), STDs by strengthening the\n            institution in charge of implementing the national AIDS\n            program and the health system's capacity to deal with\n            AIDS needs; promoting safer health practices and behavioral\n            change through information, education, and communications\n            campaigns; promoting the use of condoms; treating STDs; and\n            strengthening clinical management and community care.\n            Finally, the project will encourage private sector and\n            non-governmental organizations participation in population,\n            FP and HIV/AIDS/STD programs by establishing a fund to\n            provide grant financing for projects in those areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Population and AIDS Control
