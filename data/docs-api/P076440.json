Some lessons\n            learned includes: rural energy projects should adopt simple\n            easy to monitor indicators for project implementation, and\n            to complement this monitoring by a more comprehensive impact\n            evaluation near the end of the project life. High engagement\n            of local private sector in rural electrification schemes\n            concessions and low appetite from international private\n            sector in large concessions. These concessions had been\n            planned through a top down approach. Two such concessions\n            had started prior to the project. The majority of energy\n            service companies (ESCOs) have implemented business models\n            based on isolated solar home systems (SHS) and conventional\n            diesel fueled micro-grids with installed generation\n            capacities mainly below 20kW. Partnerships with the local\n            banking sector need to be strengthened to stimulate income\n            generating activities following electrification. Active and\n            sustained participation of community leaders are needed for\n            successful community-based wood fuel management initiatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Additional
