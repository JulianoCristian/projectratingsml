Some lessons learned includes:\n            outcomes and indicators that measure those outcomes should\n            be closely linked to prior actions and triggers. Whereas\n            policy reforms are expected to eventually result in changes\n            at the farm level, prior actions and triggers only cause\n            change at an intermediate level, which must be seen as\n            necessary steps towards achieving the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). Sector-specific DPOs have a technical\n            ministry as the main counterpart and client for policy\n            development, and the Ministry of finance and economic\n            planning as the contractual partner and client to whom the\n            resources are disbursed. The AgDPO series successfully\n            integrated a number of policy issues that are relevant to\n            the implementation of a number of Bank-financed investment\n            lending operations. An important lesson for future\n            operations is to ensure that the policy agenda underlying\n            the operation is complementary to the Bank's and other\n            development partners' investment lending operations,\n            thus creating synergies that enhance the policy making\n            process as well as program implementation. The design of\n            AgDPO policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are\n            major undertakings that need to be better integrated in\n            Ministry of Food and

Agriculture\n            Development Policy Operation Program (AgDPO 3) is to enhance\n            the productivity and competitiveness of Ghanaian\n            agriculture. Ghana's agricultural sector is on a growth\n            path and opportunities exist for significant further\n            development. Structural transformation of Ghana's\n            economy is ongoing. The contribution of the country's\n            services sector to the economy has overtaken that of the\n            agricultural sector, the latter now no longer in first\n            place. Poverty levels are falling, and Ghana as a nation is\n            largely food secure. The AgDPO 3 is a single tranche credit\n            for US$57 million equivalent and the first Development\n            Policy Operation (DPO) in a new series intended to help the\n            Government of Ghana (GoG) implement the Medium Term\n            Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP). The operation\n            supports the development objectives set in the Ghana Shared\n            Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) for 2010-2013. The\n            GSGDA emphasizes the need for greater executive efficiency,\n            transparency and accountability to provide the adequate\n            setting for the reduction of poverty and socio-economic\n            inequalities through agricultural, private sector,\n            infrastructure and human resource development. The operation\n            supports the Government's efforts to address the\n            development needs of the northern part of the country. To\n            address the growing regional discrepancy between the North\n            and the South, the Government's agriculture programs\n            feature a strong focus on the North, evidenced by the\n            Savanna Accelerated Development Agency's (SADA) program\n            that facilitates commercial agriculture development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Third Agriculture Development
