Some lessons learned included:\n            in a multi-donor program with parallel financing,\n            coordination among funding partners is critical to timely\n            delivery of outputs. Donor coordination may involve: (i)\n            harmonization of procedures; and (ii) sharing of information\n            in a systematic way during implementation. Full\n            harmonization is unlikely when each donor is required to\n            follow a separate set of rules when it comes to funding and\n            component management. It is incumbent upon the project team\n            to harmonize rules & procedures during the project\n            preparation phase and to adopt an acceptable set of\n            consistent procedures that will facilitate implementation,\n            funds availability, and monitoring and evaluation. In\n            operation involving a great number of executing agencies,\n            donors, and activities, the importance of having a strong\n            Implementing Agency assembled at the inception of the\n            operation with the required equipment and expertise cannot\n            be overstated. Economic Management Capacity Project (EMCAP)\n            involved a number of executing agencies involved, funding\n            sources, components and activities. During the first two\n            years, the Project Unit (PU) lacked the necessary equipment\n            and skills to perform efficiently. Train the trainers could\n            be an effective way to initiate a process to sustain\n            capacity building efforts. Because of the higher turnover\n            rate experienced in some of the Project Executing Agencies\n            (PEAs), there were constant needs to train new people. At\n            the National assembly, for instance, more than fifty percent\n            of the members who benefited from EMCAP training sessions\n            were not reelected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Economic Management Capacity\n            Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Economic Management\n            Capacity Building

The project supports and strengthens capacity\n            building efforts and assists in good governance and the\n            anti-corruption stance of the government.

The third component supports\n            oversight institutions to promote transparency and\n            accountability in the public sector, and to improve\n            dissemination of information on fiscal operations. The\n            fourth component finances a comprehensive review of the\n            public sector covering financial, operational, technical,\n            legal, and contractual aspects as well as reform of key\n            sector institutions.
