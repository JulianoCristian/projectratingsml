Lessons\n            learned from the project are as follows: Early involvement\n            of key stakeholders in project preparation, specifically\n            including local communities and influential decision makers,\n            is essential in order to ensure ownership and successful\n            project implementation. In order to achieve environmental,\n            social, institutional and financial sustainability,\n            conservation strategies, as well as applied research and\n            monitoring programs, must be site-specific and targeted to\n            provide direct support for effective conservation\n            management, addressing local issues and needs. Where\n            consumptive use of natural resources is an issue (e.g.,\n            logging, grazing, hunting, fishing, etc.), resource users\n            must be substantively involved in the design of sustainable\n            resource management systems, and effective monitoring and\n            control mechanisms need to be developed and applied. Small\n            grants programs targeted at local communities within and\n            near Protected Areas can be a very effective tool for\n            leveraging community efforts in the direction of\n            nondestructive livelihoods and building local capacity to\n            attract additional funds from various national and\n            international sources in support of these activities.\n            Existence of a well developed and stable anchor organization\n            is a key prerequisite for successful replication and\n            up-scaling of project results. Where such strong management\n            organizations exist, their technical capacity should be\n            carefully preserved and fully utilized. A critical enabling\n            factor for strong performance of project teams is the\n            ability of site managers to create and maintain strong\n            teams, based on a transparent and highly competitive staff\n            selection process. Using a PIU for project coordination can\n            be a strong project asset if run as a business, if the PIU\n            is lean and focused on a few management tasks, with\n            day-to-day decisions done without unnecessary bureaucratic\n            red tape."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Biodiversity Conservation\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Biodiversity\n            Conservation Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6944389/romania-biodiversity-conservation-management-project","projn":"RO-Biodiversity Conservation Management\n            Project -- P044176","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Ecosystems and Natural Habitats,Wildlife Resources,Forestry,Tourism and Ecotourism","teratopic":"Rural Development,Environment","count":"Romania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060724152831"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Other domestic and international trade,Forestry","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plans, adjacent areas, Agriculture,\n            animal, animals, BIODIVERSITY, BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION,\n            biodiversity conservation activities, BIODIVERSITY\n            CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT, Biodiversity Convention,\n            Biodiversity Information, biodiversity management,\n            biodiversity monitoring, biodiversity resources, biological\n            diversity, Birds, bison, breeding, community outreach,\n            conservation activities, conservation issues, CONSERVATION\n            MANAGEMENT, Conservation of Nature, conservation research,\n            Conservation Value, cultural significance, ecological\n            integrity, ecological surveys, ecosystem, ecosystem\n            functions, ecosystem level, ecosystems, ecotourism\n            activities, Ecotourism strategies, Environmental Law,\n            Environmental policies, Environmental Protection,\n            exploitation, Fauna, field activities, Flora International,\n            Forest, Forest Administration, forest area, forest areas,\n            forest certification, forest ecosystems, forest management,\n            forest management certification, forest management planning,\n            forest management plans, forest products, Forest Research,\n            Forest Stewardship, Forestry, Forests, genetic, Geographic\n            Information, Geographic Information System, GIS, grasslands,\n            grazing impacts, Habitats, independent certification,\n            issues, land acquisition, land owners, land restitution,\n            land-use, land-use planning, landscapes, legal mandate,\n            livestock, local communities, management systems, mountains,\n            national biodiversity, National Biodiversity Strategy,\n            National Forest, National Park, national parks, natural\n            ecosystems, Natural Park, Natural Parks, nature protection,\n            park area, Park Management, Park staff, pastures, private\n            land, Protected Areas, public awareness, public awareness\n            activities, received certification, sensitive zones,\n            species, state forests, status of biodiversity,\n            Sustainability, Sustainable Development, sustainable forest\n            management, sustainable management, sustainable natural\n            resource, sustainable natural resource use, threats to\n            biodiversity, Tourist, tourist information, tourists,\n            uncertainty, variety, visitor, visitors, wildlife, wildlife conservation"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF022499-GEF2; ROMANIA BIODIVERSITY,TF028358-GEF1-EPPG ROMANIA INTEGRATED\n            PROTECTED AREAS & CONSERV.
