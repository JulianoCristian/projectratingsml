Lessons learned from the\n            project: the establishment of an HIV/AIDS coordinating\n            institution, with significant decentralization within a\n            country, is a major undertaking. Financial allocations and\n            disbursements are necessary but insufficient conditions for\n            successful NGO participation in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n            There is a need to increase funding for community level\n            activities substantially to meet the demands created through\n            community mobilization. Adequate emphasis needs to be given\n            to expansion of prevention and care and support services,\n            particularly in rural areas. Failure to establish key\n            baseline data and to design and install a monitoring and\n            evaluation system was a missed opportunity for creating a\n            targeted, results-based approach. The role of HAPCO in the\n            multi-sectoral response is crucial and needs to be\n            strengthened. The capacity building for government agencies\n            and civil society has been substantial and generally\n            successful. The support for public sector entities has\n            resulted in some remarkable successes that go beyond basic\n            workplace interventions and the creation of awareness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Multisectoral HIV/AIDS

The project is\n            the first phase of the regional Program, covering Ethiopia,\n            and Kenya, who have met the eligibility criteria for\n            accessing funds under the MAP, developed comprehensive\n            multi-sectoral strategic plans for the medium term, and\n            endorsed the principle of public/private partnerships, to\n            implement their national strategies, and assume overall\n            program coordination.

The Kenya program will\n            intensify the fight against AIDS, supporting five priority\n            areas, that include prevention, and advocacy, treatment and\n            support of the
