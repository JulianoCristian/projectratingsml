Some lessons\n            learned included: Even if all prior actions are met,\n            especially in the case of one-tranche operations where all\n            such actions are met before Board presentation, the number\n            and share of people living in poverty is not reduced. This\n            leads to three conclusions. First, welfare changes poor have\n            be analyzed, as there might be impacts not necessarily\n            reflected in a reduction in the poverty rate. Second, policy\n            measures supported by poverty reduction support credit\n            (PRSC) may take a longer time to reduce the number of poor\n            people than ex-post evaluations may not reveal. There should\n            be a better understanding of the timing and mechanisms\n            through which these policies affect the poor. In some cases,\n            these policies lay the ground for growth to affect poverty,\n            although by themselves they may not have a direct and\n            immediate effect on the poverty rate. Lastly, policy actions\n            may not have been relevant to reduce poverty. Since it is\n            Bank policy to support Government-designed poverty reduction\n            strategy paper (PRSP), the analysis of these should be\n            reinforced to highlight those policies that, in the\n            Bank's view, will have a higher probability of\n            impacting poverty rates. Close and real coordination with\n            other development assistance partners is essential to the\n            success and continuity of policy-based lending, as it\n            provides the necessary financial and political leverage.\n            Single tranche operations, wherein all prior actions are\n            accomplished before Board presentation, have less\n            operational difficulties and provide the right incentives to\n            the borrower, by rewarding for self-determined and\n            self-decided actions, rather than buying policy reforms that\n            can always be reversed subsequently. Ideally, these should\n            be yearly operations. From the borrower's perspective,\n            this also allows closer coordination with the national\n            budget cycle and more predictability of financial\n            assistance. Accordingly, the amount of the operation needs\n            to be commensurate with its one-tranche design, as well as\n            the timing of intended development objectives. For this to\n            be possible, the Bank needs to assign sufficient\n            administrative resources for project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Poverty Reduction Support
