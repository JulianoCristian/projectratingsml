adjustment program which aims\n            at increasing the efficiency of resource use in the Nigerien\n            economy and strengthening the country's resource base\n            for future economic development, as well as improving the\n            public finance position and the balance of payments. The\n            first phase of the program focuses on areas in which\n            inefficiencies are most acute and where policy improvements\n            will have the greatest beneficial impact on the\n            country's budgetary and balance of payments position:\n            (1) public resource management; (2) the parastatal sector;\n            and (3) agricultural policy. The preparation of specific\n            reform measures in other sectors is also an integral part of\n            the first phase of the Government's program. To this\n            end the Government is undertaking studies to identify and\n            prepare reform measures for energy, forestry, livestock,\n            financial sector, industry and trade to be implemented in\n            subsequent phases of the adjustment program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Structural Adjustment Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger -
