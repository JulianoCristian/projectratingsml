Some lessons learned included:\n            the Bank project team should have taken a harder line and\n            tried to overhaul the project at some point. This can have\n            included downgrading the project when product disbursement\n            was below projections, restructuring the project to have a\n            narrower focus, and refusing to provide a no objection to\n            extending the contracts of non-performing Transition Support\n            Unit (TSU) staff. The eight Project Development Objective\n            (PDO) indicators should have been overhauled at the time of\n            the first restructuring to more properly reflect the PDOs.\n            In future statistics projects, a close connection between\n            indicators and objectives should be insured at the time of\n            project design. Closer attention should be given to\n            measuring relevant results. This applies to both information\n            used to inform the PDO indicators and to information that\n            will enable the project team to better understand project\n            performance. Data that is collected with public funds should\n            be freely available to the public. A set of activities can\n            be identified in the project design phase, and the project\n            can focus on ensuring that those particular activities take\n            place. This less ambitious approach will have a greater\n            chance of achieving its objectives, and the Bank can be\n            confident that its funds are well-spent. Focusing the\n            lending instrument on results will closely tie the money to\n            what it is intended to the objectives, presumably increasing\n            the likelihood of success, and also reducing the burden of\n            supervision for the project team."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Development of the National\n            Statistical System

objective of the\n            Development of the National Statistical System Project for\n            Kenya is to establish a sustainable national statistical\n            system to provide reliable, timely and accurate data in\n            accordance with international standards through:  (a)\n            strengthening the capacity of the relevant statistical\n            agencies through training and adoption of new information\n            and communication technology; (b) carrying out legal and\n            institutional reforms that promote statistical data\n            development; (c) establishing linkages among statistical\n            data producers; (d) promoting statistical information\n            sharing among data users to strengthen the quality of\n            decision making; and (e) developing a data access and\n            dissemination strategy in conformity with relevant\n            legislation and international good practice. The\n            restructuring consists of (i) a reallocation of SDR 1.10m\n            (USD 1.6m) from the spending category consultant services\n            and audits to training and workshops, and (ii) an extension\n            of the closing date from June 30, 2012 to September 30,\n            2012, as requested by Government of Kenya in its letter\n            dated the June 22, 2012. This is the second extension of the\n            closing date after the project was restructured the first\n            time in December 2010. The total cumulative extension does\n            not exceed two years, and therefore does not require RVP\n            approval. The restructuring will facilitate completion of\n            two ongoing priority activities: 1) finalizing the ongoing\n            installation of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\n            system in Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), which\n            includes automating all financial, administrative and HR\n            systems. The ERP is expected to improve some of the\n            weaknesses identified in the recent procurement and\n            financial management reviews; 2) completing the third phase\n            of the master sampling frame National Sample Survey and\n            Evaluation Program (NASSEP) in the arid and semi-arid parts\n            of Kenya. The NASSEP will form the basis for all national\n            household-based surveys in Kenya until the next census in\n            2019.

In particular, there has been appreciable progress\n            in data production, institutional reform, capacity and\n            infrastructure development, and in coordination of the\n            national statistical system.

However, access to data and\n            dissemination had performed below expectations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Development of the\n            National Statistical System Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16461771/kenya-development-national-statistical-system-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"KE-Development Of The National Statistical\n            System Project -- P085414","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120703044354"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Managing for development results,Economic statistics, modeling and forecasting","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, Amount due, Audit Office,\n            borrower, budget allocations, communication technology, CPI,\n            data access, disbursement, disbursements, electronic format,\n            Enterprise Resource Planning, extension, financial\n            management, Financial Reports, Financing Plan, hard copy,\n            ID, Implementation Plan, implementing agencies, Implementing\n            Agency, information sharing, infrastructure development,\n            installation, institutional reform, institutional reforms,\n            international standards, procurement, procurement plan,\n            production time, results, targets, user, users, violence"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 2 (AFTP2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Economic management","repnb":"70750"},"15487068":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/11/15487068/kenya-development-national-statistical-system-project-p085414-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-08","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/11/15487068/kenya-development-national-statistical-system-project-p085414-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-08","new_url":"2011/11/15487068/kenya-development-national-statistical-system-project-p085414-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-08","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-11-20T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-11-20T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b0810b1633","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0810b1633","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2011/11/20/05741B441A327A8B8525794E004AB577/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P0854140ISR0Di020201101321796161011.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2011/11/20/05741B441A327A8B8525794E004AB577/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0854140ISR0Di020201101321796161011.pdf","credit_no":"IDAQ4281;IDAQ4280;IDA42760","datestored":"2011-11-20T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-11-20T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -
