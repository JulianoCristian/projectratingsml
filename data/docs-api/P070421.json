Ratings for the\n            Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project for India were\n            as follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: the\n            physical and financial sustainability of a road network\n            hinges on the road agency's capacity to undertake\n            needs-based and timely implementation of road improvement\n            and maintenance works. This enables optimal use of available\n            funds, and avoids greater costs of repair in the future.\n            Beyond project completion, Gujarat has worked to consolidate\n            its capacity for and progress in monitoring road condition\n            data and prioritizing road works on that basis.\n            Institutional and administrative capacity-building should be\n            carried out in step with the readiness of the target agency\n            to internalize it. The ability to improve capacity on\n            multiple fronts such as planning, procurement, contract\n            management, and environmental and social safeguards may\n            differ from one road agency to another, and may take more\n            than one project cycle to materialize. As road agencies\n            evolve from being providers of roads services to managers of\n            increasingly outsourced functions, it is essential that core\n            competencies are retained and strengthened to ensure\n            sustainable management of the road network. The core\n            competencies relating to planning, technical design, road\n            management systems, procurement, contract management and\n            environmental and social safeguards have been impacted to\n            different extents in Gujarat and Karnataka due to\n            outsourcing to consulting firms, staff turnover, staff\n            depletion and lack of follow-up training. The roads agency\n            should lead the way in creating a productive working\n            relationship with other entities involved in the\n            implementation of roads projects. A culture of partnership\n            and cooperation was demonstrated in Gujarat between the\n            roads and buildings department, road works contractors and\n            supervising engineers which minimized disputes and speeded\n            up implementation. A knowledge product that seeks to cover a\n            subject that has already been well studied must provide\n            clear justification of its likely added value."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Some lessons\n            learned included: Decentralization of task leadership and\n            supervision of the project to the Bank country office\n            enables continuous project monitoring and timely addressing\n            of emerging implementation issues. Due to decentralized task\n            leadership and supervision of KSHIP, the Bank team was able\n            to provide continuous and rigorous monitoring of project\n            implementation and conduct frequent site visits. As a\n            result, many critical issues received timely and adequate\n            attention from the Bank side. Institutional and policy\n            reforms should be implemented incrementally and\n            sequentially. Implementation of reforms takes a lot of time,\n            because it takes time to get political consensus, build\n            ownership, change the mindset, and re-design some of the\n            reforms to adjust to new circumstances. Some of the reforms\n            (i.e., establishment of Road Fund (RF), moving from a\n            traditional works executing agency to a corporatized roads\n            managing agency) planned in KSHIP eventually spill over to a\n            follow-on project. When the project plans to have major,\n            sophisticated policy and institutional interventions, it\n            should take an incremental approach to - sector reforms,\n            with phased actions to modernize and strengthen a minimum\n            set of core management functions within the existing\n            context. Post-qualification allows more competition than\n            pre-qualification. The experience in procurement of works\n            contracts showed that post qualification is likely to get a\n            more competitive price."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Karnataka State
