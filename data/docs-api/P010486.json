A\n            \"likely\" rating was given for the overall project,\n            despite weak performance in several components, too because\n            of the heavy weight accorded to the access and quality\n            components. Both World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            rated marginally satisfactory.

Desired capacities, numbers of individuals who\n            would develop those capacities and desired outcomes or\n            indicators of progress should have been identified and\n            agreed to at the outset of the project.

The technical/advisory teams would\n            have strengthened their impact by integrating themselves\n            better programmatically, physically, and\n            socially/psychologically into the on-going activities of the\n            education department.
