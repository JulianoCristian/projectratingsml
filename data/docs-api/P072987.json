The various studies and surveys partly\n            or fully financed by the project had a great impact on\n            strategy discussions later in implementation and in\n            particular on the design of the repeater project. In\n            particular, investment in second-generation surveillance\n            surveys of high-risk groups, starting in 2003, provided\n            badly needed data to reduce uncertainty and shape the\n            response. Achieving a multisectoral response is very\n            challenging and requires attention to the interests,\n            capacities, and incentives of the relevant stakeholders. A\n            focused approach, as adopted by the repeater project, and\n            allowing greater control of resources by sector ministries\n            and other actors, is called for. Similarly, encouraging\n            coordination at the local level, particularly with health\n            and education services, requires consideration of interests\n            and incentives. Generally, an effective balance between a\n            decentralized bottom-up approach and a more centralized\n            top-down strategy is difficult to achieve. The former is\n            necessary to ensure community participation, relevance, and\n            ownership of interventions, while the latter is required for\n            technical quality and coherence with the necessary strategy\n            to address the particular epidemiological situation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Multisectoral STI/HIV/AIDS\n            Prevention

The\n            project has four components. The first finances the\n            devleopment of sector strategies and operational plans for\n            eight key sectors: education; health; information, culture\n            and communication; labor; population; rural development; and\n            security. The component finances workshops, focus group\n            discussions, pilot projects, and provdes an unallocated\n            amount to finance scaling up activities in the sector action\n            plans. The second component creates a mechanism--a Fund--to\n            provide financial incentives to correct market\n            inefficiencies in the demand for, and provision, of\n            prevention activities. Specifically, the Fund finances peer\n            group discussions, counseling, social marketing of condoms\n            and STI kits, operational costs, and strengthening the\n            capacity of implementing entities. The third component\n            monitors project progress, evaluates the impact of project\n            activities, and supports thes studies undertaken in\n            component 1. The fourth component finances the project\n            implementation unit's (UGP) personnel, equipment,\n            operational costs, and periodic technical
