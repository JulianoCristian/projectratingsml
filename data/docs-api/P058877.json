The institutional\n            development impact for the Emergency Earthquake Recovery\n            Project is substantial, while the other two projects\n            received ratings of modest for this aspect. Lessons for\n            disaster recovery suggested by the experience of these\n            projects included: 1) The support the Bank promptly provided\n            enabled people to survive, put funds into the economy, and\n            was reported as highly preferable to in-kind support by\n            beneficiaries. 2)  Greater accuracy of damage assessments is\n            still needed to avoid unnecessary construction. 3)\n            Addressing the social and economic recovery aspects of\n            emergency projects, although difficult, is critical for the\n            sustainability of the reconstruction investments. 4)\n            Creating New Disaster Management Institutions takes more\n            time than is available under one project. 5) Cash Transfer\n            projects can make an extremely important contribution to\n            recovery. Getting cash support to victims quickly positively\n            affected the economy and perhaps even affected people's\n            sense of safety and security. It was a prominent first sign\n            of the government's support in a time of acute need."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Erzincan Earthquake Rehabilitation\n            and Reconstruction Project, Turkey Emergency Flood and\n            Earthquake Recovery Project, and Emergency Earthquake\n            Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Erzincan Earthquake\n            Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, Turkey Emergency\n            Flood and Earthquake Recovery Project, and Emergency\n            Earthquake Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6067987/turkey-erzincan-earthquake-rehabilitation-reconstruction-project-turkey-emergency-flood-earthquake-recovery-project-emergency-earthquake-recovery-project","projn":"TR-Emergency Earthquake Recovery Loan (Eerl)\n            -- P068394,TR-Earthquake Rehabilitation &\n            Reconstruction Project -- P009099,TR-Emergency Flood & Earthquake Recovery\n            Project -- P058877","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050715144818"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage,Housing construction,General public administration sector,Roads and highways,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General industry and trade sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actions, apartments, Bank management, Bank\n            Performance, beneficiaries, casualties, cities, collapsed\n            buildings, construction industry, cooperative housing, cost\n            of capital, crime, damage assessment, development\n            objectives, disaster assistance, disaster emergencies,\n            Disaster Insurance, Disaster Management, disaster\n            preparedness, disaster recovery, Disaster Rehabilitation,\n            Disasters, displaced persons, dwellings, Earthquake\n            Reconstruction, earthquakes, EIB, Emergencies, Emergency\n            Management, Emergency Recovery, Emergency Recovery Loan,\n            engineers, Epidemiology, fatalities, Fiscal Year,\n            flexibility, flood control, flood protection, flooding,\n            floods, hospitals, houses, Housing, Housing Development,\n            housing units, human settlements, injuries, Institutional\n            Development, Insurance, insurance industry, Landslides,\n            living conditions, municipalities, Natural Disasters,\n            natural hazards, natural resources, neighborhoods, nurses,\n            Operations, peer review, Private housing, project cycle,\n            Project Implementation, public buildings, quality at entry,\n            rates, rural areas, safety, Savings, schools, Settlement,\n            shelter, Social Issues, stakeholders, supervision,\n            supervision costs, Sustainability, technical assistance,\n            urban housing, vandalism, victims, water supply"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE),Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022839-GERMAN JPO-MR.

The lessons learned indicate that\n            methodologies are needed for addressing the problem of\n            reconciling damage and needs assessments after a disaster,\n            and tailoring project implementation to the refining of the\n            needs estimate, such as by phasing construction and\n            instituting checkpoints for incremental stages during\n            implementation of construction components. A strong,\n            experienced and independent Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) familiar with Bank procedures is especially critical\n            to effective implementation of fast-track emergency\n            projects. Construction supervision by international\n            consultants lent credibility to reconstruction\n            activities-necessary in an environment of distrust of local\n            code enforcement and construction quality. Activities that\n            do not perform well in the early stages of the project, may\n            perform very well later on, as demonstrated by the\n            successful implementation of weather forecasting system. In\n            order to guarantee the sustainability of the apartment\n            blocks and its environment including the landscaping\n            arrangements, site and block management organizations should\n            be established. Specification and monitoring of the\n            interfaces between different contractors and systems is\n            essential. The maximum momentum in an emergency project is\n            normally in the first few months after the disaster. The\n            design of residential sites under emergency construction\n            should recognize that the sites will become permanent\n            settlements and allow for the long-term needs of\n            beneficiaries in the broadest sense, and allow for the\n            higher costs of such an approach. The Bank needs to develop\n            appropriate, operationally-oriented protocols, procedures\n            and design criteria for responding to situations demanding\n            large emergency construction programs, that can be applied\n            soon after a disaster to ensure that design meets the needs\n            of long-term urban development, as well as the short-term\n            emergency needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Emergency Flood and Earthquake\n            Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Emergency Flood and\n            Earthquake Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/02/3324858/turkey-emergency-flood-earthquake-recovery-project","projn":"TR-Emergency Flood & Earthquake Recovery\n            Project -- P058877","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Municipal Housing and Land,Non Bank Financial Institutions,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040503104240"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Roads and highways,Irrigation and drainage,Housing construction,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Assurance,Bank Performance,Bank\n            procedures,Bank supervision,bridges,civil service,Compulsory\n            Insurance,construction contracts,construction\n            industry,construction management,disaster\n            insurance,disasters,earthquake insurance,Economic\n            recovery,employment,families,financial management,FISCAL\n            YEAR,hospitals,houses,Housing,Housing construction,Housing\n            Development,housing units,inflation,Institutional\n            Development,Insurance,insurance industry,Insurance\n            Law,interest rates,legislation,living\n            conditions,mandates,municipal infrastructure,municipal\n            services,municipalities,Operating costs,pricing\n            models,private insurance companies,private sector,private\n            sector participation,Public Works,quality control,Real\n            Estate,reinsurance,risk factors,risk management,risk\n            mitigation,Roads,safety,savings,schools,tax,tax\n            revenues,technical assistance,underwriting,urban\n            development,Urban Housing,urban\n            infrastructure,victims,waste,water supply,water supply systems"},"1":{"cdata!":"Assurance,Bank Performance,Bank\n            procedures,Bank supervision,bridges,civil service,Compulsory\n            Insurance,construction contracts,construction\n            industry,construction management,disaster\n            insurance,disasters,earthquake insurance,Economic\n            recovery,employment,families,financial management,FISCAL\n            YEAR,hospitals,houses,Housing,Housing construction,Housing\n            Development,housing units,inflation,Institutional\n            Development,Insurance,insurance industry,Insurance\n            Law,interest rates,legislation,living\n            conditions,mandates,municipal infrastructure,municipal\n            services,municipalities,Operating costs,pricing\n            models,private insurance companies,private sector,private\n            sector participation,Public Works,quality control,Real\n            Estate,reinsurance,risk factors,risk management,risk\n            mitigation,Roads,safety,savings,schools,tax,tax\n            revenues,technical assistance,underwriting,urban\n            development,Urban Housing,urban\n            infrastructure,victims,waste,water supply,water supply systems"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022839-GERMAN JPO-MR.
