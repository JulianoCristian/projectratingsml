The local\n            concessionaires, the Manila Water Company Inc. (MWCI) and\n            Maynilad Water Services Inc. (MWSI) were needed to upgrade\n            their piped water supply and sanitation coverage due to\n            expanding franchise areas. To address the challenge, the\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            set out to promote greater private sector participation to\n            improve the sector. IBRD\u2019s involvement in water concessions\n            was based on the rationale that the private sector can play\n            an important role in delivering services.

Through capital\n            infusion, debt restructuring and infrastructure\n            rehabilitation, both concessionaires managed to accelerate\n            and enhance supply across their franchise areas.

MWCI\u2019s investment program\n            reduced the risk of sicknesses from exposure to sewage\n            contamination, which is estimated to have reduced mortality\n            by 20 percent.

Through capital\n            infusion, debt restructuring and infrastructure\n            rehabilitation, both concessionaires managed to accelerate\n            and enhance supply across their franchise areas. MWCI posted\n            a dramatic increase in 24-hour water supply, to 99 percent\n            in 2009 from 26 percent in 1997. MWCI\u2019s investment program\n            reduced the risk of sicknesses from exposure to sewage\n            contamination, which is estimated to have reduced mortality\n            by 20 percent. IBRD has supported two utilities in expanding\n            affordable and efficient water and sewerage services to\n            benefit some 107,000 poor households."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Potable water improves life for millions in Manila"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Potable water improves life for\n            millions in Manila"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/03/25158115/potable-water-improves-life-millions-manila","count":"Philippines","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"depositors, rural finance, financial\n            services, pdf, liquidation, transparency, results, financial\n            crisis, future, income, development banks, bank, credit,\n            banking system, information, investment projects, portfolio,\n            financial performance, mortgage, mandates, loan, private\n            sector, mergers, market, ownership, rural markets, credit\n            portfolio, development finance institutions, governance\n            structure, international bank, market segments, instruments,\n            governance, private sector investment, technological\n            development, export sector, access to financial services,\n            trade, financial sector assessment, institutions, savings,\n            financial market, investment, housing finance, market\n            development, commercial banks, performance, restructuring,\n            public funds, financial capacity, banking, cooperatives,\n            innovation, institution, development finance, monetary fund,\n            lending, financial institutions, markets, marketing,\n            enterprises, financial sector, target, adjustment loan,\n            rural finance markets, finance, development bank, banking\n            sector, income groups, employees, banks"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Human development,Environment and natural resource management,Public sector governance","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agua potable mejora la vida de millones\n            en Manila"}},"topic":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water Allocation and Water Supply m1326747 1063,Water m1326522 137,Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199","projn":"PH-Lgu Urban Water And Sanitation Project\n            Apl2 -- P069491,PH-Manila Second Sewerage Project -- P004611,PH-Manila Third Sewerage Project -- P079661,PH-Gef-Manila Third Sewerage Project -- P089082","subtopic":"E-Business,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Access to Finance,Emerging Markets","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08314901c_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","theme":"Pollution management and environmental health,Water resource management,Other urban development,Municipal governance and institution building,Pollution management and environmental health,Urban services and housing for the poor,Other human development,Environmental policies and institutions,Other public sector governance,Pollution management and environmental health,Water resource management,Municipal finance,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Other financial and private sector development,Municipal governance and institution building,Other urban development","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA,Global Environment Project","topicv3":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water Allocation and Water Supply m1326747 1063,Water m1326522 137,Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199","owner":"Water -
