high-value, irrigated crops by private,\n            smallholder farmers with simple, low-cost technologies.\n            There are four main project components. The first component\n            has two sub-components: The first concerns participatory\n            research aimed at developing and testing new technologies\n            with farmer participation to increase irrigated production\n            and add value. The second involves advisory services, aimed\n            at ensuring that farmers are provided relevant and effective\n            advice on production and marketing on a regular and timely\n            basis, and aimed at disseminating technologies proved\n            effective in the pilot phase of the project. The second\n            component comprises three elements: The first supports the\n            Nigerien Association for the Promotion of Private Irrigation\n            (ANPIP) in its acquiring increasing autonomy,\n            sustainability, and accountability to its members, and also\n            provides support to producers' organizations. The\n            second subcomponent supports the government's efforts\n            in promoting private irrigation. The third subcomponent is a\n            pilot, testing private management of selected offices for\n            irrigated perimeters (ONAHA) to develop models enabling the\n            government to disengage itself from being directly involved\n            in these schemes. The third component finances an irrigation\n            investment fund and microfinance institutions. The fourth\n            component puts in place an action plan aimed at mitigating\n            environmental risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Private Irrigation Promotion

Promotion Project. Only the\n            usage of agrochemicals constitutes a major negative\n            environmental impact, the impact on the health of farm\n            families causing the principal concern. Other significant\n            environmental issues for small-scale irrigation is the\n            possibility for excessive water extraction from the\n            construction of hand-held pumps, the cultivation of new land\n            parcels (accompanied by deforestation and the soil\n            deterioration), the draw-down of the water table, and the\n            drainage of sediment and runoff and their concomitant effect\n            on water quality. Measures to mitigate these negative\n            impacts include: Developing an environmental assessment of\n            each site and systematically monitoring it ; elaborating and\n            incorporating environmental clauses in all legal documents\n            and contracts relative to this project; putting in place a\n            matching grant system enabling land valuation and\n            environmental preservation; and researching technological\n            options for aquifer use. Finally, an autonomous\n            nongovernmental organization, the Nigerienne Association for\n            Promoting Private Irrigation (ANPIP), will be charged with\n            managing the project's environmental aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Private Irrigation Promotion Project\n            : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger \u2013 Projet de promotion de\n            l\u2019irrigation aupr\u00e8s du secteur priv\u00e9 : \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/09/1637758/niger-private-irrigation-promotion-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"NE-Priv Irrigation Promotion Sil (Fy02) -- P072996","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Niger","authors":{"authr":"Groupe d'Etudeset de Recherche pour le\n            Developpement en Afrique (SARL-GERDA)"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01120704165652"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Agricultural extension and research,Irrigation and drainage","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Aquifers; Hand pumps; Saline waters;\n            Deforestation; Soil acidification; Chemical fertilizers;\n            Agrochemicals; Irrigation systems; Water quality management;\n            Sediment pollution; Pesticide control standards; Pesticide\n            pollution; Water tables; Contract formulation; Land quality\n            indicators; Nongovernmental organizations; Soil erosion;\n            Soil degradation; Land use"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 2 (AFTS2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026717-PHRD-NIGER: PRIVATE IRRIGATION\n            PROMOTION, PHASE II (PIP2)","repnb":"E502"},"facets":{}}}
