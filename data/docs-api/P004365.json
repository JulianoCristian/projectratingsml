World\n            Bank and Borrower performances during the project were\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from these projects\n            are: 1) A country that is heavily reliant on revenues from a\n            small number of oilfields with short production lives cannot\n            afford to let the pace of new exploration slacken. 2) Rents\n            from natural resource extraction are dificult to manage,\n            give rise to complex issues of distribution and equity\n            within societies, are often poorly utilized to finance\n            non-productive activities, and create dependency. The\n            time/breathing space obtained from their extraction is\n            rarely sufficient to diversify the economy. 3) The benefits\n            from improved natural resource management are lost if there\n            are lapses in governance. In Papua New Guinea, progress in\n            managing the growth of the oil and gas industry has not led\n            to sustained economic benefits to the country because of the\n            macroeconomic mismanagement of oil revenues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guina - The Petroleum Exploration\n            Technical Assistance Project and the Petroleum Exploration\n            and Development Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Papua New Guina - The Petroleum\n            Exploration Technical Assistance Project and the Petroleum\n            Exploration and Development Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1944185/papua-new-guina-petroleum-exploration-technical-assistance-project-petroleum-exploration-development-technical-assistance-project","projn":"PG-Petroleum Tech.
