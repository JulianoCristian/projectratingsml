Identified\n            as lessons gleaned from the project are the following: 1)\n            Continuity is key to long-term development impact. 2) There\n            is nothing \"simplified\" about doing APL as phase I\n            is subject to an ICR and phase II goes through similar\n            preparation procedures as any regular SIL. In addition, in\n            countries such as Guinea which are in low-case scenario and\n            have therefore a very small IDA allocation, there is no\n            guarantee to move to phase 2 even when the trigger\n            indicators have been met. 3) Public-private partnership\n            (involving small and medium enterprises and the public\n            sector) improves efficiency in delivering municipal\n            services: The first lesson from phase I shows that\n            concessioning out the collection of household waste to SMEs\n            is an efficient and sustainable solution for African cities.\n            It works, it reduces costs, it allows to improve the\n            environment and public health, creates jobs and promotes\n            entrepreneurship and the population is willing to pay for a\n            service rendered. The second lesson is that it works because\n            a set of enabling measures is in place. 4) The key to\n            success was the introduction of municipal audits which for\n            the first time provided baseline information on the spatial,\n            organizational and financial attributes of Guinean\n            municipalities and helped shape municipal programs which\n            were not politically based but instead based on priority\n            needs set in local realities and expressed at the local\n            level. 5) Capacity building works better if it is integrated\n            in a contractual arrangement and linked to investments than\n            if it is a free-standing component. 6) Street addressing has\n            proved instrumental to achieving successful project\n            outcomes. It was essential in determining solid waste\n            collection zones, supporting the programming of secondary\n            streets rehabilitation, and has helped to provide strong\n            baseline information on cities. 7) Counterpart funding\n            availability is strongly linked to a fully owned, well\n            justified, and enforceable local commitment. 8) Clear\n            implementation arrangements are essential ingredients for success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -

The project has three components. 1) Improvement to\n            priority infrastructure and services in Conakry includes a)\n            solid waste management, which will increase the level of\n            garbage collection and limit the impact of waste production;\n            b) neighborhood upgrading, which will support rehabilitation\n            and maintenance operations on Conakry's secondary\n            roads; c) primary road network, which will improve traffic\n            at critical blockage points at Conakry. 2) Assistance to\n            secondary cities will support the decentralization process\n            by helping mayors to better plan for the need of their\n            communes. 3) Institutional strengthening will provide\n            support to operational units and improved financing of\n            priority services, such as solid waste management and\n            secondary road maintenance.
