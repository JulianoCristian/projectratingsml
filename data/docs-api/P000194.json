The objectives of the project were: (i) to\n            contribute to the reduction of maternal and child morbidity\n            and mortality; (ii) to promote birth spacing and strengthen\n            the National Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning\n            Program; (iii) to assist in controlling the AIDS epidemic;\n            (iv) to improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of\n            the health system; and (v) to improve the demographic data\n            base needed for socio-economic planning. IDA performance on\n            this project was highly satisfactory at the identification\n            stage, and satisfactory in preparation assistance,\n            appraisal, and supervision. The Borrower's performance\n            can be rated as highly satisfactory for preparation,\n            satisfactory for implementation, and partially deficient for\n            covenant compliance. Mostly because of the crisis, the\n            project's outcome deserves a rating in the quality of\n            health services of unsatisfactory. The following lessons\n            which are relevant for future project design both in\n            health/population and in Burundi, can be learned from the\n            experience of this Population and Health Project: 1) a\n            project development impact may be jeopardized in a situation\n            of continuous political instability and civil disturbances;\n            2) A project is implemented better when the Government is\n            committed, when key staff of the implementing agency are\n            involved in project design and preparation, and when\n            beneficiary opinions are taken into account during project\n            preparation; 3) Managerial and institutional capacities to\n            develop project activities and key functions need to be\n            carefully assessed during project preparation, and adequate\n            strengthening must be provided throughout project\n            implementation; 4) Strengthening health centers is not\n            enough to ensure an improvement in overall health service\n            delivery; reference health facilities must also be upgraded;\n            5) Rehabilitation activities should emphasize equally\n            physical and qualitative inputs and outputs (increased\n            service capacity and quality); 6) Long term technical\n            assistance can contribute to capacity building and to\n            project implementation if the adviser has a counterpart who\n            participates in all project activities and who is given\n            increasing responsibilities; and 7) Performance indicators\n            should be designed and used to monitor the progress of the\n            project on an annual basis in order to facilitate the\n            assessment of the achievements of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
