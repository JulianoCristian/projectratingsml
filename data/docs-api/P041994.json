Borrower\n            performance for the Vocational Training Project was\n            satisfactory, while the two Education Quality Improvement\n            Projects had highly satisfactory Borrower performances. This\n            assessment confirms a number of education sector lessons:\n            1) Preschool attendance helps reduce grade repetition and\n            improves long-term academic achievement for low-income\n            students. 2) A longer school day may improve test scores for\n            disadvantaged students. To maximize performance in higher\n            grades, students in lower grades might spend part of the\n            extra time practicing the prerequisite basic skills. 3)\n            Educational quality depends on a strong and functional\n            supervisory chain that supervises teachers closely to see\n            that government policies and learning activities are carried\n            out effectively. 4) Enhance project efficiency through\n            instructional methods that enable most of the students to\n            achieve educational objectives within the prescribed\n            instructional time. Further research and experimentation\n            will help determine which instructional activities are more\n            cost-effective in the Uruguayan context. 5)\n            Vocational-technical education project appraisals may\n            overestimate the number of likely graduates and not\n            adequately take into account dropout rates or changing\n            demand for training. In future project appraisals take into\n            account country experience on dropout rates as well as\n            demand changes during times of economic hardship."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay -

The following are among the lessons learned\n            from this project: 1) Involvement of stakeholders and\n            beneficiaries in early stages of project design promotes\n            ownership and sustainability. 2) A functioning and\n            up-and-running monitoring and evaluation system from the\n            beginning of implementation is important in guiding project\n            implementation. 3) A training module in preschool education\n            is necessary to prepare teachers for the characteristics of\n            the students entering school. 4) Bank support to the\n            government for the implementation of the full time school\n            (FTS) model has been key to its institutionalization within\n            the education system. 5) Time spent on tasks as well as\n            improvements in the quality of tasks leads to better\n            learning. 6) Developing and using tools to focus and plan is\n            key to achieve project targets and more efficiently identify\n            and implement the project activities. 7) The FTS model is an\n            effective way to improve learning outcomes while addressing\n            equity concerns. 8) Experience from this reveals how crucial\n            it is to have a solid and continuous team for a smooth,\n            timely and coherent project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ururguay -
