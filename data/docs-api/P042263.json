The main lessons to\n            be drawn from the implementation of this project include: 1)\n            Emphasis could have been placed on the importance of a\n            complete institutional separation of Telecommunications\n            Regulatory Commission (TRC) from the Ministry of Post and\n            Telecommunications (MOPT), in spite of intensive training\n            and independent budgets, building a long term sustainable\n            regulatory and institutional capacity in newly created\n            entities takes time. 2) A strong display of Government\n            commitment is crucial in attracting private investors,\n            however, the issue of maximizing privatization proceeds at\n            the expense of full competition could have been addressed by\n            Public Enterprise Reform Commission. 3) Proper\n            implementation of sector reforms and market liberalization,\n            followed by transparent privatization transactions, have\n            successfully resulted in substantial private investment\n            in-flows in the telecommunications sector. 4) Reforms could\n            have focused more on rural access by stipulating roll out\n            obligations and service targets in operating licenses. 5)\n            The successful private operation of value-added and other\n            marginal telecommunications service created new job\n            opportunities and reduced staff fears of privatization. 6)\n            The concerns of the Labor unions were addressed to reduce\n            resistance to change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Telecommunications Regulation\n            and Public Enterprise Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka -

    regulatory Commission and strengthen its regulatory\n            authority; 2) assist SLTA in: (a) improving its\n            administrative and technical capabilities to plan and\n            control the use of radio frequency spectrum; and (b)\n            establishing a computerized radio frequency management and\n            monitoring system; and 3) facilitate the divestiture of\n
