In strictly quantitative\n            terms, the project has achieved or even exceeded its\n            appraisal targets. Bank staff involvement in the\n            implementation of the project has been professional in all\n            respects. The project was less successful in regard to the\n            teacher upgrading program, not so much in quantitative terms\n            but in terms of the content of the program. In retrospect,\n            the program would probably have been more effective if its\n            main thrust had been to impart teaching skills needed in\n            classroom situations (eg. preparation of lesson plans,\n            teacher-pupil interaction, improving classroom delivery,\n            etc), rather than trying to upgrade the teachers'\n            academic knowledge. The project confirms the importance of\n            orienting in-service teacher up-grading programs toward\n            acquisition of teaching skills and classroom techniques\n            rather than upgrading the academic qualifications of the\n            participants ."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -
