Firstly, it used local\n            energy sources, secondly it used renewable energy sources\n            and thirdly, it used clean sources of energy. Armenia\n            Renewable Energy Project designed the scheme for small\n            hydropower stations, and developed model business plans and\n            guidelines for the renewable energy sector. Ninety Two\n            hydropower stations were constructed under the project which\n            would meet six percent of the internal demand for\n            electricity.
