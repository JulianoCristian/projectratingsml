All primary and junior secondary\n            schools will, over the course of the Tonga Education Policy\n            (EPF), participate in the results-based TSGP. The amount of\n            each school grant will be governed by a funding formula that\n            reflects: (i) enrollment; (ii) the extent to which the\n            school meets or exceeds the
