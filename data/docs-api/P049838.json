Some lessons learned included:\n            realism in setting performance targets is a key to achieving\n            results in weak capacity contexts. In the areas of\n            privatization (infrastructure in particular) and regulation,\n            it will have helped to recognize politically sensitive\n            sectors and topics that would take time and more high level\n            Bank and development partner dialogue with the Government,\n            and set less ambitious or more realistic timetable for the\n            completion of infrastructure reform as well as the creation\n            and strengthening of regulatory and competition agencies.\n            Timely project restructuring represents an opportunity to\n            revamp project design and implementation which was missed in\n            the case of this project, in spite of obvious design\n            shortcomings and difficulties to report on the\n            project's outputs and outcomes. Sustained\n            borrower's commitment rather than on the length of\n            project implementation is essential to the achievement of\n            development objectives. The more the life of this project\n            increased, the more adversely the positive results of the\n            early years were affected. The existence of a large\n            undisbursed balance until the ultimate closing of the\n            project invited the Government to continue requesting the\n            extension of the closing date even though the infrastructure\n            for successful implementation had been weakened. Due\n            diligence in privatization processes is essential to make\n            sure the Borrower gets the right private sector partner in a\n            privatization transaction. There is a critical need to do\n            thorough checks on the solidity of any financial commitments\n            in the bid, and to have a full understanding of the\n            structure of consortia and the corporate strategy of the\n            different partners in each consortium. If this had been done\n            systematically, there are some contractual arrangements that\n            would not have ended up failing. This due diligence is also\n            needed to get the best out of transaction advisors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Privatization and Private Sector\n            Development
