Some lessons learned included:\n            geothermal development is a risky business, with only about\n            a 30 percent success rate. Given the risk adverse nature of\n            investors and of Bank management, a renewable energy project\n            with a certain portion of the grant designated for\n            geothermal development might have resulted in a more robust\n            pipeline of subprojects and have been more successful in\n            meeting the Global Environment Objective (GEO). Given that\n            pipeline development is critical to the success of a\n            regional program, it should be pursued as early as possible\n            during project preparation. Close cooperation between\n            regions on similar innovative geothermal development\n            programs resulted in synergy and efficiencies in terms of\n            knowledge and product innovation.

This safeguards section of the operational\n            manual assesses negative environmental impacts and lists\n            suggestions for mitigating them. Among the risks considered\n            are these: The land requirement will lead to vegetal loss\n            soil, soil erosion, landslides, ad land ownership issues.\n            These could be mitigated by using single drill pads (several\n            wells), revegetating, and providing adequate land\n            compensation. Taking water for drilling may lead to local\n            watershed impacts, and damming and diverting local streams.\n            These effects could be alleviated by taking water from\n            streams with high flow rates, coinciding drilling with the\n            rainy season, building temporary reservoirs, and liaising\n            with local farmers to consider their usage. Taking water\n            from reservoirs may result in hydrothermal eruptions,\n            lowering of the water table, an increase in the steam zone,\n            and saline intrusion. To offset these effects, avoid areas\n            where there's a propensity for hydrothermal eruptions\n            and carefully manage resources. To prevent effects from\n            waste disposal into streams and waterways, treat effluent\n            and remove undesired constituents, reinject all waste\n            fluids, use a cascaded approach towards waste fluids, and\n            dilute brine. Also when reinjecting, plan carefully and\n            monitor flow patterns before re-injecting. Minimize air\n            emissions by scrubbing hydrogen disulfide and treating other\n            non-condensable gases. Reduce nose with mufflers and silencers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Europe and Central Asia - Geothermal Energy\n            Development Program (Geofund) Project : operations manual\n            safeguards
