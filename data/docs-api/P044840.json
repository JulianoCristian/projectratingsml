The operation\n            consists of a tried-and-proven type of project,\n            consequently, there are no radically new lessons that this\n            project experience can provide to practitioners,\n            researchers, and the international community. However, the\n            following elements would be noteworthy. 1) Coalition\n            building pays off - i.e., the Government's strong\n            commitment and donor support were uninterrupted, even\n            increased in spite of the political turmoil, and change of\n            government in 2001, delivering the highly satisfactory\n            outcome. 2) Good and well-balanced operations management was\n            key to effective implementation. While technically and\n            conceptually, the project featured no outstanding\n            innovation, what the project excelled in however, is that\n            all functions within its operation were very well\n            balanced-nothing was overdone, there were no noticeable weak\n            links in its organization and operation either, resulting in\n            high efficiency and effectiveness levels. 3) Strong focus on\n            building community-based organizations (CBOs) and their\n            networks is key to sustainable institutional development at\n            the community level. While this approach is already common\n            elsewhere among social investment funds (SIFs), it has\n            nonetheless been under-utilized in Europe and Central Asia\n            (ECA). But the project proved the validity of this approach,\n            through its active support to strengthening CBOs and their\n            networks, through the provision of information and resource centers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Social Investment Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - Social Investment Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/5836262/moldova-social-investment-fund-project","projn":"MD-Social Investment Fund -- P044840","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Health Economics & Finance","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Moldova","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050601144750"},"subsc":"General education sector,Roads and highways,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General public administration sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account, Benefit Analysis, bills,\n            Borrower/Implementing Agency, Capacity Building, case\n            studies, CBA, coal, commodities, community level, community\n            members, consumer surplus, contractors, Cost Benefit, Cost\n            Benefit Analysis, cost control, cost estimates, cost\n            savings, cost-benefit analyses,  Currency Unit,\n            depreciation, developmental objectives, direct costs,\n            discount rate, donor community, economic activity, economic\n            analysis, economic value, educational attainment,\n            elasticity, elasticity of demand, Exchange Rate,\n            Expenditure, Expenditure Category, extreme poverty,\n            financial crisis, foreign exchange, fuels, furnaces, health\n            programs, heating system, Human Development, Human\n            Development Sector Unit, impact evaluation, Impact\n            Indicators, Imports, income, Indicators/Log, Institutional\n            Development, labor market, local authorities, local\n            currency, local level, local levels, local officials, local\n            realities, maintenance costs, market prices, monetary terms,\n            MPs, NGOs/private sector, opportunity cost, overhead,\n            overhead costs, per capita income, policy measures, poor\n            communities, poverty reduction, poverty targeting, present\n            value, Present Value/Economic, procurement, productivity,\n            projects/programs, Quality Assurance, Quality Assurance\n            Group, real terms, risk management, rural areas, rural\n            communities, rural population, rural poverty, savings,\n            service provision, service quality, social capital, social\n            costs, Social Development, social inclusion, social\n            infrastructure, social protection, social sectors, social\n            services, streams, tax structure, technical aspects,\n            technical assistance, trade deficit, unemployment, unit\n            costs, valuation, Value/Economic rate of return, wages,\n            water supply"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020043-SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND (SIF)\n            PILOT PROJECT,TF022663-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND PROJECT,TF025547-PHRD-SOCIAL INSURANCE\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF026061-TA CTF FOR MOLDOVA HEALTH &\n            S.

Until recently Valeriu hated to go\n            to school, especially during the winter, because classrooms\n            were so cold that he had to wear thick warm clothes while in\n            class. Although the heat was turned on full blast, he often\n            had to blow into his fists to keep his fingers warm because\n            he could not write with frozen hands. Due to a lack of\n            school space, classes were held in two shifts\u0097one in the\n            morning, the other in the afternoon. Classes in the\n            afternoon shift had to be shortened by 15-20 minutes so\n            students would not be walking home in frigid darkness. When\n            this village of 2,000 inhabitants decided to repair the\n            school and improve its heating system with the support of\n            the World Bank financed Moldova Social Investment Fund,\n            Valeriu contributed his modest savings to the village-wide\n            campaign to raise additional local funds. By dropping his\n            pennies into the communal collection box, traditionally used\n            for elections, Valeriu not only contributed to the campaign,\n            but also gave it its name. It became known as \u0091a penny for\n            my school.\u0092 Two years have passed since repairs were\n            completed, and the school is revitalized. Since additional\n            classrooms were built, all 310 students go to school in one\n            morning shift. Classrooms are bright and warm, yet heating\n            costs only $800 compared to $7,000 in previous winters, when\n            children were shivering in their coats.

Until recently Valeriu hated to go\n            to school, especially during the winter, because classrooms\n            were so cold that he had to wear thick warm clothes while in\n            class. Although the heat was turned on full blast, he often\n            had to blow into his fists to keep his fingers warm because\n            he could not write with frozen hands. Due to a lack of\n            school space, classes were held in two shifts\u0097one in the\n            morning, the other in the afternoon. Classes in the\n            afternoon shift had to be shortened by 15-20 minutes so\n            students would not be walking home in frigid darkness. When\n            this village of 2,000 inhabitants decided to repair the\n            school and improve its heating system with the support of\n            the World Bank financed Moldova Social Investment Fund,\n            Valeriu contributed his modest savings to the village-wide\n            campaign to raise additional local funds. By dropping his\n            pennies into the communal collection box, traditionally used\n            for elections, Valeriu not only contributed to the campaign,\n            but also gave it its name. It became known as \u0091a penny for\n            my school.\u0092 Two years have passed since repairs were\n            completed, and the school is revitalized. Since additional\n            classrooms were built, all 310 students go to school in one\n            morning shift. Classrooms are bright and warm, yet heating\n            costs only $800 compared to $7,000 in previous winters, when\n            children were shivering in their coats. Funds were also used\n            to buy new school furniture and supplies, including new\n            textbooks. Moreover, the school has evolved into a true\n            community center whose different activities attract\n            inhabitants of all ages, including both Valeriu and his\n            grandmother, who is raising him."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldavie - Des centimes pour une \u00e9cole de village"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - Helping pennies add up\n            for a village school : Moldavie - Des centimes pour une\n            \u00e9cole de village"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2003/11/23843093/moldova-helping-pennies-add-up-village-school-moldavie-des-centimes-pour-une-\u00e9cole-de-village","count":"Moldova","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"activities, afternoon shift, campaign,\n            classrooms, collection, completed, elections, home,\n            Investment Fund, local funds, minutes, name, repair,\n            savings, school furniture, school space, Social Investment,\n            textbooks, Village, Village School"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Social protection and risk management,Human development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Moldavie - Des centimes pour une \u00e9cole\n            de village"}},"topic":"Education Districts m1327034 2141,Secondary Education m1327058 481,Education m1327048 470,Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Tertiary Education m1326349 482","projn":"MD-Social Investment Fund -- P044840","subtopic":"Social Accountability,Education For All,Primary Education,Tertiary Education,Education Finance","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Social Development,Education","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20150121023633"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans!$!517208"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans!$!517208"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Eastern Europe and Balkans!$!517208"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Roads and highways,General public administration sector,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General education sector,Other social services","theme":"Participation and civic engagement,Other human development,Rural services and infrastructure,Other social protection and risk management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Social Development,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Education Districts m1327034 2141,Secondary Education m1327058 481,Education m1327048 470,Education Efficiency m1327731 2135,Tertiary Education m1326349 482","owner":"Social Protect &  Labor - GP (GSPDR)","Environmental Category":["C"],"trustfund":"TF027119-PHRD-SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF020043-SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND (SIF)\n            PILOT PROJECT,TF022663-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND PROJECT,TF034511-GEORGIA - MUNICIPAL\n            INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION,TF034540-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF034595-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF034814-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF034901-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF035090-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF035315-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF035555-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF035789-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF035961-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INSURANCE MANAGEMENT,TF036443-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF025547-PHRD-SOCIAL INSURANCE\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF026061-TA CTF FOR MOLDOVA HEALTH &\n            S.
