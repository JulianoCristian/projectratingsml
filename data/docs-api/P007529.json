The\n            project elements are summarized below: (a) dam and storage\n            reservoir at the Bacurato site with minimum provision for\n            adding hydroelectric power facilities in the future; (b)\n            access road to the site and a camp to house construction and\n            operating personnel; (c) a diversion dam at the Sinaloa de\n            Leyva site to divert water to main canals on each side of\n            the river; (d) wells to augment surface water supply; (e) a\n            concrete-lined irrigation distribution system of main\n            canals, laterals, and sublaterals and devices to measure\n            water delivery; (f) a complete drainage system of main and\n            secondary drains; (g) roads along canals and drains for\n            operation and maintenance and for use by farmers; (h) houses\n            for ditch riders, a telephone network, gauging stations and\n            project facilities to serve as operating headquarters; (i)\n            land clearing and leveling; and, (j) intensive extension\n            service during initial period of project.

The\n            project elements are summarized below: (a) dam and storage\n            reservoir at the Bacurato site with minimum provision for\n            adding hydroelectric power facilities in the future; (b)\n            access road to the site and a camp to house construction and\n            operating personnel; (c) a diversion dam at the Sinaloa de\n            Leyva site to divert water to main canals on each side of\n            the river; (d) wells to augment surface water supply; (e) a\n            concrete-lined irrigation distribution system of main\n            canals, laterals, and sublaterals and devices to measure\n            water delivery; (f) a complete drainage system of main and\n            secondary drains; (g) roads along canals and drains for\n            operation and maintenance and for use by farmers; (h) houses\n            for ditch riders, a telephone network, gauging stations and\n            project facilities to serve as operating headquarters; (i)\n            land clearing and leveling; and, (j) intensive extension\n            service during initial period of project. This report\n            comprises two impact evaluation reports for Mexico an\n            Morocco, and an overview which synthesizes the findings of\n            both impact evaluations regarding the extent of, and reasons\n            for, sustainability a compares the impact of irrigation\n            systems design on project performanc striking feature of all\n            four projects is the lower agricultural and ec performance\n            than that estimated at the time of audit. Weaker commodity\n            an inadequate development approach in one project, lower\n            than expected efficiencies, insufficient attention to\n            operation and maintenance in a projects, and damage to the\n            environment and natural resources have bee main factors\n            affecting performance. However, with one exception, which\n            performed poorly, the degree of success in the transfer of\n            technology respect of both irrigation practice and\n            agricultural productivity has continued to be sustained in\n            the other three projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1973/11/726391/mexico-rio-sinaloa-irrigation-project","projn":"MX-Sinaloa Irrigation -- P007529","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912484284"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to resources,adequate\n            supply,agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,alluvial deposits,canals,channels,clay,climatic\n            conditions,competitive bidding,Construction,construction\n            work,crop production,cubic meter,demand for water,disposable\n            income,distribution of water,distribution\n            system,distribution systems,diversion,double\n            cropping,drainage system,drought,economic\n            situation,employment,evaporation,exploitation,export,FARMERS,farming,farms,gauging,GNP,groundwater,groundwater\n            pumping,groundwater use,groundwater\n            withdrawals,INCOME,Income\n            distribution,inflation,Insurance,irrigation\n            development,Irrigation District,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,labor force,land productivity,land\n            reform,Land Tenure,land use,livestock products,Maintenance\n            Costs,market prices,National Water\n            Plan,precipitation,producers,Production\n            Costs,programs,pumping,pumping rates,pumps,rainfall,rainfed\n            crops,Reclamation,river basins,sea,Soils,storage\n            capacity,stream beds,surface water,surface water\n            supply,surface water systems,surplus\n            water,town,unemployment,use of water,Water\n            Availability,water charges,water facilities,Water Law,water\n            levels,Water Resources,water rights,water scarcity,water\n            shortages,Water Supply,water systems,water use,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to resources,adequate\n            supply,agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,alluvial deposits,canals,channels,clay,climatic\n            conditions,competitive bidding,Construction,construction\n            work,crop production,cubic meter,demand for water,disposable\n            income,distribution of water,distribution\n            system,distribution systems,diversion,double\n            cropping,drainage system,drought,economic\n            situation,employment,evaporation,exploitation,export,FARMERS,farming,farms,gauging,GNP,groundwater,groundwater\n            pumping,groundwater use,groundwater\n            withdrawals,INCOME,Income\n            distribution,inflation,Insurance,irrigation\n            development,Irrigation District,irrigation\n            systems,irrigation water,labor force,land productivity,land\n            reform,Land Tenure,land use,livestock products,Maintenance\n            Costs,market prices,National Water\n            Plan,precipitation,producers,Production\n            Costs,programs,pumping,pumping rates,pumps,rainfall,rainfed\n            crops,Reclamation,river basins,sea,Soils,storage\n            capacity,stream beds,surface water,surface water\n            supply,surface water systems,surplus\n            water,town,unemployment,use of water,Water\n            Availability,water charges,water facilities,Water Law,water\n            levels,Water Resources,water rights,water scarcity,water\n            shortages,Water Supply,water systems,water use,wells"}},"owner":"WB Off:Mexico - MX & CO CMU (LCC1C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"281"},"facets":{}}}
