Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: (1) the success of\n            SCP II being implemented closely behind SCP I demonstrates\n            that follow-on projects should continue directly and without\n            delay from the initial project in order to: (i) benefit from\n            experienced staff and routine procedures already in place,\n            and (ii) avoid or minimize delay in achieving the objectives\n            of the combined project; (2) the unfavorable experience with\n            deviating from the original Dhiarizos tunnel construction\n            concepts and methods shows that such action should be\n            avoided unless a thorough investigation and a full review of\n            the proposed deviation by independent experts is undertaken;\n            (3) experience with this project suggests that quality\n            problems under supply contracts should be minimized through\n            independent expert checks at manufacturers' plants; and\n            (4) the land use conflict experienced under the project\n            between irrigated farming and tourism points to the need for\n            thorough prior investigation of competing demands for basic\n            project resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cyprus - Southern Conveyor Project for Water\n            Resources Development - Phase II (SCP

The Southern Conveyor Project's primary\n            objectives are (i) to ensure adequate water supplies to four\n            major population areas and nearby villages, and (ii) to\n            maintain vitally important irrigated crop production in an\n            area threatened by aquifer seawater intrusion and extend\n            irrigation in other selected areas.  The project also aims\n            to rationalize further the utilization of the country's\n            scarce water resources through appropriate institutional\n            reform and the implementation of realistic cost recovery\n            measures for both domestic and irrigation water.  The second\n            phase of the project supplements phase I through the\n            following:  (a) the Dhiarizos diversion works, including a\n            tunnel; (b) irrigation distribution networks for 4,335 ha;\n            and (c) domestic water treatment works at Limassol and\n            Tersephanou, the Tersephanou-Nicosia conveyor and about 20\n            rural water supply schemes.  In addition, phase II provides\n            (d) on-farm development through the medium-term; (e)\n            provision of O&M and miscellaneous equipment; and (f)\n            provision of technical services and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cyprus - Southern Conveyor Project For Water\n            Resources Development (Phase II)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cyprus - Southern Conveyor\n
