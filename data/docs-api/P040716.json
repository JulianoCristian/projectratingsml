The project had also launched\n            major activities on formulation of the new road safety\n            strategy, development of road data base, preparation of road\n            master plan, and revision of design and maintenance standards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan Highway Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Azerbaijan Highway Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/10/25485164/azerbaijan-highway-program","count":"Azerbaijan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accident risks, local roads, accident,\n            highway, vehicle, road section, road networks, travel, its,\n            road, secondary roads, transit, road network, road sector,\n            transport, rural areas, road safety, income, fuel, transport\n            corridors, road users, investments, loading, maintenance,\n            motorway, highway program, travel time, safety, road\n            infrastructure, road projects, road maintenance, road\n            sections, land acquisition, highway project, wealth, vehicle\n            maintenance, primary roads, infrastructure, motorway\n            network, roads, international transit"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Trade and integration,Public sector governance,Rural development,Financial and private sector development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Programa de Autopistas en Azerbaiy\u00e1n"}},"projn":"AZ-Highway Project -- P040716,AZ-Highway 2 - Additional Financing -- P100667","topic":"Transport and Sustainable Development\n            m1327165 790,Transport m1326661 135,Transport Infrastructure m1327632 1803,Transport and Logistics Services m1326915 793,Transport Governance m1327401 1823,Transport Economics m1326662 162","subtopic":"Rural Transport,Rural Roads & Transport,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Roads and Highways Performance","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Transport,Rural Development","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08333e44f_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Rural services and infrastructure,Urban services and housing for the poor,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Rural services and infrastructure,Trade facilitation and market access","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Transport,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Transport and Sustainable Development\n            m1327165 790,Transport m1326661 135,Transport Infrastructure m1327632 1803,Transport and Logistics Services m1326915 793,Transport Governance m1327401 1823,Transport Economics m1326662 162","owner":"GTITR -ECA (GTI03),Transport & ICT - GP (GTIDR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"3":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"96085"},"11235828":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2009/09/11235828/azerbaijan-highway-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2009/09/11235828/azerbaijan-highway-project","new_url":"2009/09/11235828/azerbaijan-highway-project","disclosure_date":"2009-10-19T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/10/21/000334955_20091021025609/Rendered/INDEX/ICR10940P0407110disclosed0101191091.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/10/21/000334955_20091021025609/Rendered/PDF/ICR10940P0407110disclosed0101191091.pdf","credit_no":"3517","docdt":"2009-09-29T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2009-10-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Highway Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Highway Project for\n            Azerbaijan were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was low, the Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the design and\n            implementation of projects in the road sector should give\n            equal or more weight to the issues of improving the\n            effectiveness of the government's investment program\n            than to the issue of quantity of expenditures. There appears\n            to be a marked emphasis during project implementation on\n            funding issues, disbursement rates and contract execution of\n            the civil works under the project. This is clearly reflected\n            in supervision reports and letters to the Borrower. However,\n            improvements to the effectiveness of investments generally\n            did not receive the same attention and were mostly relegated\n            to the discussions of delays in implementing a contract in\n            the technical assistance component. The project is an\n            excellent example of the benefits derived from a high level\n            of flexibility in project implementation. The Bank\u00b4s\n            decision to include in the project the construction of the\n            Tovuz by-pass involved a higher level of risk in terms of\n            the complexity of the civil works financed under the\n            project. Nevertheless the risks were approached with the\n            utmost conviction and professionalism by both the Borrower\n            and the Bank and the result was not only a substantial\n            improvement to the country's road network but also to\n            the legal and regulatory framework of land acquisition.\n            Similarly, the use of further savings to finance the\n            preparation and supervision of a follow-on project ensured\n            not only an effective use of the available funds, but\n            facilitated implementation of future

Within the\n            corridors of the two proposed bypasses, agriculture is the\n            predominant type of land use and structures or elements of\n            higher ecological importance have not been identified. Thus,\n            impacts will mainly consist of losses of farmland within the\n            existing right of way, and the loss of some few shrubs and\n            trees growing within the selected corridors. To mitigate\n            this impact, all land that has been temporarily used for\n            construction will be restored to the initial state. Work\n            site selection should avoid the removal of trees and shrubs\n            and topsoil will be covered with grass, or removed and\n            reused for embankments or site rehabilitation after\n            completion. During the construction period, exhaust fumes,\n            noise, dust, and potential spills of harmful substances\n            could affect human health. Confine sites for vehicle\n            maintenance and fuelling to contain spilled lubricants and\n            fuels; provide a secure, impermeably lined container to\n            store chemicals and oil at a designated distance from\n            surface waters; regularly separate and collect toxic and\n            harmful waste as well as used tires and dispose of them at\n            authorized site. Minimization of dust development may be\n            achieved by periodically watering the roads and by using\n            covered trucks. All construction debris should be removed\n            and disposed of properly. To help minimize the need of waste\n            disposal and reduce adverse impacts on the environment,\n            consider processing and reusing existing materials such as\n            sub-base and surface materials, or materials from demolished\n            bridges. Other impacts concern soil erosion and chronic\n            siltation from  borrow pit operations.

Within the\n            corridors of the two proposed bypasses, agriculture is the\n            predominant type of land use and structures or elements of\n            higher ecological importance have not been identified. Thus,\n            impacts will mainly consist of losses of farmland within the\n            existing right of way, and the loss of some few shrubs and\n            trees growing within the selected corridors. To mitigate\n            this impact, all land that has been temporarily used for\n            construction will be restored to the initial state. Work\n            site selection should avoid the removal of trees and shrubs\n            and topsoil will be covered with grass, or removed and\n            reused for embankments or site rehabilitation after\n            completion. During the construction period, exhaust fumes,\n            noise, dust, and potential spills of harmful substances\n            could affect human health. Confine sites for vehicle\n            maintenance and fuelling to contain spilled lubricants and\n            fuels; provide a secure, impermeably lined container to\n            store chemicals and oil at a designated distance from\n            surface waters; regularly separate and collect toxic and\n            harmful waste as well as used tires and dispose of them at\n            authorized site. Minimization of dust development may be\n            achieved by periodically watering the roads and by using\n            covered trucks. All construction debris should be removed\n            and disposed of properly. To help minimize the need of waste\n            disposal and reduce adverse impacts on the environment,\n            consider processing and reusing existing materials such as\n            sub-base and surface materials, or materials from demolished\n            bridges. Other impacts concern soil erosion and chronic\n            siltation from  borrow pit operations.
