This\n            operation was exceptional for the quality of the analytic\n            work that had preceded it, notably the Tunisia: Global\n            Integration Study. This work served to identify key problem\n            areas, to a degree that is almost prescient in light of the\n            events of January 2011, and provided a platform and\n            justification for the measures contained in the operation.\n            The limits of gradualism. The reform efforts under this\n            program have focused on bringing gradual change where\n            opportunities arose, on the assumption that society was only\n            prepared for incremental moves. As it turned out, the\n            January 2011 revolution demonstrated that the said society\n            was actually hungering for quantum change. The need to\n            factor in more explicitly political tensions in assessing\n            risks. It is noteworthy that while the analytic work\n            indicated clearly the social tensions arising from the\n            continuation of Government policies, the discussion of risks\n            in the program document focused exclusively on the\n            likelihood of external shocks and lack of supply response to\n            policy measures. The need to go beyond measures that\n            initiate a reform process but that are not clearly linked to\n            the subsequent phases of this process. As shown in the\n            discussion on the prior actions, some of these measures were\n            completed but there was no significant impact or substantive\n            improvement in the areas of interest due to weak\n            implementation or lack of follow up on the measures. The\n            need to spend more time upfront on the development of the\n            monitoring system, including selection of development\n            indicators. While these indicators must necessarily take\n            into the account the impacts expected during the period of\n            the project, they must also be selected with an eye to\n            measurability as well as relevance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Integration and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Integration and\n            Competitiveness Development Policy Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/03/16207532/tunisia-integration-competitiveness-development-policy-loan-project","projn":"TN-Integration And Competitiveness Dpl -- P095388","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Debt Markets,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120405005912"},"subsc":"Banking,Other industry,Micro- and SME finance,General industry and trade sector,Capital markets","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, action plan,\n            anti-competitive practices, arrears, balance of payments,\n            Bank assets, bank behavior, Bank credibility, Bank\n            financing, Bank Lending, Bank Official, Bank Ratings, banks,\n            Beneficiary, best practice, best practices, Borrower,\n            borrowing, borrowing costs, budgeting, business climate,\n            business operations, businesses, capital flows, Capital\n            markets, capitalization, CAPITALS, Central Bank, Central\n            Bank of Tunisia, Central government debt, civil society,\n            commerce, commercial bank, commercial banks, control system,\n            CURRENCY, Current account, current account deficit, Customs,\n            debt, deficits, deposit, Development Bank, disbursement,\n            Disbursements, diversification, domestic market, economic\n            climate, economic growth, economic liberalization, economic\n            policies, economic policy, economic reforms, economic\n            system, electronic platform, employment, Exchange Rate,\n            Export Competitiveness, Export development, export growth,\n            export sector, external financing, external shocks,\n            financial crisis, financial market, financial markets,\n            financial sector reform, financing requirements, Foreign\n            debt, Foreign Direct Investment, foreign financing, Gender,\n            Gender Aspects, global economy, governance issues,\n            Government policies, Government reform, Gross Domestic\n            Product, ID, identification number, Implementing Agencies,\n            Implementing Agency, import duties, indirect impact,\n            inflation, Innovation, installation, international best\n            practice, international best practices, international\n            capital, international capital markets, international\n            financial markets, international standards, International\n            Trade, IP, issuance, land reform, Lending Instrument,\n            liquidity, LOAN, macroeconomic stability, Medium Enterprise,\n            micro-finance, microfinance, Minister, Ministers, Monetary\n            Fund, Non Performing Loans, non-performing loans,\n            nonperforming loans, NPL, performance indicator, Performance\n            Indicators, physical presence, preferential, private\n            capital, private investment, Private Sector, Private Sector\n            Development, privatization, privatizations, profitability,\n            Public Information, public policy, rates of inflation,\n            Reduction of cost, registry, regulatory framework,\n            repayment, reserve, reserves, result, RESULTS, return, risk\n            taking, Social Development, social security, software\n            system, Stock Market, stock market capitalization,\n            Structural Adjustment, Supervision, Tax, tax exemption, Tax\n            policy, taxation, technical issues, time frame, trade\n            sector, tranche, tranches, transaction, transaction costs,\n            transparency, Transport, unemployment, Union, urban\n            development, venture capital, warrants"}},"owner":"Econ.

It is also a cornerstone of the World\n            Bank's program in Tunisia as outlined in the Country\n            Assistance Strategy (FY05-08) and the Country Assistance\n            Strategy Progress Report (2007) that set out an indicative\n            program for FY09-10. This operation is also expected to be a\n            major component of the new Country Partnership Strategy\n            (FYI0-13). The main thrust of the program is to continue\n            growth-enhancing reforms anchored around a deeper\n            integration of Tunisia to the global economy. More urgently,\n            the ICL will assist the Government in responding to the\n            global financial crisis which is beginning to expose\n            Tunisia's inherent macroeconomic vulnerability to\n            growth in Europe. The immediate objective of the Government\n            is therefore to accelerate reforms, send a strong signal to\n            investors and mitigate recession contagion risks in the\n            coming years. The global financial crisis and economic\n            downturn will no doubt drive policy changes in\n            Tunisia's main competitors for direct foreign\n            investment and trade.
