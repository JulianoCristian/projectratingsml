Some lessons learned\n            includes: in the case of Sierra Leone the Governance Reform\n            and Growth (GRG) series helped to consolidate and entrench\n            the local councils which were re-established after a 30 year\n            absence. This resulted from a strong shared understanding\n            between Government and many external stakeholders about the\n            importance of re-establishing government presence around the\n            country, and the role that the lack of such a government\n            presence played in the conflict. For a post-conflict country\n            in a fragile, state-building process, the benefits of a\n            programmatic approach to policy operations are likely to\n            outweigh the risks, particularly the opportunity to\n            revaluate progress before each successive operation, if the\n            timing of the approval process of donors for budget support\n            is not well aligned with the government's budgetary\n            process, the program support for poverty reduction risks\n            shortfalls due to uncertainty in funding. Embedding policy\n            reforms in the Government's reform agenda instills\n            greater government ownership of the program, diminishing the\n            risk of delays or shortcomings in achieving objectives. For\n            an operation that involves coordinating actions in several\n            sectors, outside the authority of the main implementing\n            agency, the achievement of targets is more likely if\n            disaggregated into a set of measurable indicators with\n            clearly-defined administrative responsibilities in a given\n            ministry, department or agency. In a country short of\n            management capacity, a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation (M\n            and E) framework is not likely to be sustainable without\n            intensive donor inputs and supervision. Also the requirement\n            for monthly reports to be provided by the Ministry of\n            Finance may have been onerous and excessive, discouraging\n            any reporting."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic Governance\n            Reform and Growth Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic\n            Governance

and Growth\n            Credit (GRGC-2) Project will be the second in a programmatic\n            series in support of Sierra Leone's transition from\n            post-conflict recovery to sustainable development. The\n            operation supports reform measures to: (i) preserve the\n            fiscal space needed for poverty reduction; (ii) promote\n            efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of\n            public resources through enhanced public financial\n            management and governance; and (iii) improve the investment\n            climate and promote exports. The programmatic series is\n            grounded upon the government's Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy (PRS) and is consistent with the Bank's\n            2006-09 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The programmatic\n            series also builds upon a wide range of analytical work on\n            public financial management as well as sectoral policies and\n            outcomes and complements similar support provided by the\n            African Development Bank (AfDB), Department for\n            International Development (DflD), and the European\n            Commission (EC). Sierra Leone's civil war ended in\n            January 2002, just over six years ago. The United Nations\n            peacekeeping mission completed its phased withdrawal of\n            troops in December 2005, as agreed by the United Nations\n            Security Council. The United Nations, however, continues to\n            support the country through its new Integrated Office.\n            Parliamentary and presidential elections were held in August\n            2007, with a presidential run-off election in September\n            2007. The elections, judged to be free and fair, resulted in\n            a transfer of power to the former opposition party. The new\n            leadership has placed strong emphasis on a campaign against\n            corruption and more investment in physical infrastructure to\n            buttress ongoing programs in health and education. The\n            challenge now is to deepen the reform program during a\n            period of political consolidation following the 2007\n            elections, and to do so in the context of a difficult global\n            economic environment of rapidly rising fuel and food prices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Second Government Reform and\n            Growth Credit
