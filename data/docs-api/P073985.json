Some lessons learned included: there is a need\n            to be realistic when defining the GEO and to ensure good\n            monitoring and evaluation. The GEO should be closely linked\n            to the project activities, and indicators should be designed\n            so as to ensure that they serve as good monitoring tools for\n            the project activities, i.e. indicators with a solid link to\n            both the project activities and the GEO, that set clear\n            quantitative target values and that are measurable. The\n            project team and Bank management should have taken advantage\n            of the assessment carried out during the mid-term review and\n            project restructuring should have taken place, independently\n            of the workload this implies, especially for GEF projects. A\n            project supporting a broad government program, such as the\n            Santiago Urban Transport Plan (PTUS), is more difficult to\n            implement and hence more risky. Therefore, the Bank should\n            be more selective in terms of the areas to be supported,\n            limiting support to a small number of areas or activities,\n            possibly inter-related and reinforcing each another. The\n            success of the bicycle component was mainly the result of\n            the high buy-in of different levels of government and the\n            existence of a very active civil society, from which the\n            project was able to capitalize with properly timed\n            interventions and close supervision. The latter allowed for\n            the redesign of some project activities according to real needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Sustainable Transport and Air\n            Quality for Santiago (GEF)

- Sustainable Transport and Air\n            Quality for Santigo (GEF) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Sustainable Transport, and Air\n            quality for Santigo aims to help reduce greenhouse gases\n            (GHG) from ground transport in Santiago through the\n            promotion of a long-term modal shift to more efficient and\n            less polluting forms of transport, and the adoption of\n            sustainable low-GHG transport measures. The project has the\n            following four components. Component 1) will includes the\n            implementation of a three-year program of promotional\n            actions, with the overall objective of increasing bicycle\n            use in the three Comunas. Component 2) will provide\n            technical assistance for evaluating the economic and\n            environmental impact of clean technologies for buses. The\n            tests will be developed using a state of the art emissions\n            laboratory for heavy duty vehicles located at the 3 CV\n            facilities. The business structure of bus services in\n            Santiago has resulted in a costly and environmentally\n            unsustainable surface public transport system. Key issues\n            include: (a) lack of an organizational model that would\n            facilitate efficient public transport operation, (b)\n            dispersed operations that hinder the effective control of\n            bus services and contribute to traffic congestion, (c) lack\n            of professional management among bus operators, and (d) an\n            unattractive image which induces potential bus passengers to\n            use private vehicles instead. The implementation of the bus\n            routes, and more specifically of the trunk routes on\n            segregated busways is expected to allow the road-based\n            public transport system to run more efficiently with a\n            reduced number of buses. Component 3) current tools for\n            policy making rely on the use of transport models\n            inter-phased with an emission model assessing emission\n            changes due to changes in direct transport measures. 4)\n            Developing the Central Ring of Santiago (Anillo Central). It\n            was decided in agreement with the \"Mesa de Trabajo\n            Ciudad y Territorio\" that the GEF support would focus\n            its intervention through an analysis of the consistency and\n            compatibility of the various sector policies that affect\n            land-use and transport. reduce motor vehicle use within\n            Santiago's city center. This will be done trough the\n            implementation of measures such as traffic calming,\n            pedestrian facilities implementation, and parking\n            restrictions in the area of the Triangulo Central de\n            Santiago. Various studies or a multi-pronged study will be\n            necessary before defining a technically sound politically\n            viable scheme. CONAMA is preparing a project of law to\n            establish a legal and comprehensive ground for the so-called\n            Decontamination Bonds. These are economic instruments\n            designed to place a cap on emissions to the Metropolitan\n            Area of Santiago."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Sustainable Transport and Air\n
