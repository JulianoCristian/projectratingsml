The\n            project achieved some of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was substantial, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of the Bank was marginally\n            satisfactory while the Borrower's was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            closer supervision, the fielding of more missions with the\n            required skills, and closer follow-up of all project\n            components might have contributed to the better achievement\n            of project objectives. Second, if the Bank was seriously\n            interested in pursuing the objective of improving petroleum\n            supply and distribution, this seriousness would have been\n            reflected in the design and allocation of resources for the\n            project.
