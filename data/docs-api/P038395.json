As per the\n            Bank's policy (OP 13.00), due to the 18 month delay in\n            effectiveness, the Loan and Credit Agreements lapsed. The\n            approach taken by the City Council to focus on institutional\n            aspects was correct and as a result it was reflected in the\n            project design. However, the willingness to implement the\n            institutional reform waned as the socio political situation\n            in the country changed with the internal strife. Priorities\n            and political alliances shifted after the Board approval\n            which was the primary cause for the Loan and Credit\n            Agreements to lapse. Even if the operating company (OC) was\n            not included as part of the project design, without the\n            political willingness, it would be difficult to bring about\n            efficiency improvements in the water utility. Commitment\n            from the city would be required to reduce unaccounted for\n            water, increase tariffs and bill collection rates, improve\n            employee productivity etc., by not agreeing to sign the\n            Project Agreement, the City Council demonstrated that they\n            were not ready to address these difficult issues. In a\n            recent assessment made by the Government, urban poverty\n            remains as a key priority. There are about 100 slum\n            settlements in the country where citizens lack access to\n            safe drinking water and sanitation and sanitation, and\n            environmentally friendly solid waste management services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia -
