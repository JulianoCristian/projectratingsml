The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            institutional development was negligible, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of the Bank was satisfactory\n            while the Borrower's was less than satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            DEG, as presently constituted, is not competent to be\n            responsible for both project implementation and system\n            operation and maintenance. Second, the responsible authority\n            should not be subject to detailed control or interference\n            from above. Third, in return, the water authority must\n            accept responsibility for its performance in the fields of:\n            1) operation and maintenance; 2) metering, billing, and\n            collection; and 3) internal control systems and accounting\n            procedures. Finally, while substantial technical assistance\n            is still needed, it is clear from experience under this\n            project that this will be fruitless again unless accompanied\n            by a radical reshaping of institutional responsibilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Conakry Water Supply and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Conakry Water
