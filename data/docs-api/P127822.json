First and Second Development\n            Policy Loan in Support of the Plan Maroc Vert"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The First and Second Development Policy\n            Loan in Support of the Plan Maroc Vert received a moderately\n            satisfactory outcome rating with significant risk to\n            development outcome. The Bank received a satisfactory rating\n            for its performance while the Borrower received a moderately\n            satisfactory performance rating. No restructurings took\n            place during the life of this project. Country developments\n            led to three changes in the agreed prior actions for the\n            second operation. These changes were: (a) the substitution\n            of an agreement on the management model at Berkane for the\n            previously proposed action on three wholesale market pilot\n            projects. The concept remained the same but essentially the\n            target was reduced from three to one. (b) The addition of\n            the executive decision on market liberalization for red meat\n            to the proposed action on concession to the private sector\n            of modernized municipal slaughterhouses. (c) The\n            substitution of the transmission of the draft laws creating\n            the Regional Agriculture and Rural Development Offices\n            (ORDARs) for the previously proposed action raising\n            irrigation tariffs. There were several lessons learned from\n            this project including the following: (1) A development\n            policy loan (DPL) works best when it stems from a home-grown\n            reform program with strong ownership within government. (2)\n            A further strong value of Bank support under a DPL is to\n            help create a platform for agencies that otherwise may have\n            divergent agendas. (3) The linking of a DPL to a sectoral\n            medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) aligns incentives\n            for both the finance ministry and the line ministry, and\n            provides investment resources to accompany and help\n            implement reforms that otherwise might not take place or\n            might not yield their intended returns. (4) In the case of\n            Morocco, submission of draft legislation to the Government\n            General Secretary (SGG) may be inadequate assurance that a\n            reform will be promptly executed. (5) Evaluation of a DPO is\n            constrained by the short time scale, particularly for a two\n            loan series, where the final evaluation occurs only twelve\n            months after the second set of prior actions. (6) There is a\n            need \u0096 and an opportunity \u0096 to accompany some reforms with\n            project-style guidance and investment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - First and Second

The Development Policy Loan (DPL) is a key\n            component of the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)\n            (FY10-FY13). It also contributes directly to the three\n            pillars around which the World Bank's program is\n            structured: 1) growth, competitiveness, and employment; 2)\n            service delivery to citizens; and 3) sustainable development\n            in a changing climate. The program supports an ambitious\n            Government initiative in the agriculture sector and builds\n            on extensive dialogue between the World Bank and the\n            Government of Morocco (GoM) and is underpinned by a large\n            body of analytical work and sector operations. The program\n            has benefited from a broad range of analytical work recently\n            completed by the World Bank and others. The program also\n            builds on the outcomes and experience from past and ongoing\n            World Bank operations in water and irrigation, integrated\n            rural development, human
