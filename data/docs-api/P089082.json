Some lessons\n            learned included: the results framework should have been\n            based upon data available from existing monitoring systems,\n            rather than on assumed improvements to be developed during\n            the lifetime of the project and the global environmental\n            objective (GEO) indicators should have been within the scope\n            and timeframe of the project. Assessments of mandates,\n            functions, and processes, in national and local agencies - a\n            fit for partnering assessment - should have been be\n            completed during the design of the project and actions to\n            build institutional capacity to partner effectively\n            identified. Financial incentives and increased awareness can\n            bring results; for example the feedback from Laguna lake\n            development authority (LLDA) that expanding the pollutants\n            covered under the environmental user fee (through Laguna de\n            bay institutional strengthening and community participation\n            (LISCOP)) and the awareness raising (through GEF MTSP) has\n            led to reduction of pollution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
