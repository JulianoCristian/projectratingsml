The project\n            achieved most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was substantial, sustainability is uncertain,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, project objectives and implementation\n            responsibilities need to be as specific as possible. Also,\n            project design should be flexible enough to allow\n            adjustments if and when required. Second, project monitoring\n            and evaluation should critically review the work program of\n            the implementing agencies to ensure its focus on the\n            achievement of long term objectives while keeping tight\n            control over the program of work and financial performance\n            at the same time. Finally, protection and management of\n            natural forests, including resettlement of illegal settlers,\n            is a long term process of considerable socio-economic\n            complexity, requiring mutual understanding of the\n            prerogatives of the various parties involved, including\n            policy makers, implementing agencies, and the affected\n            population. In order to be sustainable, action programs have\n            to be based on negotiated terms agreed upon by all\n            stakeholders, including the private sector, and supported by\n            adequate measures to create a favorable incentive framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -
