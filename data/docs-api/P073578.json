Some lessons learned\n            included: (1) The Program, building on previously available\n            foundations, was effective to confront poverty in an\n            emergency situation. Despite the implementation issues it\n            faced, the Program did prevent beneficiaries from falling\n            into extreme poverty and successfully reached the poor. Its\n            dynamic targeting approach, through self-selection, was\n            probably more efficient to reach the poor during the crisis\n            than a static measure such as a proxy-means test. (2) During\n            times of crisis, a trade-off between orderly expansion of a\n            safety net and rapid coverage of the poor might arise. It is\n            unclear whether the decision to strengthen cash programs,\n            can result in a better crisis response that an integrated\n            strategy that relies on investments in social service\n            delivery. On the other hand, the reform of the latter may\n            take time to produce results and may thus not be a viable\n            strategy during the crisis. (2) Maintaining the nominal\n            level of the transfer is difficult politically but effective\n            to promote the transition to employment. As the economy\n            recovered and employment opportunities improved, the\n            transfer lost value and the widening gap between its level\n            and wages was an incentive for households to find other\n            income-generating activities, especially in the formal labor market."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Jefes de Hogar (Heads of\n            Household) Program

Sixth Social Protection Project\n            for Argentina) is the workfare part of a social safety net\n            launched by Argentina in April 2002 to alleviate the impact\n            of rising unemployment due to the worsening economic crisis.\n            A stipend of 150 Argentine pesos per month is provided to an\n            unemployed head of household in exchange for participation\n            in 4 hours of work in a workfare subproject. The four\n            project components include the financing of workfare\n            subprojects in community services, minor construction,\n            repair, expansion, maintenance or remodeling of schools,\n            health facilities, basic sanitation facilities, small roads\n            and bridges, culverts and canals, community kitchens and\n            centers, tourist centers, and low-cost housing. This report\n            focuses on the likely negative environmental impacts from\n            these subprojects and proposes measures to mitigate them.\n            Expected impacts to land and water include soil saturation\n            and salinization, water-borne diseases, an altering of the\n            lifestyle of affected people, surface and groundwater\n            contamination and the reduction of water quality because of\n            industrial and farm chemical use, the proliferation of algae\n            and undergrowth due to canal and waterway blockage, change\n            in the water table due to overuse, disturbance of aquatic\n            life, and erosion and sedimentation. Impacts caused by\n            constructing secondary roads in areas that receive a lot of\n            rain include flooding and erosion because of stripped\n            vegetation and inadequate drainage, and sedimentation in\n            surface waters. Road construction sites should be carefully\n            selected to avoid affecting critical forest areas and animal\n            habitats. The report recommends monitoring the nutrient\n            level of water, water discharge level, water salinity, water\n            use management, the conditions of canals and the drainage\n            system, flood controls, the presence of disease vectors,\n            erosion control, waste disposal, contaminant treatment,\n            measures to protect workers from hazardous substances,\n            waterway protections, demographic change in alluvial plains,\n            socioeconomic impacts, and institutional and technical\n            capacity of the agencies having oversight."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sexto Proyecto de Proteccion Social :\n            analisis ambiental"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina -
