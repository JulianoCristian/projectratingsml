These are among the lessons cited from this\n            project: 1) Political commitment is a strong catalyst for\n            mounting a broad-based national response to the HIV/AIDS\n            epidemic. It also influences program content. In this case,\n            the government was sensitive to the convictions of religious\n            groups and other facets of civil society, so that the\n            promotion of condoms and support to marginalized high-risk\n            groups received only modest support, and success was not\n            fully realized. 2) Even if it is provided for in project\n            design, monitoring and evaluation will not be carried out if\n            the incentives are not right. The setting of appropriate\n            targets requires knowledge of the right measures of success\n            and baseline data. 3) The failure to implement research on\n            the cost-effectiveness of various interventions is a missed\n            opportunity to learn from experience and to enhance program\n            impacts. 4) The reliable provision of relevant supplies\n            (such as condoms and drugs for treating sexually transmitted\n            diseases, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections) is\n            critical to successfully implementing HIV/AIDS programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

Sexually Transmitted Infections Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            and project sustainability is likely. Both the overall\n            performances of the World Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. Several key lessons have been learned: 1) The\n            success of an HIV/AIDS project depends very much on national\n            commitment and leadership. This project found a conducive\n            environment where the government was committed to the fight\n            against AIDS, a strong national AIDS control program, and a\n            large number of active civil society organizations already\n            involved in HIV/AIDS programs. 2) This project was\n            implemented at a time when Uganda had just embarked on an\n            ambitious decentralization agenda that sought to devolve the\n            responsibility for the planning and implementation of\n            essential public services, including health, to the district\n            administrations. Such devolution of power presents several\n            challenges for the design and implementation of\n            Bank-supported sectoral projects, that need to be recognized\n            and effectively managed, but that were significantly\n            underestimated by the project. 3) STIP was also implemented\n            at a time when various other public sector reform measures\n            were being implemented, some which had a direct impact on\n            HIV/AIDS programs. In these situations, it is critical that\n            the project requirements are appropriately harmonized with\n            other ongoing or planned public sector reform initiatives.\n            4) Capacity for public procurement of HIV/AIDS related\n            commodities needs to be assessed early and the necessary\n            agreements reached with government to ensure early\n            commencement of procurement activities. 5) Projects working\n            with multiple implementing partners, such as districts,\n            sub-district entities and community-based\n            organizations/nongovernmental organizations need to make\n            multiple advances to these implementing partners and thus\n            require a correspondingly larger Special Account. The\n            criteria for the selection of commercial banks for the\n            location of Special Accounts should also be scrutinized,\n            revised if necessary, and strictly adhered to. 6) The issue\n            of mutually agreed upon counterpart funding not forthcoming\n            has become a systemic feature of projects in Uganda, and\n            need to be equally addressed in a more systemic manner,\n            rather than on a project-by-project basis. 7) A viable and\n            effective monitoring and evaluation framework that is\n            mutually agreed upon at the time of project preparation is a\n            must for the effective implementation and evaluation of a\n            project. 8) A more targeted approach to gender-specific\n            behavior change communication; more stringent use of gender\n            disaggregated data (e.g., sexual debut, knowledge,\n            attitudes, beliefs, and practices on ways to prevent HIV) to\n            document project achievements, and enhanced support to women\n            as home based caregivers would have considerably\n            strengthened the gender dimensions of the project. 9)\n            Preventive strategies need continued support and need to be\n            better targeted to the un-reached population groups in order\n            to prevent a further stagnation of impact. 10) Finally, it\n            is clear that the single most important factor in the\n            success of Uganda was the rapid national movement from\n            denial to the acceptance of HIV as a major health and\n            socio-economic problem that needed to be confronted head-on.\n            Unfortunately, this may not be directly replicable, and,\n            therefore, the \"Uganda Model\" should not be\n            regarded as a \"silver bullet\". However, several\n            facets of Uganda's approach to AIDS control undoubtedly\n            contributed to this conversion from denial to acceptance,\n            such as the political commitment emanating from the very\n            top, the constructive collaboration between the political\n            and the religious establishments, and the active engagement\n            of civil society actors in the fight against AIDS. Looking\n            forward, these elements of Uganda's HIV strategy may\n            well be replicated in other settings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Sexually Transmitted Infections

- Sexually Transmitted Infections Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project has three main components:\n            (1) prevention of sexual transmission of Human\n            Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV) and Sexually Transmitted\n            Diseases (STDs). The project will finance awareness, mass\n            and community mobilization campaigns using Government,\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community based\n            organizations (CBOs). It will finance targeted behavioral\n            interventions and services aimed at high-risk groups through\n            NGO and CBO programs. In particular, the project will\n            finance the provision of condoms, care and treatment of\n            STDs, including drugs and training of staff; and (2)\n            mitigation of the personal impact of Acquired Immune\n            Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The project will support\n            community and home based health care and provide social\n            support for people with AIDS. This will be accomplished\n            through NGOs and CBOs at the district and community levels.\n            The project will support the orientation of staff in dealing\n            with opportunistic infections and will provide drugs for\n            these infections. Also included are the provision of\n            clinical and protective supplies. Tuberculosis is the most\n            serious HIV related infection from a public health\n            standpoint and the project will support the diagnosis and\n            case management of tuberculosis; and (3) institutional\n            development. The project will support the development of\n            district and central capacity to plan and manage STD/AIDS\n            programs. It will also support surveillance, operational\n            research and monitoring and evaluation activities. Funds\n            will also be provided for innovative NGO and CBO activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Sexually Transmitted Infections Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda -
