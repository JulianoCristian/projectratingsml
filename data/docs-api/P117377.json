A\n            comprehensive (human and animal) pandemic preparedness plan\n            will benefit from moving from a response approach using\n            emergency instruments to one that favors preventive risk\n            reduction and risk management through regular country\n            program and operations. High-risk groups can only be reached\n            through an intense communication effort. Despite a short\n            preparation period, it is important to avoid having tunnel\n            vision and think broadly when designing emergency loans. The\n            execution of projects within existing technical and\n            administrative structures has significant positive\n            externalities. A result-based financing (RBF) model is a\n            valuable strategy to influence subnational government\n            policies in federal systems. The World Bank should\n            re-evaluate the objective of the emergency recovery loan\n            instrument and its consistency with other fiduciary policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

The restructuring involves the: 1) extend\n            the project's closing date by 12 months from March 31,\n            2012, to March 31, 2013, 2) modify table one of the\n            emergency project paper; and 3) reallocate loan proceeds.\n            The restructuring will allow the project to fully achieve\n            its targets. The extension is necessary to: a) integrate the\n            pneumococcal vaccine campaign into the nation's regular\n            vaccination schedule with the purpose of achieving the\n            agreed 85 percent doses coverage; b) strengthen the capacity\n            and quality of the Health Situation Rooms (HSR) to\n            contribute to the public health intelligence system,\n            upgrading the 'certification' through a second\n            'accreditation' process; c) improve the monitoring\n            of project performance; d) strengthen the country's\n            mobile emergency and urgency system, by completing the\n            ongoing procurement process for ambulances; and e) complete\n            impact evaluation and ongoing operational research on\n            strategies for vaccination and epidemiological surveillance,\n            ensuring the project's lessons will be identified and\n            disseminated. This is the project's first extension."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Prevention and\n            Management of Influenza Type Illness and Strengthening of\n            Argentina's Epidemiological System Project :\n            restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/03/15952382/argentina-prevention-management-influenza-type-illness-strengthening-argentinas-epidemiological-system-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"AR-Prevention And Management Of Influenza\n            Type Illness And Strengt -- P117377","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Disease Control & Prevention,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Population Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20120320020702"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acute Respiratory Infections, ARI, beds,\n            burden of disease, certification, control of influenza,\n            description, disease prevention, diseases, Emergencies,\n            epidemic, epidemiological surveillance, epidemiological\n            surveillance system, EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SYSTEM, Epidemiology,\n            health care, health facilities, health sector, Health\n            Surveillance, hospitalization, hospitals, houses,\n            Immunization, Indigenous Peoples, infectious diseases,\n            INFLUENZA, influenza activity, influenza vaccine, Lab tests,\n            Ministry of Health, progress, public awareness, public\n            health, quality of care, respiratory disease, respiratory\n            illness, Rooms, treatment, vaccination, vaccination\n            campaign, vaccine, vaccines, virus"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"67426"},"14987270":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/09/14987270/argentina-prevention-management-influenza-type-illness-strengthening-argentinas-epidemiological-system-project-p117377-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-03","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/09/14987270/argentina-prevention-management-influenza-type-illness-strengthening-argentinas-epidemiological-system-project-p117377-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-03","new_url":"2011/09/14987270/argentina-prevention-management-influenza-type-illness-strengthening-argentinas-epidemiological-system-project-p117377-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-03","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-09-07T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-09-07T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b080f432b2","chronical_docm_id":"090224b080f432b2","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2011/09/07/2B5414E4CFE3336D852579040077D5FF/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P1173770ISR0Di007201101315432135618.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/LCR/2011/09/07/2B5414E4CFE3336D852579040077D5FF/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P1173770ISR0Di007201101315432135618.pdf","loan_no":"IBRD78430","datestored":"2011-09-07T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-09-07T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
