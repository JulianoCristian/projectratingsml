Frequent changes in personnel adversely\n            affected management's efficiency and effectiveness.\n            Problems identified in built facilities were caused by some\n            design and specification weaknesses which were not detected\n            by either the Federal Coordinating Unit (FCU) architect in\n            Pakistan or the architect at the Bank during project\n            development, and a lack of systematic and effective\n            supervision and quality control at critical points by the\n            Public Works Department (PWD) in the Punjab, Baluchistan and\n            North West Frontier Provinces (NWFP) during the\n            implementation of the project.
