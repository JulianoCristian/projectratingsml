The ensuing rapid and intense\n            flash flooding resulted in severe damage and 9 confirmed\n            deaths with 3 persons still missing. Additionally, there was\n            widespread damage to road infrastructure, electricity and\n            water infrastructure, housing as well as public and private\n            buildings. This report serves as a reminder and proof of the\n            Government (Go) SVG's resolve and commitment to risk\n            reduction as well as the well-being of people. The GoSVG\n            recognizes the necessity to better understand the climate\n            and disaster risk context, and do best to reduce this risk\n            and improve resilience across all sectors. On December 26,\n            2013, the GoSVG declared a national level two disaster in\n            accordance with the National Emergency and Disaster\n            Management Act, 2006. This report provides a rapid damage\n            and loss assessment of the sectors affected - with a\n            particular focus on infrastructure damage in order to inform\n            the GoSVG's recovery, reconstruction, and financial\n            planning. It also includes short and medium term\n            recommendations designed to further incorporate disaster\n            risk reduction and management into land use and physical\n            planning
