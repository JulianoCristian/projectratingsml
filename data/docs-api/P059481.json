In both components, during the construction,\n            landslides could be a threat if construction is executed in\n            a traditional method. \"Balance cut and fill,\"\n            which is an appropriate construction method for such\n            landscape, will be adopted. Cut material which may roll down\n            the slope and damage soil surface and vegetation will be\n            reduced as much as possible. Grass seeding will also be used\n            to protect the bare slopes. Traditional method of tipping\n            down spoil material can cause forest cover to turn barren\n            triggering landslides. This impact can be mitigated by using\n            log barriers to retain spoil rolling down.
