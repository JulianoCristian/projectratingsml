The project\n            includes two major components: (a) a national component to\n            assist in the institutional development of sector\n            institutions, support the implementation of new sector\n            policies, finance studies to prepare model contracting\n            documents and develop a strategy to encourage private sector\n            participation in the provision of water and sanitation\n            services, and finance the preparation of a follow-up water\n            pollution control project; and (b) a state and local\n            component to help finance sector investments which focus on\n            the poorer areas of the subproject cities. These investments\n            involve rehabilitation and expansion of water supply and\n            sanitation systems.
