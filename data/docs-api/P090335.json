Adequate resources should\n            be allocated for such upstream knowledge support and to\n            mobilize experts with practical experience to provide\n            guidance to the client. The inclusion of 19 pilot cities\n            made the project too complex, despite all cities being\n            motivated initially. With fewer cities, issues faced by\n            cities lagging behind could have been addressed more\n            quickly. If it is desired to involve more cities for\n            demonstration purposes, separate projects of 3 to 5 cities\n            each could be packaged appropriately."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
