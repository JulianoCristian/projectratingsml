This wil be achieved through four project\n            components. Component 1 improves teaching and learning by\n            financing school-based professional development for\n            teachers, providing career development opportunities;\n            upgrading basic education conditions in schools, and\n            ensuring access of rural students to basic teaching-learning\n            materials. Component 2 improves school-community\n            partnerships by setting up a school-community grants\n            program. Component 3 strengthens the analytic capacity of\n            the Ministry of Education and Research (MER) at national and\n            local levels for policy analysis and formulation, as well as\n            for planning and evaluation.

To maintain aesthetics and protect the\n            landscape and prevent debris from being dumped into water\n            bodies, clean the building site and dispose of all debris\n            and waste materials in accordance with clauses specified in\n            the bills of quantities.

Finally, to prevent any\n            health implications to populations, there will be specially\n            designed systems for handling and disposing of hazardous\n            wastes like
