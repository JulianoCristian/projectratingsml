Some lessons learned included: improving\n            mobility and accessibility for the poor through bus rapid\n            transit systems requires integrating the main corridor\n            effectively with feeder services and other public transport\n            system that reach close to the traveler\u2019s origins and\n            destinations. Realistic scenarios and sound risk allocation\n            are crucial for public-private partnerships if high service\n            standards are to be maintained and the use of the assets\n            providing the service is to be maximized. Given the complex\n            urban settings in which rapid urban transport systems are\n            typically situated, it is important to inform and consult\n            with all categories of project affected persons, to\n            anticipate and take effective measures to prevent possible\n            negative environmental and social impacts and related\n            disputes. A shift towards non-motorized transport can be\n            expected to take a long time even with enabling and\n            supporting factors and facilities in place."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -

Lima Urban Transport Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"On October 1, 2009, the Inspection Panel\n            received a request for inspection related to the Peru: Lima\n            Urban Transport Project. The request was submitted by\n            residents of the District of Barranco within the Lima\n            Metropolitan area, who claim they are suffering and will\n            suffer harm as a result of the ?deficiencies and omissions\n            of the World Bank in the design and implementation of the\n            project as it relates specifically to Barranco. The project\n            supports the construction of a bus rapid-transit system\n            (BRT) through the city of Lima. The project includes a bus\n            corridor in Barranco, a coastal district located in the\n            south-east of Lima between the relatively wealthier\n            Miraflores district and the relatively low-income Chorillos\n            district, where the bus route ends. Barranco was designated\n            a historical district by the National Institute of Culture\n            in 1972. In the Requesters'view, the permanent\n            rerouting of traffic, caused by the project, has severely\n            affected traffic in Barranco, leading to health and safety\n            concerns, deterioration in the conservation of the historic\n            area of Barranco and adverse social and economic impacts. In\n            particular, they state that the traffic that was re-routed\n            from Avenida Bolognesi is posing great danger to the\n            district's historical and ?monumental heritage and\n            deteriorating its quality of life because of very high\n            volume of traffic and pollution. The panel notes that,\n            independently of the project, there have been significant\n            increases in traffic volumes in recent years both in Lima as\n            a whole and in Barranco in particular. In the Panel's\n            view, the significant and poorly managed changes in traffic\n            in Barranco as a result of the project, superimposed on the\n            construction work associated with the BRT and the general\n            changes in the urban character of Barranco described above,\n            have caused deterioration in the quality of life of many\n            residents of Barranco and posed a threat to the\n            district's historical character. In addition, the poor\n            quality of some of the project work along the Avenida\n            Bolognesi in Barranco, such as pavements and pedestrian\n            crossings, as well as delays in the construction process,\n            have added to the hazards, aggravation, inconvenience and\n            frustration suffered by the residents of Barranco. These\n            harms cannot, in fairness, be solely attributable to the\n            Project, and some of them may be reduced as the BRT enters a\n            fully operational stage. Nevertheless, they are significant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Lima Urban Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Lima Urban Transport Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/01/13630682/peru-lima-urban-transport-project","projn":"PE-Lima Transport Project -- P035740","docty":"Investigation Report","subtopic":"Urban Transport,Transport in Urban Areas,Airports and Air Services,Housing & Human Habitats,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Transport,Urban Development","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20110121022736"},"subsc":"General transportation sector,Sub-national government administration,Other social services","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Transport,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility, accidents, air, air quality,\n            architectural heritage, barrier effect, Bus, bus corridor,\n            bus lanes, bus route, bus services, bus station, bus\n            stations, bus stops, bus system, buses, car, cars,\n            certification, cities, communities, Community Participation,\n            commuting, construction, construction and operation,\n            construction phase, construction process, Construction\n            Supervision, construction work, construction works,\n            Description, disabilities, districts, diversion of traffic,\n            environmental benefits, environmental impacts, feeder\n            services, handling, high quality public transport, high\n            traffic volume, highway, Historic District, historic\n            neighborhood, historical sites, homes, houses,\n            Infrastructure Projects, inhabitants, Inspection,\n            intersections, lanes, living conditions, local streets, mass\n            rapid transit, mass rapid transport, metro systems, Ministry\n            of Transport, Ministry of Transportation, mixed use,\n            mobility, mode of transportation, neighborhoods, noise,\n            passengers, pedestrian, pedestrian crossing, pedestrian\n            crossings, pedestrian environment, pedestrian movement,\n            pedestrian safety, Pedestrian traffic, pedestrians,\n            pollution, poor neighborhoods, population density, private\n            vehicles, public transport, public transport sector, public\n            transport system, public transportation, radar, rail, rail\n            transit, range, Rapid Traffic Growth, Rapid Transit, Rapid\n            Transit system, Rapid Transit Systems, rapid transport,\n            reduction in traffic, Reference, resettlement, residential\n            areas, restoration, right of way, road, road corridors, road\n            safety, roads, routes, routing, safeguard policies, safety,\n            safety concerns, Sidewalks, streets, tourists, traffic,\n            Traffic Congestion, traffic flow, traffic flows, traffic\n            light, traffic management, traffic management measures,\n            traffic patterns, traffic problems, traffic safety, traffic\n            signals, traffic study, traffic volumes, transfer terminals,\n            transit stations, transit system, transport conditions,\n            transport management, transport sector, transport system,\n            transportation, transportation management, trips, trust\n            funds, tunnel, Urban Transport, Urban Transport Project,\n            urban transportation, vehicle, vehicles, vehicular traffic,\n            volume of traffic"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF025503-PHRD-LIMA URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT,TF029535-PHRD-LIMA URBAN TRANSPORT PROJ.,TF030314-DANISH CTF GENERAL FY03 -
