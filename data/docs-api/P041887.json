The risk\n            to development outcome was moderate.  Bank performance was\n            rated as moderately satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was satisfactory.  The lessons learned are as follows: (1)\n            Allow sufficient time for a new institution to be\n            established, especially when it accompanies a major policy\n            reform. (2) The MDF model in supporting ULB infrastructure\n            investments was effective and should be continued with\n            stronger technical support. (3) Introducing a municipal fund\n            where there are small cities with weak financial systems\n            requires realistic eligibility criteria for participating\n            municipalities and ample institutional capacity building to\n            allow them to participate and sustain their investments. (4)\n            Closer coordination between BMDF and LGED in providing\n            institutional strengthening and technical support would\n            strengthen BMDF operations. (5) The MSU was an effective\n            vehicle for delivering and coordinating technical and\n            institutional support to municipalities assisted by the\n            World Bank and other donors. (6) Including a disaster risk\n            management (or contingent emergency response) component in\n            projects where there is a high risk of flooding and other\n            natural disasters facilitates an emergency response.

The additional credit will\n            help finance the scaling up of improvements in urban\n            infrastructure and the municipal financial and management\n            capacity. The project has so far financed the rehabilitation\n            or construction of urban infrastructure in about 130\n            municipalities (and the repair and rehabilitation of\n            flood-damaged infrastructure in 195 towns), as well as a\n            capacity strengthening program of 92 municipalities. These\n            activities have been carried out well and resulted in\n            significant benefits as well as strong demand for additional\n            support. The additional credit will help extend the partial\n            financing of urban infrastructure improvements to some 170\n            towns, ' and extend the municipal capacity\n            strengthening program to about 142 municipalities, out of\n            315 urban local bodies (ULBs) of Bangladesh. Further, the\n            additional financing will support the development of a next\n            generation of urban improvement programs. The additional\n            financing will be the second one to help scale up the core\n            components of the project. In recognition of the good early\n            implementation record under the project, an additional\n            financing of $25 million was approved in 2008 to help\n            rehabilitate the damages to urban infrastructure as a part\n            of the Emergency 2007 Flood Restoration and Recovery\n            Assistance Program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -

The restructuring of\n            above-referenced projects, including the additional\n            financing, will form part of the larger IDA support package\n            for 2007 FRRAP, which also includes funding embedded in the\n            ongoing projects mentioned above and two other credits\n            (Health, Nutrition and Population Sector Program, Cr.4052,\n            and Primary Education Program 11, Cr 3857. The credit\n            closing dates of three Credits (Cr. 3177, Cr. 3791 and Cr.\n            3740) will be extended to June 30, 2011. The Emergency 2007\n            FRRAP consists of two components: (A) infrastructure\n            rehabilitation covering (i) rehabilitation of secondary,\n            regional, and rural roads, (ii) reconstruction of bridges\n            and culverts (iii) rehabilitation of urban roads, bridges\n            and culverts, and drainage facilities in municipalities,\n            (iv) rehabilitation of health facilities, (v) rehabilitation\n            of flood embankments, flood control and drainage, and\n            irrigation schemes, (vi) rehabilitation of water supply and\n            sanitation facilities, and (B) livelihood restoration\n            through low interest loans and community projects. The flood\n            restoration works will support sectors where the Bank is\n            currently financing regular investments. Concerned\n            Government of Bangladesh (GOB) line ministries and\n            departments will be accountable for their respective\n            infrastructure rehabilitation within the framework of\n            ongoing projects. This ensures overall rapid and effective\n            implementation without major amendments to each project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Emergency 2007 Flood\n            Restoration
