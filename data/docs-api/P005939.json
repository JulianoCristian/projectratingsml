The project is the Bank's\n            first endeavor to assist in the evaluation of coal reserves\n            in Argentina. The project provided the government with a\n            basic coal reserves inventory, thus enabling it to establish\n            investment priorities, define policies for the long-term\n            development of the Argentinian energy sector, and strengthen\n            the technical capabilities of YCF. This report reviews the\n            implementation of the project based upon the data from\n            project documents and files at the Bank. The evaluation of\n            coal resources improved and strengthened the sector\n            knowledge. The project provided the starting point for\n            dialogue with the Secretariat of Energy on coal as a\n            supplement to other energy sources. The project resulted in\n            a more accurate assessment of the coal resources of the\n            Austral Basin of southern Argentina while providing\n            equipment and training to strengthen YCF. From a technical\n            point of view, the project was successful."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Coal Exploration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Coal Exploration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/06/742125/argentina-coal-exploration-project","projn":"AR-Coal Exploration-269664 -- P005939","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy,Industry","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925065830"},"subsc":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy,Industry","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Coal,coal development,Coal Exploration,coal\n            mine,coal prices,coal production,coal reserves,Coal\n            resources,COAL SEAM,commercial banks,consumption\n            expenditures,debt,drilling,drilling rigs,economic\n            conditions,energy policies,Energy policy,energy\n            resources,energy sources,engineering,engineering\n            design,exchange rate,exploitation,exploration\n            activities,exploration efforts,Exploration\n            Licenses,flexibility,fuel,fuel oil,fuels,Gas,Gas\n            Company,geology,heat,heating,inflation,legislation,lignite,logging,measurements,mine\n            development,mine operation,mineral\n            deposit,mismanagement,Natural Gas,natural resources,Nuclear\n            Energy,Oil,Oil Company,Petroleum,pipeline,power\n            generation,pressure,public notice,resource\n            base,sandstone,sediments,signs,solid fuels,steam\n            coal,sustainable growth,transport,trenching,uranium,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"Coal,coal development,Coal Exploration,coal\n            mine,coal prices,coal production,coal reserves,Coal\n            resources,COAL SEAM,commercial banks,consumption\n            expenditures,debt,drilling,drilling rigs,economic\n            conditions,energy policies,Energy policy,energy\n            resources,energy sources,engineering,engineering\n            design,exchange rate,exploitation,exploration\n            activities,exploration efforts,Exploration\n            Licenses,flexibility,fuel,fuel oil,fuels,Gas,Gas\n            Company,geology,heat,heating,inflation,legislation,lignite,logging,measurements,mine\n            development,mine operation,mineral\n            deposit,mismanagement,Natural Gas,natural resources,Nuclear\n            Energy,Oil,Oil Company,Petroleum,pipeline,power\n            generation,pressure,public notice,resource\n            base,sandstone,sediments,signs,solid fuels,steam\n            coal,sustainable growth,transport,trenching,uranium,wages"}},"owner":"WB Off:Buenos Aires-Southrn Cone (LCC7C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"7909"},"723599":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/11/723599/argentina-coal-exploration-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1980/11/723599/argentina-coal-exploration-project","new_url":"1980/11/723599/argentina-coal-exploration-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/08/23/000178830_98101902355576/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/08/23/000178830_98101902355576/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"S020","docdt":"1980-11-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2000-08-23T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Coal Exploration Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project would evaluate coal reserves\n            in the most promising area of the Austral basin.
