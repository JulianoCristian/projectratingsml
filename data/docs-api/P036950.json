The following are some of the lessons learned: 1)\n            With more than half of China's absolute poor living\n            outside the 592 nationally designated counties, targeting\n            social services delivery projects at the poor township level\n            would more effectively include larger percentages of the\n            absolute poor. However, the counties should be given chief\n            administrative responsibility for such projects since\n            townships lack the administrative capacity to manage such\n            poverty targeted projects. 2) Policy changes and\n            institutionalization of programs, such as student assistance\n            programs, can be realized when the appropriate survey work\n            is conducted and pilot programs are developed and tested,\n            based on survey work. 3) Limited use of library books and\n            teaching equipment is a problem; librarians and teachers\n            must be released from personal responsibility for the books\n            and equipment if full use of these materials is to be\n            realized. 4) Project management training can contribute to\n            institutionalizing a system of management when such training\n            is conducted over the life of a project. 5) The key issue in\n            developing education projects at the provincial, county, and\n            township level is to convince the Chinese preparation teams\n            that focusing on development outcomes is more important than\n            emphasizing investment inputs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Third Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Third Basic Education

The project will support the government's\n            efforts to make primary education universal by the year 2000\n            by putting more educational inputs into teaching points,\n            increasing the enrollment in complete schools, expanding\n            multigrade and multisubject teaching in rural areas, and\n            reducing dropouts rates of minority children through\n            improved bilingual educational programs. The project\n            consists of the following components: 1) an institutional\n            component comprising: (a) facilities upgrading; (b)\n            instructional equipment, furniture and

(c) expansion of education\n            management information system; and 3) a central component\n            consisting of: (a) national training; (b) research\n            dissemination program;
