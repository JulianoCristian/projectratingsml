Ratings for the Third Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit for Senegal are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated as\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            The PRSCs had a clear impact on Government ownership of the\n            reform program. The PRSCs helped the reformers within the\n            ministries to mobilize the entire Government on\n            cross-cutting issues and encouraged the Government to\n            provide leadership and accountability. Subsequently, the\n            strengthened alignment and predictability of support through\n            the PRSCs have begun to lead to improved decision making by\n            the Government at various levels. This momentum has to be\n            maintained and strengthened in two ways. One, the Bank\n            should reinforce this instrument and confirm its confidence\n            in the country-based model by gradually increasing the share\n            of the budget support in the global portfolio. Two, the Bank\n            has to take the lead in facilitating coordination among\n            donors in order to reassure those countries that hesitate to\n            move toward budget support. 2) The PRSC instrument can be an\n            efficient instrument for reinforcing the Government's\n            monitoring and evaluation system. 3) Budgetary support\n            through an instrument such as a PRSC is an effective tool to\n            address cross-cutting constraints and issues that affect\n            service delivery, notably in health and education -- that\n            cannot be effectively addressed at the sector level or\n            through investment operations only. 4) An institutional\n            anchor is important and necessary to ensure that specific\n            needs are incorporated into budgetary discussions; this is\n            particularly true for issues such as decentralization or the\n            protection of vulnerable groups that involve multiple\n            Ministries and agencies. Conversely, those areas that do not\n            have such an anchor lack an advocate in the budget process\n            and consequently may not receive adequate funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal
