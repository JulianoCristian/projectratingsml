Theses\n            were the lessons learned concerning Bank support to\n            expansion of primary education: 1) Very rapid expansion of\n            enrollments, even with appropriate increase in funding, is\n            liable to disrupt efforts to improve the efficiency and\n            effectiveness of systems for delivering inputs to schools\n            and for monitoring the quality of learning processes and\n            outputs. Thorough diagnosis is needed of the weaknesses in\n            these systems and of the time. needed to rectify them, to\n            determine absorptive capacity. Attention should be given to\n            prioritization and sequencing, to avoid overloading the\n            reform agenda.  2) To protect the quality of education while\n            expanding the capacity of the system, project design should\n            be based on analysis of existing strengths and weaknesses at\n            the school and classroom levels, providing a baseline for\n            monitoring relevant indicators.  3) \"Big bang\"\n            expansion of primary enrollments has long-term downstream\n            fiscal implications beyond just the primary sub-sector.\n            Uganda is confronting the need to increase capital and\n            recurrent funding to post-primary education, now that pupils\n            in the universal primary education (UPE) bulge are\n            completing the primary cycle. Growth in the number of\n            teachers has become a major issue for the public service\n            payroll as a whole and is inhibiting pay reform. Lessons\n            concerning use of adjustment lending through a sector-wide\n            approach (SWAP) for education include the following: 1) The\n            combination of budget support and investment lending can be\n            an effective form of Bank support to expand primary\n            education in countries with commitment to good policies but\n            weak capacity to implement them. The two projects were\n            mutually supportive. 2) Given strong ministry leadership, a\n            SWAP can be quickly established, with benefits for the\n            coherence of sector strategy, the quality and national\n            ownership of sector policies, and transparency of sector\n            planning and budget processes, but it presents new issues\n            for aid management.  3) Maintaining donor and public\n            confidence depends on special measures for fiduciary\n            assurance which can be difficult to sustain."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

institutional\n            impacts. Lessons of general application indicate that the\n            prolonged use of donor-financed consultants, or long-term\n            technical assistants, tend to endanger capacity building,\n            lowering the likelihood of sustainability. It is thus\n            stipulated that the use of a Project Implementation Unit\n            structure - whether or not its staff are civil servants -\n            does prevent the accumulated experience of being transferred\n            to other line units. And, had the Teacher Development and\n            Management System, as well as the instructional materials\n            component incorporated periodic evaluations, a better\n            targeted instructional quality would have been achieved,\n            namely, the curriculum reform, examination, and other\n            programs. Lessons of sector application vary, from the\n            possibility to attain universal primary education by\n            streamlining complex programs, to the need to maintain a\n            focus on desired outcomes, critical for increased\n            educational quality. Additionally, centralized materials\n            procurement is perceived as unpractical in Uganda, given\n            inadequacies in transportation, and management systems.\n            Other issues address the importance to strike a balance\n            between quantitative and qualitative indicators to guide\n            policy matters; to improve linkages among training, teacher\n            practices, and learning achievement; of shared ownership;\n            and, of assessment systems to help teachers in the daily\n            particulars of student
