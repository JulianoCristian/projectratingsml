Some lessons learned included: while SIF has\n            been considering ways to reduce its administrative costs, it\n            is vital to find a proper measure of administrative\n            efficiency that does not discourage the institution from\n            undertaking innovative projects, attempting more complex\n            interventions, emphasizing social participation in\n            subprojects, and devoting the resources necessary to ensure\n            the quality and sustainability of the project; SIF's\n            information system, adapted from the ESF, was not, in\n            hindsight, the most appropriate type of system for the SIF,\n            nor was it able to successfully expand to keep pace with\n            SIF's type or level of investment; it is vital to\n            ensure that the accounting and information systems have the\n            capacity to expand to meet projected investment levels, to\n            provide extensive training in the use of the systems, and to\n            regularly review the performance of the systems and make\n            adjustments accordingly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Social Investment Fund
