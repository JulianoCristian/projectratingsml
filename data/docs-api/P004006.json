Lessons drawn from the project\n            suggest that sustained road management should be supported\n            within adequate technical assistance, including training,\n            and advisory services, as well as performance monitoring, to\n            provide effective implementation. Likewise, sustainable\n            financing mechanisms should be in place to ensure adequate\n            funding for road preservation, hence, disbursement of funds\n            warrants special attention. However, technical assistance by\n            itself, has a limited impact on local capacity building,\n            unless it is accompanied by proper civil service reforms;\n            thus, the role of monitoring, and the linkage between\n            performance, and access to central allocations of resources,\n            is crucial to establishing the importance of strong local\n            capacity. Furthermore, much of the slow improvements in\n            network conditions, and inadequacy of funding are related to\n            prevailing poor construction quality, and inappropriate\n            technology, which require credit access for: improved\n            equipment; multi-year contracts for pavement works to\n            encourage larger contractors at lower work-prices; and,\n            appropriate alternative construction technologies. Though\n            planning, programming, and monitoring practices proved\n            sound, independent management, and performance monitoring\n            should continue under the new decentralization process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
