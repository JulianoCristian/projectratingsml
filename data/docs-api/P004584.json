The lessons specify that although quick\n            Build-Operate-Transfer operations in the power sector, may\n            be crucial to alleviate power shortages, prudential\n            investment, and financial planning, as well as risk\n            management should be considered to attain a cohesive\n            sectoral approach, within a competitive, price\n            rationalization framework. Only in the first few years of\n            operation, were there any economic benefits, because power\n            was scarce, and the value of avoiding outages, was high;\n            thus, the quantification of benefits, and estimates of the\n            economic rate of return, was critically dependent on the\n            estimated value of \"unserved\" energy, in contrast\n            to the conventional economic rate of return analysis.\n            Furthermore, the use of a \"rate of return on\n            assets\" target for financial performance, is\n            inappropriate for a company, or sector with vast, and\n            uncertain investment programs. The report re-emphasizes the\n            importance to maintain staff continuity, particularly in\n            complex operations, and avoid multiple implementing\n            agencies, given the potential for diversity performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
