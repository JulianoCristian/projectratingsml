Some lessons learned included: key to the\n            development policy loans (DPL's) success is the fact\n            that the request for development policy credit (DPC) support\n            was initiated by the government without any prodding by the\n            Bank. This was made easier by the fact that the minister of\n            finance had prior experience in both the World Bank and the\n            Nigerian debt management office. The strong government\n            leadership and buy-in to the program at the time it was\n            being prepared was key to its success. The Bank's high\n            quality analytical work and numerous dissemination events\n            helped to build the Bank's credibility in the financial\n            sector, strengthen the relationship with the Central Bank of\n            Nigeria (CBN), and provided a road map for reform of the\n            banking sector and improvements in public financial\n            management. The DPC components focused on financial sector\n            reform cannot have been implemented without the reformist\n            governor of the CBN and the federal minister of finance.\n            These key reform champions communicated their own reform\n            program without much visible support from the World Bank.\n            Having all the reform messages come from respected Nigerian\n            leadership rather than from Bank staff was vital for the\n            success of the program in the complex Nigerian political\n            economy context. Having the task members based in one place\n            helped to develop a sense of teamwork and also allowed the\n            team to have day-to-day discussions with government counterparts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Financial Sector and Public\n            Financial Management Development Policy Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Financial

With the financial\n            crisis, the drop in oil prices and consequently in\n            government revenues, the Nigerian economy started\n            experiencing tremendous pressure. Economic Reform and\n            Governance Project helped the government arrest the slide in\n            market confidence, support economic reforms, and address key\n            financial transparency issues that will buffer the country\n            from future shocks. The project provided budgetary support\n            to the Nigerian government to offset the fiscal impact of\n            the global financial crisis and also supported the\n            government in maintaining its economic reform path in the\n            financial sector, fiscal policy, management and governance.\n            The improvements in public financial management let everyone\n            benefit from improved transparency and better use of public resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Accelerating economic reforms and\n            mitigating the impact of the global economic

(DPC) Program for Nigeria are: (i) maintaining\n            confidence and stability in the financial system; (ii)\n            strengthening the banking system; and (iii) supporting the\n            objectives of the 2009 budget focused on raising Government\n            investment spending to accelerate non-oil growth. The DPC\n            will support the Government's efforts to maintain its\n            current reform path and limit the crisis impact on the\n            non-oil economy. The policy actions supported by the credit\n            aim at sustaining a stable and sound financial sector,\n            maintaining sound management of oil revenues, refocusing\n            budgetary expenditures on investments addressing growth\n            bottlenecks for the economy, and continuing reform efforts\n            in the area of public financial management. In particular,\n            the monetary authorities have taken aggressive measures to\n            provide sufficient liquidity to the banking system, and\n            advanced measures to tighten bank oversight as part of a\n            medium-term financial sector reform program. The Government\n            has approved a 2009 budget that uses a conservative oil\n            price, reprioritizes spending toward capital outlays, and\n            taken measures to accelerate execution of capital spending.\n            At the same time, reforms continue in improving transparency\n            and accountability, and ensuring value for money in\n            procurement. Going forward the credit identifies a set of\n            medium term actions required to support implementation of\n            the identified structural reforms. These relate to both\n            strengthening the financial sector, macroeconomic management\n            and public financial management and procurement. These\n            actions discuss and endorsed by the authorities-lend\n            themselves to monitoring. Their realization will be crucial\n            to maintaining the momentum for reform supported by this\n            credit and to achieving the envisaged structural outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
