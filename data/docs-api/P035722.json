The lessons\n            learned indicate that one negative element in the\n            implementation of this operation in particular, and in all\n            projects with external financing in the Dominican Republic,\n            is the delay in the date of project effectiveness, due to\n            the extremely slow process in Congress to ratify the loan\n            agreements. Some project components require modifications\n            that by far cannot be financed by the loan, those changes\n            should be carefully considered before authorizing them under\n            the project, even if the past experience in the country,\n            concerning payment with local funds of the modifications, is\n            positive With respect to Routine Maintenance by Contract,\n            the lesson of the Project is that big and medium size\n            contractors are not interested in routine maintenance\n            contracts. Lack of counterpart funds is an endemic problem\n            in the DR and many other countries. Maintenance Financing\n            and Management - compliance with covenants that requires\n            approval of Congress or similar institutions is difficult to\n            achieve and should be replaced by covenants more modest in\n            scope, but easier to comply with and/or specific conditions\n            for appraisal. The discrepancy on the initial pilot highway\n            concession project between the Secretariat of State of\n            Public Works and Communications (SEOPC) (favorable to the\n            concession) and the Office of Supervision of State Works\n            (OSOE) and some presidential advisors (opposed to the\n            concession) led to the cancellation of the concession\n            contract after its awarding and signature and even its\n            approval by Congress. Throughout most of the project\n            implementation period, the composition of the Bank\n            supervision team remained relatively unchanged, with the\n            same task manager during the entire life of the Project.\n            Maintaining continuity was an important factor in enabling\n            the Bank to build relationships with the Borrower over the long-term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - National Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominican Republic - National\n            Highway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/04/3324797/dominican-republic-national-highway-project","projn":"DO-National Hwy.
