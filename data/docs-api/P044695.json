Lessons learned include: the NAADS\n            Project was the first in Africa to incorporate public\n            funding and pluralistic provision of services as a national\n            program, with farmers empowered to select their service\n            providers. Prior to introduction of the NAADS Program,\n            questions were raised as to whether such a program shown to\n            work elsewhere, particularly in Latin America, will be\n            suitable and feasible in Africa. The NAADS experience offers\n            many lessons about how best to adapt such a model, but a\n            fundamental conclusion can be drawn that the programs are\n            suitable and superior to the centralized traditional model\n            of public funding and public provision of services. The fact\n            that the Government of Uganda (GOU) saw NAADS as a public\n            program, rather than an enclave project of the donors, gave\n            the program weight and an opportunity to be transformative,\n            through scale and mainstreaming into governmental systems.\n            Few countries have the equivalent of the NAADS Act to\n            safeguard design of programs. This can be a very\n            constructive measure when programs require long duration to\n            reach impact, but governments and priorities may change\n            frequently. Advisory services appear to have had a greater\n            impact than subsidized provision of inputs under the\n            program. This finding is very provisional and warrants more\n            careful investigation, since it is critical to policy\n            dialogue in African agriculture at present. Many governments\n            are of the view that widespread distribution of subsidized\n            fertilizer will achieve rapid gains in productivity and\n            incomes. The NAADS experience suggests that the most\n            impressive gains were achieved in the period when the\n            program concentrated on provision of advice and\n            demonstration of technologies. The returns when inputs\n            became relatively more important in the program appear to be\n            more mixed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - National Agricultural Advisory\n
