Some lessons\n            learned included: investment in capacity building at all\n            levels is essential for localizing development and promoting\n            local governance. Commitment to reforms and strong political\n            will to decentralization is fundamental to projects that\n            seek to support its implementation. It is not enough to just\n            transfer management of resources to beneficiaries, strong\n            oversight is needed to guard against elite capture,\n            political hijacking or deviation from the bottom up\n            approach. The project coverage was ambitious, even though\n            this was meant to extend the coverage of the benefit to many\n            communities as possible, may result in lower per capita\n            benefit. Also, there are many unmet needs in the approved\n            Strategic Development Plan (SDP) which could have led to\n            greater impact in case the project will have covered less\n            villages and wards.
