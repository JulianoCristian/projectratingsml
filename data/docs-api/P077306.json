Some lessons\n            learned includes: substantial enhancement of tax\n            administration effectiveness requires fundamental\n            organizational change. Revenue targets could be an\n            unsuitable performance outcome indicator for revenue\n            administration reform projects. Tax policy and other legal\n            reforms must be identified and prepared in advance of\n            project implementation if expected increases in tax\n            administration effectiveness and tax collection are to be\n            achieved. A broader and continued policy dialogue on tax\n            reform is needed in parallel to increase likelihood of\n            success of revenue administration reforms. The continuity of\n            the Bank's task team, with the right mix of technical\n            skills and Bank operational experience, is a necessary\n            condition for successful supervision of revenue\n            administration projects. Stand-alone investment loans may\n            not be the most appropriate instrument for supporting major\n            tax reform. To increase likelihood of tax reform success, a\n            thorough and systematic political economy analysis (PEA)\n            should not only be seen as a desirable feature, but rather\n            as a key component of project design and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Tax Administration Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Tax Administration\n
