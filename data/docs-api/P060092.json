The\n            credit had the potential to be an effective instrument in an\n            emergency, post-conflict situation, for improving the\n            provision of government services, stimulating private sector\n            development, and generally enhancing the prospects for\n            national reconciliation. When faced with a strong\n            political/reputational pressure to move in a difficult and\n            poor security environment, the Bank should also consider the\n            effectiveness and sustainability of its budgetary\n            assistance, both factors bearing higher reputational risks\n            in the medium to long term. The right approach is to state\n            clearly that the Bank has endorsed the Low-Income Countries\n            Under Stress (LICUS) principles, and it is committed to stay\n            engaged even in most difficult circumstances. However, for\n            budgetary support, four factors should be taken into\n            account: (i) a sound macroeconomic framework should be in\n            place; (ii) there should be some prior investment in\n            knowledge so as to design a relevant and realistic reform\n            program; (iii) Bank support should be part of a broader\n            international assistance package, with most donors endorsing\n            a common platform; (iv) a candid assessment of the internal\n            process in place to address unrest, including the quality of\n            the national dialogue and reconciliation efforts, should be\n            undertaken. For a country like Central African Republic\n            (CAR) emerging from a devastating conflict, with disruptions\n            in administrative capacity and a distressed economy, the\n            capacity to raise domestic revenue is most likely limited in\n            the short-term, and therefore balance of payments support is\n            needed. Preparation of relevant and good quality Economic\n            and Sector Work (ESW) and policy notes is a critical\n            prerequisite for a meaningful policy dialogue with the\n            government and preparation of loans/credits. Privatization\n            of public enterprises and utilities involves complicated\n            processes and requires careful sequencing. For LICUS-type\n            countries such CAR, the focus of the Bank assistance should\n            be on building capacity in the government to implement\n            reforms and improve delivery of services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Fiscal\n            Consolidation Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Central African Republic - Fiscal\n

post-conflict. The project\n            will help the Government achieve its basic functions -\n            particularly regularize payment of salaries to civil\n            servants and the military - while enhancing the prospects\n            for peace in a still fragile post-conflict environment.\n            Furthermore, the external debt will be serviced, improving\n            external credibility, thus inducing external assistance to\n            foster private investments, and achieve the required\n            development growth. However, political instability risks a\n            still fragile peace, which could be riskier without the\n            budget support provided by this operation, and the Fund for\n            Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF). A further\n            risk is the resistance to change, and opposition from vested\n            interests - including revenue agencies - although, actions\n            taken recently by the Government, namely lowering of cotton\n            prices, have provided credible signals of sustained support\n            from the International Development Agency (IDA), hence,\n            reducing the risk of backtracking.
