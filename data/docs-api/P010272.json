The\n            project achieved most of its specific objectives, its impact\n            on institutional development was partially successful,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, for future TA projects,\n            the Bank's monitoring and progress report requirements\n            should be simplified and made less time consuming. Second,\n            in order to avoid duplication of the effort involved in the\n            selection of consultants and to enable the sub-projects to\n            contribute to the development of the Government's\n            structural reform program in a more effective and timely\n            manner, a simplified set of procedures needs to be\n            developed. Third, if the Bank is to be involved with the\n            functioning of a future technical assistance project,\n            additional staff weeks should be devoted to field\n            supervision of the TA credit. Fourth, effective control of\n            any such future general purpose TA credits should be\n            centralized in the agency responsible for policy planning in\n            the Government and the Project Director of the TAPC should\n            be given greater authority to decide on certain matters.\n            Fifth, for each sub-project, one organization should be\n            asked to take primary technical and administrative\n            responsibility for the product. Finally, it may be desirable\n            to modify the design of future TA projects and restrict\n            their scope to only policy and reform issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Third Technical Assistance Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Third Technical\n            Assistance Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/03/732162/pakistan-third-technical-assistance-credit-project","projn":"PK-Tech.
