One key lesson is\n            that, in rapidly changing, post-conflict, transitional\n            economies, a flexible approach to design of components is\n            necessary. At appraisal, the forest restoration component\n            was directed at state forest lands. However, as the project\n            progressed, assistance in restoring private forest lands and\n            characteristic Adriatic olive trees proved more successful,\n            so the project shifted its focus to this activity during the\n            last few years. Similarly, the fire management component was\n            re-oriented, with a greater focus on community involvement\n            and fire-resistant silvi-cultural techniques. This\n            flexibility to change circumstances, while maintaining\n            consistency with project objectives, helped achieve\n            successful outcomes. The project was a model for the region\n            in terms of encouraging policy reform, development of\n            standards, and institutional restructuring. The\n            participatory approach Croatia undertook to prepare its\n            forest policy and strategy and forest standards was a\n            best-practice example. The restructuring study financed\n            under the project was strongly supported by Government, but\n            only halfheartedly embraced by HS (the implementing agency).\n            As a result, the restructuring study was less influential\n            than it could have been, and opportunities for the project\n            to support implementation of the restructuring study were\n            lost. Future projects that support restructuring programs\n            must have strong stakeholder agreement, especially from the\n            institution undergoing reform. In order to ensure that\n            project objectives are embraced by the implementing agency,\n            the project implementation unit should be fully integrated\n            into the agency. If possible, the PIU should be staffed with\n            full-time workers, appointed by the implementing agency to\n            manage and carry out project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -

and\n            protect forest land in the coastal zone of Croatia in order\n            to enhance the landscape and recreation values of the region\n            and thereby contribute to restore tourism to its pre-war\n            level.  Other objectives are to: a) restore the\n            environmental role of coastal forests destroyed by the war,\n            by protecting soil and water, and initiate the restoration\n            of the natural vegetation; b) address the forest fire\n            problem; and c) develop the knowledge base for improved\n            management and protection of coastal forests.  The project,\n            to be implemented over 5 years, will include the following 3\n            components: a) reconstruction of coastal forests, a nursery\n            and an arboretum destroyed by war activities; b) forest fire\n            management in coastal areas including a comprehensive\n            package of prevention, presuppression, and suppression\n            measures; and c) support services including the development\n            of a geographic information system (GIS) for forest fire\n            management, coastal forestry research, institutional support\n            and project management and monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -
