Some lessons\n            learned included: constant collaboration and dialogue\n            between the Government and the Bank continued to be\n            fundamental for the success of the DPL program. The\n            Bank's strong field presence continued to facilitate\n            constant collaboration and dialogue with the Government, not\n            only on the DPL but also on other engagements that provide\n            synergies with the DPL. Such collaboration and dialogue also\n            benefited from the involvement of key reform champions, both\n            within the Government and the Bank, who were able to\n            complete actions in the timeframe agreed upon and ensure the\n            successful delivery of the DPL program. Mapping out a reform\n            program provides meaningful direction and substantive\n            results down the road, but a degree of flexibility is still\n            needed, especially to ensure sustained government ownership.\n            The continued policy dialogue under the DPL has strengthened\n            the knowledge base and allowed the Government to move\n            proactively and take precautionary measures at the time of\n            crisis. Establishment of the Financial System Stability\n            Forum (FSSF), for instance, has formed the basis for the\n            financial sector safety net and allowed the Government to\n            swiftly address systemic risks in the financial system. The\n            Government was also able to proceed quickly in requesting\n            for the Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO)-DPL, which eventually\n            helped in restoring public confidence and advancing other\n            policy reforms, particularly those under public financial\n            management and investment climate. Had the DPL been\n            non-existent, the swift resolution of the financial systemic\n            risks and quick delivery of the DDO-DPL at the time of\n            crisis would not have been possible. DPLs are only one\n            instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted\n            engagement, and the choice of instrument should be\n            contingent on the issue, the political context and the\n            institutional circumstances. This is particularly applicable\n            in the Indonesian case because of the size and scope of the\n            World Bank program in Indonesia. The Bank program in\n            Indonesia is one of the largest of any country in terms of\n            number of staff and overall resources. Large teams are\n            working closely on a daily basis with government\n            counterparts at often very senior levels on a wide range of\n            issues from public financial management and trade and\n            investment, finance, public expenditures and poverty. In\n            this context, the DPL is not the only instrument for\n            supporting reform, but rather complementary to other\n            instruments such as investment projects, Technical\n            Assistance (TA) and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fifth and Sixth Development\n            Policy Loan

Project is the fifth in a series of policy loans to\n            Indonesia, but the first proposed under the FY09-FY12\n            Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) that was approved by the\n            Board in September, 2008. The 4 earlier DPLs from 2004 to\n            2007 constituted a program of annual, single tranche loans\n            anchored to the previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).\n            The overall goal of the DPL-5 program is to help the\n            Government of Indonesia (GoI) achieve its medium-term growth\n            and poverty reduction objectives. The DPL-5 supports the\n            GoI's reform efforts in the following objectives: (i)\n            improve the investment climate; (ii) enhance public\n            financial management and governance; and (iii) improve\n            service delivery to the poor. The investment pillar is\n            aligned to the CPS objective of enhancing the environment\n            for private sector development to foster accelerated growth\n            and poverty reduction and strengthen competitiveness and\n            inclusiveness. The public financial management triggers are\n            also designed to support another key policy area of the CPS\n            on strengthening central government institutions and systems\n            through increasing accountability and transparency in\n            government financial management and to enhance public\n            financial management and governance to increase the\n            development impact of priority budget expenditures. Finally,\n            improving the institutional capacity to better target\n            poverty alleviation programs is a critical step to achieving\n            the CPS objective of more efficient delivery of public\n            services to reduce poverty levels and improve equity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fifth Development Policy Loan
