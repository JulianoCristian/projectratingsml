Some\n            of the lessons learned from the project are: 1) the building\n            of a relationship between Government and non government\n            organizations (NGOs) is a time-consuming exercise,\n            particularly if the parties are not obviously willing to\n            work together as partners from the beginning; 2) when\n            intermediaries are key actors in a project, it is important\n            to have appropriate eligibility criteria and pre selection\n            process to ensure that those intermediaries have the\n            necessary qualifications and experience to do the work. The\n            pre selection of NGOs must determine whether they have the\n            technical competence and financial capacity to meet their\n            obligations for carrying out sub-projects; and 3)\n            well-designed training programs for NGOs, as well as for\n            associations or groups of beneficiaries, should be an\n            integral part of the operation and should be a priority.
