For a complex\n            project with significant co-financing, ensure effective\n            implementation arrangements and review if necessary. At the\n            preparation stage, SPEAG was intended to disburse over a\n            period of 12 months, in order to reap the benefit of the\n            technical assistance in a timely manner. However, as became\n            quickly apparent, this was overambitious: First, the\n            complicated structure of the SPEAG with a number of\n            co-financing grants spread across various Technical\n            Assistance (TA) assignments. Second, the second Canadian\n            grant came in only as late as early 2003, more than 12\n            months into the project. Third, the absorptive capacity for\n            TA in Serbia's Ministries was limited given the tall\n            reform agenda faced by the key ministry staff. Lastly, the\n            complex design did not help the overburdened Ministry staff\n            as well as the Project Management Unit (PMU) in a system\n            which already proved ill-suited to implement quickly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia and Montenegro -
