The road improvement component was implemented\n            at approximately the estimated cost, yielding the estimated\n            rate of returns, in line with appraisal estimates. The Fund\n            for National and Regional Roads (FNRR), achieved\n            considerable institutional improvements, and the Customs\n            Administration in Macedonia, stands at the forefront within\n            the region, in recognition for its customs reform process.\n            Regardless of success, the following lessons learned are\n            suggested: 1) Although project design and its complexities,\n            should remain within the project's stated objectives, a\n            realistic overall implementation assessment, defines a\n            highly satisfactory achievement, vs. a troubled one, with\n            various difficulties stemming from inappropriate project\n            design. 2) Implementing government agencies are the primary\n            determinants for timely completion of individual project\n            components. Thus, FNRR's experience, contributed to the\n            timely civil works completion. 3) The government strong\n            commitment should convey that sense of ownership, paramount\n            for prioritizing specific activities. Conversely,\n            flexibility on the part of the Bank, would convey a sense of\n            willingness to consider particular circumstances, such as,\n            the high percentage approval of retroactive financing, a key\n            factor in easing implementation, and ensuring a timely completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia -

for transport in the former\n            Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia caused by the closure of the\n            Serbian and Greek borders, through the facilitation of\n            East-West transport so as to reduce transport costs; and 2)\n            strengthen the road management capabilities of the Ministry\n            of Transport and Communications, the Ministry of Urban\n            Development (MTC), Civil Engineering, and Environment\n            (MUDCEE), and the Republican Road Organization (RO) of the\n            former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The project will have\n            three components: 1) the civil works component will improve\n            the country's access to the ports of Bulgaria and\n            Albania through the rehabilitation and upgrading of about 60\n            km of the East-West Corridor; 2) the transit facilitation\n            component will fund technical assistance and equipment for\n            the development and implementation of a modern customs\n            system and the improvement of transit times; and 3) the\n            institutional strengthening component will fund technical\n            assistance and training to strengthen MTC, MUDCEE and RO in\n            the area of economic evaluation of different road\n            interventions and life-cost planning for pavement management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Transit Facilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Transit Facilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/03/732768/macedonia-transit-facilitation-project","projn":"MK-Transit Facilitation -- P008407","subtopic":"Airports and Air Services,Transport and Trade Logistics,Common Carriers Industry,Banks & Banking Reform,Roads & Highways","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970311121051"},"subsc":"Other domestic and international trade,Roads and highways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aim,asphalt,Bridge,Bridge Works,Civil\n            Engineering,civil works,civil works\n            component,Customs,customs procedures,domestic\n            traffic,drainage,dust,erosion,export,FISCAL\n            YEAR,framework,freight,freight traffic,fuel,fuel\n            taxes,handling,Highway,international\n            airports,MOTORWAYS,North-South\n            Corridor,parking,passengers,pavement,pavement\n            management,ports,present value,Rate of Return,road\n            deterioration,road drainage,road investments,Road\n            management,road network,road pricing,road\n            rehabilitation,Road users,roads,route,safety,SECONDARY\n            ROADS,Sharing,technical assistance,trade\n            facilitation,traffic,traffic\n            congestion,Transit,Transport,transport infrastructure,Urban\n            Development,user charges,vegetation,waiting time"},"1":{"cdata!":"aim,asphalt,Bridge,Bridge Works,Civil\n            Engineering,civil works,civil works\n            component,Customs,customs procedures,domestic\n            traffic,drainage,dust,erosion,export,FISCAL\n            YEAR,framework,freight,freight traffic,fuel,fuel\n            taxes,handling,Highway,international\n            airports,MOTORWAYS,North-South\n            Corridor,parking,passengers,pavement,pavement\n            management,ports,present value,Rate of Return,road\n            deterioration,road drainage,road investments,Road\n            management,road network,road pricing,road\n            rehabilitation,Road users,roads,route,safety,SECONDARY\n            ROADS,Sharing,technical assistance,trade\n            facilitation,traffic,traffic\n            congestion,Transit,Transport,transport infrastructure,Urban\n            Development,user charges,vegetation,waiting time"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"P6511"},"facets":{}}}
