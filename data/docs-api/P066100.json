Some lessons learned included:\n            the government commitment and implementation capacity of the\n            project should have been assessed independently of the\n            concomitantly designed adjustment operation. The task team\n            repeatedly discussed these problems with the Government, but\n            without success in gaining an early decision on how these\n            reforms should proceed whiles the disbursements continued at\n            a slow pace. This underlines the importance of more in-depth\n            risk analysis in project design and during implementation.\n            Testing projects on a pilot basis is important to their\n            success. Restructuring the treasury operation was an\n            important part of the project. Effective coordination of\n            activities with other donors and projects requires time and\n            can delay implementation. The decision to restructure the\n            project was opportune at that time because it quickly and\n            effectively assisted the Government with addressing the\n            pressing needs

P7512), which focus on improving\n            transparency and accountability in public financial\n            management; strengthening the tracking of poverty-reducing\n            public expenditures and monitoring their impact; improving\n            the strategic priority setting and transparency of public\n            expenditures; and promoting private sector development. In\n            line with these objectives, the Credit has the twin goals of\n            providing assistance in the design and implementation of the\n            Government's reform program, and of helping to build up\n            the institutional capacity and skills to carry out these\n            programs. The Credit has four components: 1) enhancing\n            accountability in public financial management by supporting\n            effective institutional arrangements for implementing the\n            public procurement law; and assisting in designing and\n            developing an institutional capacity for the Chamber of\n            Accounts; 2) strengthening public expenditure management by\n            automating the treasury system; 3) reforming social\n            expenditures by reviewing health expenditures, strengthening\n            the effectiveness of educational expenditures, defining an\n            effective safety net strategy, building the capacity of the\n            State Statistical Office, and providing pre-layoff\n            assistance to workers; and 4) promoting privatization and\n            private sector development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Second Institution Building\n            Technical Assistance
