Some\n            lessons learned included: the relative success of the public\n            finance management components of the program is partly due\n            to the combination of policy reforms supported by the ERSG\n            grant and technical assistance activities financed by the\n            restructured Economic Management Support Project (EMSP). It\n            can also be argued that a sector investment project\n            financing the rehabilitation of coffee plantations, washing\n            plants and rural infrastructure will have provided useful\n            additional support to the agricultural sector reforms\n            envisaged in the ERSG program and would have done more to\n            help 800,000 poor families than unrealistic privatization\n            programs. Bank country economists did most of the\n            preparation work even on sector policies with minimal\n            support from sector specialists. Agricultural sector\n            specialists would have spent more time on the preparation of\n            the agricultural component of the grant if the ERSG program\n            had been combined with sector work and project preparation\n            activity aimed at developing an agricultural sector\n            development project or program. Need for a better balance\n            between the development of social sectors and\n            growth-oriented infrastructure expenditure programs. The\n            availability of Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) funds\n            enabled the government to increase public expenditures in\n            the social sectors, particularly education. However, while\n            public spending on education increased to 6.1 percent of\n            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2005-06, public spending on\n            agriculture and infrastructure remained at very low levels\n            (respectively 0.3 and 0.6 percent of GDP). In the situation\n            of Burundi, stimulating economic growth is at least as\n            important as and probably more urgent than rapid increases\n            in social expenditures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Economic Reform Support Grant\n            (ERSG) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Economic Reform Support\n            Grant (ERSG)
