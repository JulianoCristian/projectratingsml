The\n            lessons learned indicate that the project managed to do NGO\n            contracting; but there were stark differences in perception\n            as to whether it was / should be a contractual or a\n            partnership arrangement (e.g., the NGOs saw themselves less\n            as a contractor and more as a partner, but the Government\n            saw the NGOs as contractors). Fund-flow arrangements need to\n            be simple; this is a systemic issue in Kenya and should be\n            resolved at the highest levels. This project appears to have\n            suffered from sub-optimal institutional arrangements.\n            Capacity building needs to be based on a detailed capacity\n            analysis, focusing not only on training, but more\n            comprehensively on systems, equipment, organizational\n            structures and organizational culture. It is not limited to\n            the Ministry level or the Government, but needs to be\n            applied to sub-national levels, to the NGOs and to the local\n            communities as well. Capital investments in hardware\n            components, especially civil works, should be only financed\n            if clearly justified based on need, and should not be\n            without appropriate linkages to the software components, or\n            adequate resources for maintenance, supplies and other\n            recurrent costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Early Childhood Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Early Childhood\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5527027/kenya-early-childhood-development-project","projn":"KE-Early Childhood Development -- P034180","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Teaching and Learning,Educational Sciences,Early Childhood Development,Primary Education","teratopic":"Education","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050103112623"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Primary education,Pre-primary education,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement, achievements, child growth,\n            Child health, classrooms, Community Grants, community\n            health, community involvement, curriculum, curriculum\n            development, dropout rates, EARLY CHILDHOOD, EARLY CHILDHOOD\n            DEVELOPMENT, Early Childhood Education, early childhood\n            interventions, policies, programs, education officers,\n            education sector, elementary schools, employment,\n            enrollment, food security, gender, Gross Enrollment, Gross\n            Enrollment Ratio, growth monitoring, head teachers, Human\n            Development, Immunodeficiency, information systems,\n            innovation, interventions, learning, learning materials,\n            learning readiness, Lessons Learned, let, malaria, managers,\n            media, Ministries of Education, mobility, nongovernmental\n            organizations, Nutrition, nutritional status, orphans,\n            parent education, parent involvement, parents, participation\n            rates, partnership, physical development, preprimary\n            schools, preschool children, preschools, primary education,\n            primary school, primary school teachers, primary schools,\n            primary teachers, Project Implementation, project\n            preparation, pupils, quality assurance, quality of\n            education, quality of life, rates of return, Reading,\n            reasoning, repetition, repetition rate, repetition rates,\n            resource centers, safe water, sanitation, school\n            performance, schools, short courses, social development,\n            staff development, study tours, Teacher, teacher attrition,\n            teacher training, teachers, teaching, teaching materials,\n            teaching methods, teaching styles, Technical assistance,\n            Tertiary education, text books, training of teachers,\n            training programs, tutors, workers, young children"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 1 (AFTH1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF022568-PHRD-KENYA EARLY CHILD\n            DEV/NUTRITION PROJECT,TF025159-PHRD-STUDENT FINANCING PROJECT,TF030559-CANADA GENERAL CTF FY04: AFRICA\n            - EDUCATION,TF030571-IDA CONSULTANTS POOLED CTF - FY04,TF036821-KENYA - EARLY CHILDHOOD DEV.

The\n            project seeks to: (1) improve child cognitive and\n            psycho-social development; (2) improve child health and\n            nutrition; (3) increase school enrollment at the appropriate\n            age; and (4) reduce dropout and repetition rates in lower\n            primary school.  An important collaborative objective is to\n            improve the human capital potential specifically of poor and\n            otherwise disadvantaged pre-schoolers.  The project consists\n            of two core components: (1) improving ECD worker training,\n            performance, and supervision; and (2) community capacity\n            building, mobilization, and parenting education.  Three\n            pilot interventions will test options to develop\n            cost-effective, replicable models for: (1) improving the\n            financing of ECD services in poor communities by way of\n            community grants; (2) raising nutrition and health standards\n            of pre-schoolers, including those in the particularly\n            vulnerable first three years of life; and (3) smoothing the\n            transition from pre-school to primary school."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -  Early Childhood Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya -  Early
