The underlying\n            objectives of the project were to reduce the pace of\n            deforestation in Indonesia; and to sustain and maximize the\n            flow of benefits from forest resource use. Bank's\n            performance through the project cycle was satisfactory.\n            Borrower\u2019s performance was satisfactory. The key lessons\n            learned were as follows (a) the system of management,\n            coordination and reporting which was in place by the end of\n            the project should have been developed earlier; (b) as far\n            as the components which were canceled from the loan are\n            concerned, perhaps the only real lesson to be drawn from\n            this is that it may have been useful had the Bank and the\n            government cooperated on a more timely and definitive\n            approach to the decisions needed; (c ) some important and\n            basic policy issues must be dealt with by government, to\n            allow the technical and other developments from the sector\n            programs which are in Indonesia to bear fruit; and (d) large\n            gaps remained in the program, especially in the difficult\n            areas of policy and institutional reform and development\n            because of lack of communication among the stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Forestry Institutions and\n            Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second Forestry\n            Institutions and Conservation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/01/733620/indonesia-second-forestry-institutions-conservation-project","count":"Indonesia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,Agriculture,area of\n            forest,biodiversity,biodiversity conservation,community\n            participation,Concession,Concession Management,conservation\n            activities,construction,deforestation,effective\n            use,environmental management,forest,forest areas,forest\n            concession,forest concessions,forest conservation,forest\n            dwelling,forest environments,forest funds,forest\n            inventory,forest land,forest land management,forest\n            loss,forest management,forest resource,forest resource\n            use,forest resources,Forestry,forestry agencies,Forestry\n            Institutions,forestry management,forestry research,forestry\n            sector,forests,human resource management,intervention,land\n            administration,managers,mangrove,mangrove forests,poverty\n            alleviation,programs,provincial\n            forest,Reforestation,resource management,rural\n            development,sustainable forest management,Tropical Forestry,watershed"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,Agriculture,area of\n            forest,biodiversity,biodiversity conservation,community\n            participation,Concession,Concession Management,conservation\n            activities,construction,deforestation,effective\n            use,environmental management,forest,forest areas,forest\n            concession,forest concessions,forest conservation,forest\n            dwelling,forest environments,forest funds,forest\n            inventory,forest land,forest land management,forest\n            loss,forest management,forest resource,forest resource\n            use,forest resources,Forestry,forestry agencies,Forestry\n            Institutions,forestry management,forestry research,forestry\n            sector,forests,human resource management,intervention,land\n            administration,managers,mangrove,mangrove forests,poverty\n            alleviation,programs,provincial\n            forest,Reforestation,resource management,rural\n            development,sustainable forest management,Tropical Forestry,watershed"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Rural development","projn":"ID-Forestry Icp II -- P003942","topic":"Forestry m1326646 436,Sustainable Forest Management m1327128 1057,Forests m1325978 1777,Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and\n            Degradation (REDD) m1327378 1757","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Forestry,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Water Conservation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Rural Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Agriculture,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019182833"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Forestry,Central government administration","theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Biodiversity,Other rural development","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Agriculture,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Forestry m1326646 436,Sustainable Forest Management m1327128 1057,Forests m1325978 1777,Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and\n            Degradation (REDD) m1327378 1757","owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","trustfund":"TF027650-FORESTRY II,TF026481-DUTCH-2ND FORESTRY INSTI. &\n            CONSERV.
