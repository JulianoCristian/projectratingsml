Lessons learned included:\n            the complexity of decentralization has a major effect on the\n            successful design and implementation of a project. Although\n            the Bank is often confronted with significant shifts in\n            political realities on the ground, this experience is not\n            usually very well captured in project design and\n            implementation. The PROSANEAR-TAL project was approved at\n            the end of 2000, but went through a large number of\n            political and administrative changes at the federal, state\n            and municipal levels that affected both project design and\n            implementation. Each change in counterparts at different\n            levels of government brought challenges to the level of\n            prioritization and the rhythm of implementation. In such\n            circumstances of shifting political priorities, the task\n            team has the option of either being client responsive and\n            adjusting the project accordingly, or cancelling the\n            project. Both approaches have numerous repercussions, to\n            which scant attention is often given. Continuing\n            implementation while simultaneously redesigning a project\n            can have significant impacts on the cost of supervision, can\n            delay implementation, and can impact the attainment and\n            measurability of project results during implementation. A\n            lesson learned of this project is that doing business in\n            increasingly decentralized and politically complex\n            environments will require flexibility and adaptability if\n            Bank projects are to remain relevant to the borrower and\n            implementers, but such flexibility will also result in\n            additional time and resource costs to the Bank. A centrally\n            coordinated and controlled project, which is implemented at\n            a decentralized level, as was the case of PROSANEAR-TAL,\n            necessarily involves a large number of actors and tradeoffs\n            with regard to the agility of implementation. To be\n            inclusive in such cases means adding to complexity by\n            involving more stakeholders in project implementation. This\n            has resulted in complex institutional arrangements in this\n            project. The Ministry of Cities and its Project Management\n            Unit (PMU), federal investment and development bank (CEF)\n            (both at the federal and municipal/state level), municipal\n            governments and their PMU, community organizations, service\n            providers of the different public services, the consulting\n            engineering firms and social outreach specialists, and the\n            Bank all participated in and contributed to the\n            project's implementation. Furthermore, the degree of\n            community participation throughout the subproject design and\n            implementation cycles needs careful analysis to identify the\n            optimal level of such participation in order to maximize\n            ownership but not unduly affect the time or cost of the\n            subproject cycle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
