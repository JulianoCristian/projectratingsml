Some lessons learned\n            included:  deep reforms changing the patterns of governance\n            and public sector management require adequate preparation,\n            including political economy assessment, consensus building\n            effort and wide political and social ownership. In the\n            absence of such thorough preparation, the likelihood of\n            success is low, irrespective of potentially huge long-run\n            gains for the country and society. In the post-conflict\n            environment, a development policy operation (DPO) instrument\n            can be effective if the reform program is well calibrated to\n            a context of weak technical capacity and multiple\n            priorities. In both countries, and for each operation,\n            ownership of reforms was permanently elusive, and was only\n            assured fleetingly by the lure of arrears clearance or debt\n            relief. Ownership of reforms by respective governments\n            followed a pattern of temporary commitment to reforms for\n            immediate returns. Incentives to governments, leadership and\n            ground conditions lacked for a successful pursuit of the\n            ambitious reform agenda in both counties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo,

Post-Reunification\n            Economic Recovery Credit for Congo were as follows: the\n            outcome was unsatisfactory, the sustainability was unlikely,\n            the institutional development impact was modest, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned from the project: When a reform program\n            supported by a quick-disbursing operation has a relatively\n            long implementation phase, a multi-year operation with\n            enough flexibility to account for evolution on the ground\n            and for unforeseen technical difficulties is likely to be\n            more suitable. Using adoption of an action plan as the\n            tranche release condition was a way to disburse the funds\n            quickly while tackling a large problem. In quick-disbursing\n            operation, it is important to limit the scope of the\n            immediate objectives so that they can reasonably be achieved\n            during the relevant time-frame. It was not possible to make\n            payment of retirees a tranche release condition because the\n            Government needed the tranche to pay the retirees.\n            Alternatively, the operation should be synchronized with the\n            Government's budget cycle, so that adequate allocations\n            could be made in the State budget to carry out the reform\n            programs. Also, comprehensive programs of capacity building\n            for Ministries and Government Agencies are important to\n            improve implementation; donors should be prepared to provide\n            assistance for this purpose. In the context of post-conflict\n            fragile states, a case could be made for a hybrid lending\n            instrument where funds provided by the Bank would be\n            earmarked for specific purposes but the involvement of the\n            Bank would not be as extensive as in investment projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6944074/congo-democratic-republic-post-reunification-economic-recovery-credit","projn":"ZR-Post-Reunification Economic Recovery\n            Credit -- P082443","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Expenditure Policy,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Government Diagnostic Capacity Building","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060724140412"},"subsc":"Banking,Other social services,General industry and trade sector,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, adjustment assistance,\n            agriculture, allocation, auditing, audits, balance of\n            payments, beneficiaries, budget constraints, budget cycle,\n            budget execution, budget management, budget support,\n            budgetary discipline, capacity building, Cash Basis, Central\n            Bank, Central government, civil servants, civil service,\n            civil service reform, civil service reforms, civil society,\n            commercial debt, competition policy, competitive process,\n            Competitiveness, CONGO, counterpart funds, Debt, Debt\n            management, decentralization, Development Policy,\n            development strategy, dividends, Economic Cooperation,\n            economic performance, economic programs, ECONOMIC RECOVERY,\n            economic reform, electricity, electricity services, Exchange\n            Rate, Exchange rates, expenditure plans, financial\n            institutions, financial management, financial reporting,\n            financial resources, financial sector, financial support,\n            Fiscal Balance, fiscal deficit, fiscal sustainability,\n            foreign exchange, Government budget, inflation,\n            Institutional Development, international reserves, lack of\n            resources, laws, legislation, local governments,\n            macroeconomic framework, Macroeconomic Indicators,\n            macroeconomic performance, macroeconomic policies,\n            macroeconomic policy, macroeconomic stability, Mbi,\n            medium-term development, ministerial committee, Ministries\n            of Finance, Ministry of Budget, Ministry of Finance, natural\n            resources, Official Gazette, oil prices, POVERTY REDUCTION,\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy, Private Sector, private sector\n            growth, private sector investment, Programs, provisions,\n            Public, public administration, public enterprises, Public\n            Expenditure, public expenditure management, public\n            expenditures, public sector, Public Service, Public\n            Utilities, public works, Quality Assurance, Real GDP, reform\n            objectives, reform program, reform programs, regulatory\n            framework, reorganization, retirement, service delivery,\n            social services, State budget, structural reforms, tax, tax\n            administration, technical assistance, transaction costs,\n            transparency, transparent governance"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 3 (AFTP3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Structural Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF030682-CANADA GENERAL CTF FY05: AFRICA\n            -

Implementation is generally\n            satisfactory. The objective of the PRERC in reform of\n            centralized payments, is to strengthen public expenditure\n            management, and the methodology established will permit the\n            government to reform its billing, and payments systems with\n            other utilities. The Development Credit Agreement states\n            that two general conditions must be met at the time of\n            meeting the PRERC public utilities (centralized payments)\n            tranche release: 1) the Association is satisfied with the\n            progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the\n            Program; and, 2) the macroeconomic policy framework of the\n            Borrower is satisfactory, as measured on the basis of\n            indicators, agreed upon between the Borrower and the\n            Association. Overall progress in implementation of the\n            PRERC-financed program is satisfactory and timely, and\n            Government's commitment remains firm. The Borrower has\n            met the condition for the release of the public utilities\n            (centralized payments) floating tranche of the PRERC. All\n            conditions for the release of the Centralized Payments\n            Tranche of the Post-Reunification Economic Recovery Credit\n            have therefore been met.

It\n            would assist the Democratic Republic of Congo in its\n            economic and social recovery, in the context of the\n            Government's 2004-2005 Reform, Growth, and Poverty\n            Reduction Programs.

multinational regional\n            demobilization and reintegration program; (ii) the\n            DRC's accruing new arrears on external debt because of\n            the increased debt service burden in the short run, even\n            though the overall debt burden in net present value terms\n            has been reduced greatly; (iii) the DRC losing international\n            financial support, with consequences in the country's\n            ability to service debt as well as in financing necessary\n            spending on social and economic rehabilitation, which is\n            mitigated by the International Development Association\n            (IDA's) working with other donors to assure a continued\n            high level of donor financing and providing guidance for the\n            measures, including the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            process, that will make permanent the debt service reduction\n            that followed the HIPC Decision Point; (iv) insufficient\n            institutional capacity, which is being addressed by\n            technical assistance and capacity-reinforcing activities\n            provided by IDA, the International
