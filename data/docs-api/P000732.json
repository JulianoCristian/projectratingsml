A number of lessons convey the following,\n            particularly, given the post-conflict situation in the\n            country, and, reinforces previous lessons learned, including\n            built-in project flexibility, appropriate donor\n            coordination, and, provision of procurement and financial\n            management training. Early intervention is critical to\n            eliminating bottlenecks that could lead to lengthy delays in\n            procurement, and/or approval of plans. Guidance needs to be\n            specific and solution-oriented, not in the form of\n            additional critique. Clients must be encouraged to be\n            forthcoming upon encountering difficulties, which should be\n            rewarded with advice that moves the project forward, not by\n            criticism and threats. Concurrently, Supervision should be\n            seen as an on-going, not just a semi-annual process.\n            Frequent visits to the field reduce the\" threat\"\n            factor to clients, and should be viewed as a support\n            activity, not one where criticism is paramount. In addition,\n            sub-sector programs need to be developed as part of broad\n            systemic approaches - both in terms of financial\n            availability to the sector, and in terms resulting from the\n            contention forces between graduates within the system, and\n            the demand for their skills within the labor force. The\n            balance between expansion and quality is a difficult one to\n            achieve: at mid-term it became apparent that an imbalance\n            was in the making. While the Government took steps to\n            redress the problem, donors could have recognized that\n            over-emphasis on achieving enrollment targets at all costs,\n            may well be counter productive. Nonetheless, establishing\n            targets that are ambitious, may help preserve the validity\n            of sector development plans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Education Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia -

It uses\n            non-formal education and radio programs. The second\n            component expands secondary schools, revises curriculum,\n            upgrades teachers, and increases instructional materials and\n            equipment. The third component consists of technical and\n            vocational education and training activities that encourage\n            private sector participation in order to tie training to the\n            job market, increase the availability of skilled labor, and\n            raise the employment rate. The fourth component upgrades and\n            expands teacher training institutes and colleges and uses\n            distance learning. The fifth component expands higher\n            education by encouraging private sector investment and\n            designing cost-sharing schemes to meet the country's\n            needs for educators, engineers, health workers, and public\n            administrators.
