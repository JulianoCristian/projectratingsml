The Bank\u0092s performance was moderately\n            satisfactory while the Grantee\u0092s performance was\n            satisfactory. Restructuring included a revision of the PDO,\n            as follows: The objective of the Project is to increase\n            access to piped water for the poor in the Recipient\u0092s city\n            of Maputo. Specifically, this change included the removal of\n            the four secondary cities and of the modality of providing\n            output-based payments to private operators. At restructuring\n            the total number of connections remained the same, but the\n            allocations for the four cities were transferred for\n            implementation in Maputo. Revised outcome indicators were\n            therefore changed to reflect the new connection targets for\n            Maputo. The following seven lessons were learned from this\n            project: (1) Output-based payments do not inherently provide\n            incentives for change in behavior or investment. (2)\n            Output-based programs need to assess ability of the\n            recipient to pre-finance investments and consider\n            pre-financing support mechanisms. (3) Verification\n            procedures should focus on the ultimate objectives of the\n            operation. (4) There needs to be a very strong understanding\n            of the characteristics of the intended beneficiaries. (5)\n            All the costs of program implementation accruing to the\n            operator should be factored into the Output Based Aid (OBA)\n            payments. (6) There needs to be a full appraisal at the time\n            of project restructuring. (7) Implementation arrangements\n            need to be realistic; assumptions regarding implementation\n            need to be linked to the relevant project, rather than to\n            goals related to other projects or programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -
