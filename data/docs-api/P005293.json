Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: (a) with\n            relatively complex project designs, implementation schedules\n            must allow for finalization of technical aspects of a\n            two-stage International Commodity Body (ICB) process and\n            pre-qualification procedures; (b) even with complex project\n            components, substantial benefits can be realized if the\n            enterprise is run on an autonomous basis and along\n            quasi-commercial lines, has a committed management team and\n            experienced operational staff, and gets sufficient support\n            from the government as the major shareholder; (c) under\n            present governance, the Borrower faces substantial financing\n            constraints on its investment program; (d) mining is a high\n            risk business that is best suited for private investors who\n            can assume such risks, and not for using scarce fiscal\n            resources under uncertain conditions; (e) since the Borrower\n            is one of Jordan's leading companies and is engaged in\n            producing an internationally traded commodity, partial or\n            full privatization of the company can and should be\n            considered which could yield substantial financial and\n            economic benefits; and (f) corporate management must be\n            flexible enough in such cases to quickly adjust corporate\n            strategy to market fluctuations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Integrated Phosphate Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Integrated Phosphate Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731893/jordan-integrated-phosphate-project","projn":"JO-Integrated Phosphate -- P005293","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Jordan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970909142552"},"subsc":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aluminum,balance of payments,Bank\n            Loans,Beneficiation,ceramic,competitiveness,devaluation,economics,effluents,EI,emissions,environmental\n            issues,equipment,exchange\n            rate,exports,farmers,feed,fertilizers,financial\n            management,financial resources,forecasts,Gross Domestic\n            Product,imports,integration,international\n            mining,liquidity,marketing,Metals,mine development,mine\n            operations,mine site,mineral resources,Minerals,Mines,mining\n            area,mining industry,mining operations,oil,oil\n            prices,Phosphate,plant production,potash,Private\n            Sector,privatization,producers,production costs,production\n            planning,Public Sector,renewable\n            resource,Sustainability,technical assistance,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"aluminum,balance of payments,Bank\n            Loans,Beneficiation,ceramic,competitiveness,devaluation,economics,effluents,EI,emissions,environmental\n            issues,equipment,exchange\n            rate,exports,farmers,feed,fertilizers,financial\n            management,financial resources,forecasts,Gross Domestic\n            Product,imports,integration,international\n            mining,liquidity,marketing,Metals,mine development,mine\n            operations,mine site,mineral resources,Minerals,Mines,mining\n            area,mining industry,mining operations,oil,oil\n            prices,Phosphate,plant production,potash,Private\n            Sector,privatization,producers,production costs,production\n            planning,Public Sector,renewable\n            resource,Sustainability,technical assistance,workers"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"16699"},"737287":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1990/01/737287/jordan-integrated-phosphate-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1990/01/737287/jordan-integrated-phosphate-project","new_url":"1990/01/737287/jordan-integrated-phosphate-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1990/01/08/000009265_3960928104534/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1990/01/08/000009265_3960928104534/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"3172","docdt":"1990-01-08T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1990-01-08T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Integrated Phosphate Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Integrated Phosphate Project is an\n            important second step in the development of the Shidiya\n            phosphate deposit, which will enable Jordan to increase its\n            export of phosphate rock and to increase foreign exchange\n            earnings.
