Some lessons learned included: DRM decisions\n            should be made based on perceived risk reduction benefits\n            and a combination of the physical and non-physical solutions\n            in a context of larger integrated river-basin management\n            scale.

Tailored\n            public information and awareness-raising, including gender\n            mainstreaming, are essential for commune participation,\n            accountability, and investment ownership. Operating and\n            maintenance (O and M) budget should be sufficiently\n            allocated through the government annual budget planning\n            cycle conducted in all levels. Strong institutional reform\n            and leadership of the coordination agency is essential for\n            project success and sustainability.

Government to: a)\n            strengthen the capacity of national and local disaster risk\n            management institutions; b) reduce the vulnerability to\n            flood and storm hazards in project areas; and c) increase\n            the efficiency of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction\n            efforts. The closing date of the project will be extended by\n            28 days from May 31, 2012 to June 28, 2012. This will be the\n            fourth extension of the project. The 28 day extension of the\n            closing date would allow the supplier of the equipment to\n            deliver the major part of the equipment to the Borrower,\n            thus allowing the partial financing for the contract\n            financed by the project.

As of December 26, 2011, the borrower has\n            satisfactorily completed the bid evaluation for the\n            procurement of the hydromet equipment carried out under the\n            International Competitive Bidding procedures and about to\n            award a contract. In June 2011, the Borrower had requested a\n            12 month extension to enable completion of the investments;\n            however, at that time, only six months extension had been\n            granted, and the Borrower was informed that further\n            extension would be granted provided that the procurement\n            process is completed in a satisfactory manner by December\n            31, 2011. This will be the third extension of the project.\n            As a result, a total extension period of 23 months would be\n            made from the original closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Natural Disaster Risk\n            Management Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15587556/vietnam-natural-disaster-risk-management-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"VN-Natural Disaster Risk Management Project\n            -- P073361","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Hazard Risk Management,Debt Markets,Natural Disasters,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Disaster Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Urban Development,Conflict and Development,Rural Development","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20111229234445"},"subsc":"Flood protection,Roads and highways,Health,General public administration sector,General education sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Urban Development,Conflict and Development,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, bid, Borrower, Competitive\n            Bidding, disaster management, disaster reconstruction,\n            DISASTER RISK, disbursement, equipment, EXTENSION, financial\n            management, flood, NATURAL DISASTER, RISK MANAGEMENT, RISK\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT, Rural Development, Typhoon"}},"owner":"Vietnam Sustainable Development (EASVS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF026834-PHRD-VIETNAM: NATURAL DISASTERS\n            MITIGATION PROJECT,TF051920-JSDF SEED-VIETNAM: COMMUNITY\n            BASED DISASTER MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF053466-JSDF SEED-VIETNAM:\n            COMMUNITY-BASED DISASTER MANAGEMENT PILOT PROJECT,TF054753-JSDF-VIETNAM:INNOVATIVE\n            APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY-BASED DISASTER RISK MAN,TF054754-JSDF-VIETNAM:INNOVATIVE\n            APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY-BASED DISASTER RISK MAN,TF055176-PHRD-VIETNAM: NATURAL DISASTERS\n            MITIGATION PROJECT,TF057258-VIETNAM: NATURAL DISASTER RISK\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF057385-NATURAL DISASTERS AND RISK\n            MANAGEMENT IN RURAL VIETNAM","repnb":"66169"},"14600076":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/07/14600076/vietnam-natural-disasters-risk-management-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/07/14600076/vietnam-natural-disasters-risk-management-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","new_url":"2011/07/14600076/vietnam-natural-disasters-risk-management-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","disclosure_date":"2011-07-20T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-07-20T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-07-20T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/07/20/000333037_20110720020357/Rendered/INDEX/633710PJPR0P070ructuring0Data0sheet.doc.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/07/20/000333037_20110720020357/Rendered/PDF/633710PJPR0P070ructuring0Data0sheet.doc.pdf","credit_no":"4114;4770","datestored":"2011-07-20T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-07-05T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Natural Disasters Risk Management\n            Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Natural Disasters\n            Risk Management Project for Vietnam are the establishment\n            and implementation of comprehensive natural disaster risk\n            management framework to assist the Government to: (a)\n            strengthen the capacity of national and local disaster risk\n            management institutions; (b) reduce the vulnerability to\n            flood and storm hazards in project areas; and (c) increase\n            the efficiency of post-disaster recovery and reconstruction\n            efforts. The executing agency, the Ministry of Agriculture\n            and Rural Development (MARD) in close collaboration with the\n            Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), has\n            prepared a detailed implementation plan for the remaining\n            activities towards project completion.
