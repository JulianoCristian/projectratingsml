The\n            objectives of the Matadi-Kinshasa Ports Rehabilitation\n            Project were to rehabilitate and modernize structures which\n            had suffered from inadequate maintenance and had to adjust\n            to container traffic. Both projects continued earlier\n            efforts to upgrade transport services on the Voie Nationale,\n            the main transport axis of the country and the only\n            evacuation route for mineral exports entirely within the\n            country. The physical implementation of the projects was\n            satisfactory, despite delays due to slow decisions on\n            procurement and some design problems, especially with\n            respect to civil works and computer equipment. Apart from\n            the delays, there were no major procurement problems. While\n            the cost of the ONATRA Modernization project was 5 percent\n            over estimates, the cost of the Port project was 28 percent\n            below. There were some modifications to the original\n            projects but they may be considered routine for this type of project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - ONATRA Modernization and Matadi -\n
