The main objective of the project was to assist\n            the Borrower in the execution of its 1987-1993 Highways\n            Program by: (a) financing the execution of technically and\n            economically feasible subprojects; and (b) providing\n            technical assistance. The Bank played a key role in shaping\n            the transport sector policy reforms and continues supporting\n            their implementation through technical assistance. Overall,\n            the project's outcome can be considered as marginally\n            satisfactory. The majority of the sector policy objectives\n            were achieved in a satisfactory manner. Lessons learned\n            included: 1) More attention should be given to defining a\n            set of performance indicators and developing a logical\n            framework under which each project component fits and is\n            clearly linked with the stated objectives. 2) The\n            operational aspects (budgeting procedures, flow of funds and\n            accounting) of a project should also receive more attention\n            during project preparation and be candidly discussed with\n            the various governmental agencies involved before starting\n            project implementation. 3) Incomplete and poor engineering\n            studies were one of the most critical factors that delayed\n            and led to cost increases in the execution of the works\n            financed under this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second National Highways Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Second National\n

long distances and difficult terrain separating the main\n            production and consumption centers.  Therefore, the Second\n            National Highway Sector Project consists of an investment\n            component to be financed under the loan, and of a policy\n            reform and institutional development Action Plan.  The\n            investment component consists of a time-slice of the\n            Ministry of Public Works and Transport's (MOPT)\n            1987-1993 highway program including (i) civil works for\n            rehabilitation of paved and gravel roads, for paving of\n            gravel roads, and for periodic maintenance of paved roads;\n            (ii) supervision of the corresponding road rehabilitation\n            and paving works; and (iii) road safety.  It further entails\n            (iv) road maintenance equipment and spares and a\n            communications system; (v) training programs; and (vi)\n            technical assistance.  Under the Action Plan the project\n            aims to (i) strengthen MOPT's highway management\n            capabilities; (ii) adjust sector policies, and (iii) improve\n            the transport budgetary process at the level of MOPT."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Second National Highways Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Second National\n            Highways Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/05/742049/colombia-second-national-highways-sector-project","projn":"CO-2nd Hwy Sctr -- P006810","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Business Environment","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926061043"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,account\n            maintenance,accounting,bottlenecks,budgetary\n            process,cation,Cement,Coal,construction,cost\n            recovery,Development Banking,economic\n            regulations,expenditure,expenditures,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,framework,Government intervention,Health\n            Services,Highways,Housing,institutional\n            development,insurance,labor productivity,maintenance\n            costs,modes of transport,paving,periodic\n            maintenance,ports,procurement,productivity,public\n            agencies,railways,Rate of Return,road conditions,road\n            construction,road improvement,Road Improvements,road\n            infrastructure,road maintenance,road safety,road\n            transport,road user charges,road users,roads,Rural\n            Roads,sales,savings,Steel,technical\n            assistance,Transport,TRANSPORTATION,trucking,vehicle\n            operating costs,water supply,Watershed"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,account\n            maintenance,accounting,bottlenecks,budgetary\n            process,cation,Cement,Coal,construction,cost\n            recovery,Development Banking,economic\n            regulations,expenditure,expenditures,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,framework,Government intervention,Health\n            Services,Highways,Housing,institutional\n            development,insurance,labor productivity,maintenance\n            costs,modes of transport,paving,periodic\n            maintenance,ports,procurement,productivity,public\n            agencies,railways,Rate of Return,road conditions,road\n            construction,road improvement,Road Improvements,road\n            infrastructure,road maintenance,road safety,road\n            transport,road user charges,road users,roads,Rural\n            Roads,sales,savings,Steel,technical\n            assistance,Transport,TRANSPORTATION,trucking,vehicle\n            operating costs,water supply,Watershed"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P4554"},"facets":{}}}
