The first\n            improves customs procedures, assists streamline operations\n            at three border posts and one inland terminal on a pilot\n            basis; provides customs training in new procedures, and\n            trains for agency awareness and cooperation; and\n            restructures the customs administration.

To\n            prevent, minimize, or mitigate site specific negative\n            impacts, however, this environmental management plan (EMP)\n            and a set of mitigation measures have been prepared. The\n            major concerns about possible negative site specific impacts\n            associated with border crossings relate to 1) emissions from\n            vehicles waiting for custom clearances; 2) drainage of\n            disinfectants and spills of oils and fuel; 3) waste disposal\n            and loose garbage; and 4) site disruptions caused by\n            upgrades or relocations of utilities or such infrastructure\n            as buildings, parking/waiting areas, and access roads.\n            Specific actions to minimize any potentially negative impact\n            and promote institutional development include liaising with\n            environmental authorities and reviewing and monitoring EMP\n            compliance; staff training and sensitization at each border\n            crossing; certifying acceptable practices and impact\n            minimization, especially storing and properly using\n            disinfecting materials and chemicals, and hazardous\n            materials and garbage; harmonizing regulatory requirements\n            with European Union and international standards; and\n            incorporating environmental plans in consultant contracts\n            and project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Trade and Transport Facilitation\n            in Southeast Europe - environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe - environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/02/438102/macedonia-trade-transport-facilitation-southeast-europe-environmental-management-plan","projn":"MK-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            South East Europe (Ttfse) -- P070089","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Energy and Environment,Environmental Governance,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00031505333328"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to\n            information,construction,disinfectants,drainage,emissions,Endangered\n            Species,environmental authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental officer,environmental\n            regulations,environmental report,environmental\n            reports,fuel,garbage,hazardous materials,Hazardous\n            Wastes,international conventions,litter,mitigation\n            measures,pilot site,potential threat,utilities,vehicle\n            emissions,waste,waste disposal"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to\n            information,construction,disinfectants,drainage,emissions,Endangered\n            Species,environmental authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental officer,environmental\n            regulations,environmental report,environmental\n            reports,fuel,garbage,hazardous materials,Hazardous\n            Wastes,international conventions,litter,mitigation\n            measures,pilot site,potential threat,utilities,vehicle\n            emissions,waste,waste disposal"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF038544-ALBANIA:  TRADE &\n            TRANSPORTATION FACILITATION,TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF040163-ALBANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - PROCURM,TF040162-ABLANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SE EUROPE - PROJECT LAUNCH,TF039898-ROMANIA-TRANSPORT AND TRADE\n            FACILITIES IN SE EUROPE,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.
