It is in support of the Plano Nacional de Saneamento\n            (PLANASA) whose objectives are to provide by the year 1990\n            90% of the urban population with piped water and 65% with\n            sewerage services. The estimated cost of the proposed\n            project is $US863 million. It includes about 60% of new\n            PLANASA investment for the 1983-84 period. The Bank loan\n            would cover 35% of the estimated project costs. All 26 SWCs\n            would be eligible to borrow Bank resources provided they\n            comply with eligibility criteria resources agreed with BNH\n            and the Bank. The project will support the goals of\n            PLANASA's program to benefit an estimated 33 million\n            people including 15 million below the poverty level. It will\n            substantially strengthen the operational capability of BNH,\n            especially in the areas of project selection, appraisal and\n            supervision. In addition it will provide institutional\n            support and strengthening to the SWCs. Important benefits\n            include: improved health, lower infant mortality, increased\n            labor productivity, and improved environmental conditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Water

It is in support of the Plano Nacional de Saneamento\n            (PLANASA) whose objectives are to provide by the year 1990\n            90% of the urban population with piped water and 65% with\n            sewerage services. The estimated cost of the proposed\n            project is $US863 million. It includes about 60% of new\n            PLANASA investment for the 1983-84 period. The Bank loan\n            would cover 35% of the estimated project costs. All 26 SWCs\n            would be eligible to borrow Bank resources provided they\n            comply with eligibility criteria resources agreed with BNH\n            and the Bank. The project will support the goals of\n            PLANASA's program to benefit an estimated 33 million\n            people including 15 million below the poverty level. It will\n            substantially strengthen the operational capability of BNH,\n            especially in the areas of project selection, appraisal and\n            supervision. In addition it will provide institutional\n            support and strengthening to the SWCs. Important benefits\n            include: improved health, lower infant mortality, increased\n            labor productivity, and improved environmental conditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Water Supply and Sewerage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/02/725483/brazil-water-supply-sewerage-project","projn":"BR-Water And Sewerage S -- P006332","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Health Economics & Finance,Sanitation and Sewerage,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901010598"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban water supply","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting period,accounting\n            systems,auditing,basic\n            sanitation,billing,capitals,collection performance,Cost\n            Analysis,cost recovery,cross-subsidization,debt,debt service\n            payments,decentralization,direct financing,economic\n            analysis,economic growth,economies of scale,effective\n            use,environmental protection,expenditures,external\n            auditors,financial covenants,Financial Data,Financial\n            Performance,financial resources,financial viability,Fiscal\n            Year,Flood control,funds flow,grant financing,health\n            conditions,Housing,income,infant\n            mortality,inflation,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,Investment planning,investment program,larger\n            towns,Least Cost,legislation,life expectancy,low income,low\n            income areas,Marginal Cost,metropolitan areas,mortality\n            rate,municipalities,operating costs,policy\n            discussions,pollution,pollution control,public health,public\n            services,quality standards,sanitary conditions,Sanitary\n            Engineers,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            investments,sanitation sector,sanitation systems,Service\n            Standards,sewage,sewage collection,Sewage\n            Treatment,Sewerage,SEWERAGE SECTOR,sewerage service,sewerage\n            services,sewerage systems,small communities,small\n            towns,solid waste,State Water Companies,State Water\n            Company,tanks,Tariff adjustments,technical assistance,urban\n            areas,urban development,urban growth,water connections,water\n            services,Water Supply,water supply projects,Water supply\n            service,water systems,water tariffs"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting period,accounting\n            systems,auditing,basic\n            sanitation,billing,capitals,collection performance,Cost\n            Analysis,cost recovery,cross-subsidization,debt,debt service\n            payments,decentralization,direct financing,economic\n            analysis,economic growth,economies of scale,effective\n            use,environmental protection,expenditures,external\n            auditors,financial covenants,Financial Data,Financial\n            Performance,financial resources,financial viability,Fiscal\n            Year,Flood control,funds flow,grant financing,health\n            conditions,Housing,income,infant\n            mortality,inflation,Institutional Development,interest\n            rates,Investment planning,investment program,larger\n            towns,Least Cost,legislation,life expectancy,low income,low\n            income areas,Marginal Cost,metropolitan areas,mortality\n            rate,municipalities,operating costs,policy\n            discussions,pollution,pollution control,public health,public\n            services,quality standards,sanitary conditions,Sanitary\n            Engineers,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            investments,sanitation sector,sanitation systems,Service\n            Standards,sewage,sewage collection,Sewage\n            Treatment,Sewerage,SEWERAGE SECTOR,sewerage service,sewerage\n            services,sewerage systems,small communities,small\n            towns,solid waste,State Water Companies,State Water\n            Company,tanks,Tariff adjustments,technical assistance,urban\n            areas,urban development,urban growth,water connections,water\n            services,Water Supply,water supply projects,Water supply\n            service,water systems,water tariffs"}},"owner":"WB Office: Brasilia, Brazil CMU (LCC5C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"4229"},"facets":{}}}
