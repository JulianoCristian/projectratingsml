Overall, the project outcome is\n            rated as satisfactory. Its institutional achievements are\n            rated as modest, and the sustainability of the project\n            benefits as uncertain. The Bank wasted a lot of time\n            managing the Project through a lot of interventions on minor\n            problems which should have been resolved by the Project\n            Management Unit (BPU). On the technical side, thanks to its\n            competent staff, helped by a technical assistance team, the\n            BPU turned in a good performance: On the other hand, another\n            point to be made is the fact that the final cost of the\n            Technical Assistance component proved much higher than\n            originally estimated. The thing is that the World Bank has\n            always shown great latitude where this component is\n            concerned, unlike its approach to the rehabilitation works\n            component. The Borrower would have preferred the contrary to\n            have been the case, since the portion of the credit used\n            would have thus amounted to a greater achievement in\n            concrete, perceptible terms, and would have consequently\n            been better accepted by the people. The Project achieved its\n            physical targets. From the financial point of view, it can\n            be considered as a good start and new efforts should help\n            consolidate the present project's achievements over the\n            long term, in particular by ensuring better cost recovery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
