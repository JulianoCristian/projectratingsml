The objective of the project was to increase\n            livestock production and consequently farmers' income.\n            It was also to encourage a variety of sectoral reforms, in\n            particular through: (a) shifting emphasis towards support of\n            small traditional producers; (b) utilizing the private\n            sector as instruments of production and input supply; (c)\n            introducing full cost recovery of farm inputs and veterinary\n            supplies; and (d) establishing a livestock sectoral planning\n            capacity. Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) vesting overall project\n            implementation on a federal institution without taking\n            cognizance of the state\u2019s involvement reduces project impact\n            and slows the rate at which project objectives could be\n            achieved; (ii) although the supply of farm inputs is best\n            left to the private sector, there must be some exceptions\n            mainly because of the nature of livestock operations and the\n            lack of incentives for retailers to market some specific\n            livestock feeds; (iii) farmer involvement at an early stage\n            in designing of project is essential; (iv) making the\n            project credit driven has at times caused the project to\n            slow down because of delay in disbursing funds to the\n            Nigerian Agricultural and Cooperative Bank Ltd (NACB\n            )branches in the field; and (v) experience with the\n            agropastoralist model has re-iterated the fact that new\n            technologies particularly with regards to livestock\n            production must be tested overtime and socio-economic\n            parameters established before they are presented for\n            adoption by farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Second Livestock Development
