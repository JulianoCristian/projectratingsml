and on-farm works, including construction\n            of field channels, drains, and structures covering a\n            consolidated area of about 57,000 ha."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Orissa Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Orissa Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1977/08/1557122/india-orissa-irrigation-project","projn":"IN-Orissa Irrigation Pr -- P009729","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902290069"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            growth,Agricultural production,agricultural\n            products,Agriculture,balance of payments,Bank lending,bank\n            loans,barley,budget deficit,capital goods,capital\n            requirements,capital use,cereals,coal,commercial\n            banks,commodities,consolidation,cropping,crops,cultivable\n            land,current prices,debt,development banks,development\n            organizations,development projects,distribution of\n            income,drainage,ecological conditions,economic\n            criteria,economic growth,economic rate of return,Economic\n            Situation,economists,effective\n            use,employment,equipment,exchange rate,Exports,extension\n            services,farmers,farms,FISCAL YEAR,food production,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,green revolution,growth rate,health\n            services,HYV,imports,income,income\n            levels,indica,inflation,interest\n            rate,irri,Irrigation,irrigation systems,labor force,Land\n            Development,LDCs,living\n            standards,maize,marketing,maturities,national income,oil,per\n            capita income,per capita incomes,population\n            growth,productivity,profitability,public debt,public\n            enterprises,public expenditures,return on\n            investment,rice,Rice yields,rural population,savings,seed\n            development,structural change,telecommunications,trade\n            balance,trade deficit,transport,urban\n            development,vegetables,water resources,water supply,water\n            use,water use efficiency,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            extension,agricultural extension services,agricultural\n            growth,Agricultural production,agricultural\n            products,Agriculture,balance of payments,Bank lending,bank\n            loans,barley,budget deficit,capital goods,capital\n            requirements,capital use,cereals,coal,commercial\n            banks,commodities,consolidation,cropping,crops,cultivable\n            land,current prices,debt,development banks,development\n            organizations,development projects,distribution of\n            income,drainage,ecological conditions,economic\n            criteria,economic growth,economic rate of return,Economic\n            Situation,economists,effective\n            use,employment,equipment,exchange rate,Exports,extension\n            services,farmers,farms,FISCAL YEAR,food production,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,green revolution,growth rate,health\n            services,HYV,imports,income,income\n            levels,indica,inflation,interest\n            rate,irri,Irrigation,irrigation systems,labor force,Land\n            Development,LDCs,living\n            standards,maize,marketing,maturities,national income,oil,per\n            capita income,per capita incomes,population\n            growth,productivity,profitability,public debt,public\n            enterprises,public expenditures,return on\n            investment,rice,Rice yields,rural population,savings,seed\n            development,structural change,telecommunications,trade\n            balance,trade deficit,transport,urban\n            development,vegetables,water resources,water supply,water\n            use,water use efficiency,wheat"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"P2124"},"facets":{}}}
