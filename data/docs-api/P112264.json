Some\n            lessons learned included: strong country ownership and\n            commitment to achieving the program's objectives was\n            essential to the success of this fast-disbursing lending\n            operation. This operation benefited from the fact that it\n            originated from a direct request from the Borrower seeking\n            additional financial support and backing for its long-term\n            objective of strengthening the business environment. Solid\n            country ownership of the supported policy agenda will\n            continue to be crucial as Program implementation continues\n            to move forward under a new administration although the risk\n            of policy reversal at this point appears to be manageable.\n            Prior strong analytical work and sustained policy engagement\n            by the Bank contributed crucially to quickly putting\n            together a policy operation of this magnitude and complex\n            design. The fruitful policy dialogue maintained by the Bank\n            with the Borrower over the years also allowed the former to\n            contribute with its rich baggage of global knowledge and\n            analytical work on the four policy areas covered by this\n            DPL. Outcome indicators are crucially important ingredients\n            for supervision and the final assessment of the\n            developmental achievements of any operation, so it is well\n            justified to spend time justifying their relevance and\n            viability in the program document. Closely linked with the\n            lesson in the previous paragraph, the proposed monitoring\n            system should thoroughly discuss the nature and\n            justification of the chosen outcome indicators as well as\n            sources of information to be used for their eventual evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Strengthening the Business\n            Environment for
