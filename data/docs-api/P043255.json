Some lessons learned\n            included: strong focus on a single development objective is\n            instrumental in achieving substantial changes in development\n            trends. In keeping a clear focus on girls basic education in\n            rural areas, the project not only surpassed its original\n            development objectives in the target governorates, but also\n            catalyzed additional support to basic education at the\n            national level from the government, local communities and\n            donors. Simple and flexible implementation arrangements with\n            an emphasis on strengthening the capacity of government\n            agencies proved to be effective in achieving project goals,\n            and ensuring ownership. In a context of weak capacity,\n            flexible implementation plans allow for corrective measures\n            with a main focus on achieving development objectives.\n            Community involvement in the definition of educational needs\n            is critical to ensure girls enrolment. Community\n            participation in the school site selection and construction\n            contributed to developing ownership. Community Participation\n            Unit (CPU) work with communities was instrumental in raising\n            awareness and mobilizing communities for girls education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic
