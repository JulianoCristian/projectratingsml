The project's achievements\n            included both health outcomes and institutional changes.  In\n            terms of health outcomes the project has made contributions\n            in four areas: extending the primary care model to nearly\n            100 percent of the population; reducing the demand for\n            hospitalization in areas of avoidable morbidity; reduction\n            of infant mortality; reduction of  hospital infections\n            through improved monitoring and evaluation under the\n            management agreements and the development of quality\n            assurance mechanisms. With regard to institutional changes,\n            the project demonstrates progress in terms of the\n            introduction of the PHC model, the separation of functions,\n            changes in financial resource management, and the\n            introduction of performance based payment systems. The\n            lessons learned are divided into overall comments on project\n            design and implementation; issues related to the separation\n            of functions, resource allocation and reimbursement\n            mechanisms; and the redefined primary health care model."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica -

These reforms must be\n            continued and consolidated to provide a base for sustained\n            and equitable development. The government aims to improve\n            the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of health\n            services. This project will support the Government's\n            effort to implement critical policy, institutional and\n            operational reforms. It will assist the Costa Rican Social\n            Security System (CCSS) institutional reforms at the central\n            level; support the implementation of a redefined model of\n            primary health care which would reinforce national priority\n            health care programs, while being responsive to regional and\n            local programs, and address operational and management\n            issues such as clinic protocols, referral systems, staffing\n            patterns, and monitoring and evaluation; strengthen the CCSS\n            financial complex; and prepare for the establishment of a\n            National Surveillance and Quality Control Laboratory. The\n            project will also explore alternatives and establish\n            parameters for further refinement in the sector. It will lay\n            fiscal and strucutral frameworks for complete reform of the\n            entire health sector. These measures will have far reaching\n            medium and long term impacts on the social security and\n            health care provision systems in the country. It represents\n            the first step in the restructuring of the CCSS to improve\n            efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the social\n            security system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Health Sector Reform : Social\n            Security System Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Health Sector Reform\n            : Social Security System Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/09/734557/costa-rica-health-sector-reform-social-security-system-project","projn":"CR-Health Sector Reform -- P006954","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Health Systems Development & Reform,Gender and Health,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Costa Rica","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005044330"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration,Non-compulsory health finance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abortion,adolescents,aging,alcohol,basic\n            health care,clinics,communicable diseases,crowding,death\n            rate,deaths,dentists,doctors,employment,expenditures,feasibility\n            studies,females,Health Care,health care financing,health\n            care providers,health care services,health posts,health\n            professionals,health provision,Health Sector,health\n            services,health status,health system,Hospital\n            beds,households,illiteracy,income,infectious\n            diseases,Insurance,Life Insurance,managers,media,medical\n            care,medical services,medical\n            supplies,mortality,nurses,nursing,Nutrition,Old\n            Age,patients,physicians,pregnancy,primary care,primary\n            health care,private sector,pubLic health,pubLic health\n            services,public sector,quality control,quality of health\n            care,risk factors"},"1":{"cdata!":"abortion,adolescents,aging,alcohol,basic\n            health care,clinics,communicable diseases,crowding,death\n            rate,deaths,dentists,doctors,employment,expenditures,feasibility\n            studies,females,Health Care,health care financing,health\n            care providers,health care services,health posts,health\n            professionals,health provision,Health Sector,health\n            services,health status,health system,Hospital\n            beds,households,illiteracy,income,infectious\n            diseases,Insurance,Life Insurance,managers,media,medical\n            care,medical services,medical\n            supplies,mortality,nurses,nursing,Nutrition,Old\n            Age,patients,physicians,pregnancy,primary care,primary\n            health care,private sector,pubLic health,pubLic health\n            services,public sector,quality control,quality of health\n            care,risk factors"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF020775-TECHNICAL COOP WITH USSR/PRE-AGREEMENT,TF037029-LAC REGION - HEALTH FOR COSTA\n            RICA, HONDURAS, NICARAGUA, BRAZIL,TF034155-LATIN AMERICA REGION - HEATLH PROJECTS,TF021398-HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT","repnb":"11986"},"facets":{}}}
