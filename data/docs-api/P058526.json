Due to the\n            Government's delay in issuing the Presidential Decree\n            455/99 required for loan signing, the Loan became effective\n            in February 2000, nine months after the approval by the\n            Bank. A presidential election, which took place during this\n            period, left the Federal budget discussion for the\n            Government's Fiscal Year 2000 incomplete, seriously\n            affecting a number of activities including this project. The\n            new Administration no longer considered this project a\n            priority, replaced the initial Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) in March 2000, and did not assemble the successor\n            until the end of April 2000. A Bank mission visited\n            Argentina during the week of June 19-23, 2000. The PIU\n            proceeded with the implementation following the mission.\n            However, the Government later came to a decision to cancel\n            the project due to the ongoing fiscal crisis and the\n            shifting of priorities by the new Administration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
