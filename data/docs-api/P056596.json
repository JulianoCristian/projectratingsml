Some\n            lessons learned included: as noted, the project office (PO)\n            encountered several problems in applying the agreed\n            resettlement procedures and compensation rates. Some of the\n            delays were the result of the city taking a more respectful\n            attitude towards affected persons and taking time to\n            negotiate mutually accepted solutions. The Bank welcomes\n            this evolution in attitudes and therefore does not consider\n            it unsatisfactory. The key performance indicators were\n            focused and prima facie appropriate, but numerous. To retain\n            focus and to simplify the PO's task, fewer indicators\n            will have been better. The question remains, however, how to\n            capture the strengthening of institutional capacity in a\n            meaningful way. The issue suggests the need for a Bank-wide\n            review to examine international best practice and update\n            Bank guidance on indicators suitable for urban transport\n            projects. This project provided a rare example of\n            center-street (median) bus lanes without physical lane\n            dividers. SJZ is to be commended for taking the initiative\n            to experiment with this approach, as only the second city in\n            China to do so. It is to be regretted that the city and\n            provincial governments later opted to terminate the median\n            bus lanes, without a full documentation and discussion of\n            its benefits and disadvantages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shijiazhuang Urban Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shijiazhuang Urban\n            Transport
