Overall, world Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated satisfactory. Key lessons learned\n            from this project were as follows: Developing the project\n            and setting its objectives within a macroeconomic and policy\n            framework based on a previous structural adjustment loan\n            operation and related sector studies was a positive factor\n            for its success. Obtaining full commitment right from the\n            start of preparation, from both the government and the\n            Borrower proved to be instrumental in efficient project\n            appraisal and implementation. Setting realistic objectives\n            in line with the country's strategy, sector priorities,\n            and consistency with the borrower's managerial capacity\n            was important for satisfactory project outcome. Project\n            appraisal should have been postponed until the power sector\n            was completely reorganized and all project components had\n            been fully defined. Strengthening the Borrower's\n            financial management proved to be valuable in preparing the\n            Borrower to access international capital markets\n            successfully and to obtain added resources for its\n            investment program without the need for further government\n            guarantees. Frequent supervision by the same Bank team,\n            particularly in procurement, contributed to project success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Czech Republic - Power and Environmental\n

     northern Bohemia, and thereby improve the environment and\n            health of the local population; to modernize the\n            transmission system; and to facilitate interconnection of\n            the Czech Power Enterprise (CEZ) and German power grids.\n            These objectives will be accomplished in the context of\n            overall reform of the energy sector.  To this end, the\n            project will:  (a) reduce total consumption of\n            pollution-causing lignite through power plant efficiency\n            improvements; (b) curtail power plant sulfur dioxide (SO2)\n            emissions by means of flue gas desulfurization; (c) reduce\n            dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants; (d) increase\n            the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ\n            transmission system; and (e) assist in improving investment\n            planning and corporate management and organization.  The\n            project includes:  (a) installation of equipment and\n            operational improvements at the Prunerov II power station\n            and other large CEZ power plants to reduce lignite\n            consumption; (b) installation of flue gas desulfurization\n            equipment at Prunerov II; (c) improvements and equipment for\n            dust collection,; (d) modernization of five 400-kV\n            substations and construction of a short 400-kV transmission\n            line; and (e) consulting services and staff

     northern Bohemia, and thereby improve the environment and\n            health of the local population; to modernize the\n            transmission system; and to facilitate interconnection of\n            the Czech Power Enterprise (CEZ) and German power grids.\n            These objectives will be accomplished in the context of\n            overall reform of the energy sector. To this end, the\n            project will: (a) reduce total consumption of\n            pollution-causing lignite through power plant efficiency\n            improvements; (b) curtail power plant sulfur dioxide (SO2)\n            emissions by means of flue gas desulfurization; (c) reduce\n            dust and fly-ash pollution from power plants; (d) increase\n            the reliability, efficiency and economy of the CEZ\n            transmission system; and (e) assist in improving investment\n            planning and corporate management and organization. The\n            project includes: (a) installation of equipment and\n            operational improvements at the Prunerov II power station\n            and other large CEZ power plants to reduce lignite\n            consumption; (b) installation of flue gas desulfurization\n            equipment at Prunerov II; (c) improvements and equipment for\n            dust collection,; (d) modernization of five 400-kV\n            substations and construction of a short 400-kV transmission\n            line; and (e) consulting services and staff training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Czechoslovakia - Power and Environmental\n            Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Czechoslovakia - Power and\n            Environmental
