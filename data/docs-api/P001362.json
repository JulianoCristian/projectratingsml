Nonetheless, the institutional\n            innovation, represented by the Higher Education Loans Board,\n            showed a steady improvement in loan recovery performance,\n            and, greater coordination of public universities, with the\n            creation of a culture planning, were positive aspects. The\n            uncertain sustainability needs to be addressed, namely, at\n            financing policies, and, at departmental levels, where\n            equipment, and library materials were delivered. The key\n            lessons address, first, general applicability, which\n            indicate the disadvantaged position of a Project\n            Implementation Unit being responsible for several projects\n            at a time, thus diminishing accountability to stakeholders,\n            in comparison to a single operation focus. Project design\n            should reflect the procurement, and financial management\n            capacity, as well as monitoring of development objectives,\n            to be assessed at appraisal. Secondly, university projects,\n            should contain a balanced design between responsibility\n            decentralization to universities, and central coordination.\n            This could have an impact through the full engagement of\n            Vice-Chancellors, to achieve better policy reforms, and,\n            financial accountability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -

Universities Investment Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the project are to\n            support the government's program to consolidate and\n            develop the universities by:  (a) rationalizing and\n            strengthening the institutional framework for higher\n            education, in both the public and the private sectors; (b)\n            limiting the growth of government budgetary resources\n            devoted to the public universities by promoting cost sharing\n            and improved investment planning; and (c) improving the\n            quality of the teaching and research delivered at the public\n            universities.  The project consists of two major components.\n            At the central level, it will strengthen the Commission for\n            Higher Education, reform the Student Loan Scheme, carry out\n            relevant studies, support applied research, and implement\n            the project.  At the six public university institutions, the\n            project will support subprojects concerned with\n            institutional development, staff development in key areas,\n            and the supply of teaching and related equipment, especially\n            for science and engineering."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Universities Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya -
