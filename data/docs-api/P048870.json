Public Sector Management Loan: the outcome\n            was moderately satisfactory, the sustainability was likely,\n            the institutional development was modest, the Bank and\n            borrower performance were both unsatisfactory.

Rio Grande Do Sul State Reform Loan: the\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            likely, the institutional development was modest, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. Rio the Janeiro State Reform\n            Privatization Loan: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development was\n            modest, the Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            the borrower performance was satisfactory.

The major lessons of general applicability\n            from the five loans assessed include: Continuity of Bank\n            interventions is important for promoting lasting\n            institutional change. Sub-national programmatic loans offer\n            advantages, in this respect, over time-bound State Reform\n            Loan (SRLs). The principles of the Levy Report remain\n            relevant for designing financial sector lending operations.\n            Credit lines (financial intermediary loans) are unlikely to\n            be appropriate instruments for supporting financial sector\n            adjustment. Reconciling project expenditures fully and\n            correctly at closing is a core Bank responsibility. An\n            oversight agency operating within an appropriate regulatory\n            framework is an important prerequisite to successful\n            privatization of public services. As investment loans, the\n            SRLs proved to be cumbersome instruments for supporting\n            structural change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Public Sector Management, Private\n

Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances were satisfactory\n            overall. This project has demonstrated that sustained\n            Borrower commitment as well as continuity were critical to\n            the success of reform, and also, that, within the basic\n            program strategy, flexibility is necessary to adapt actions\n            to changes, unforeseen difficulties, or political\n            opposition. Even if immediate solutions are not optimum,\n            they are preferable to delays or abandonment of the process,\n            particularly when inefficiencies can be remedied later\n            through complementary measures. Other lessons included:\n            Formulating conditions regarding liquidation/closures more\n            precisely; establishing regulatory agencies as soon as\n            possible so that they can build capacity before\n            privatization starts; governing the essential\n            characteristics of state regulatory agencies by federal law\n            in order to avoid the

medium size private sector firms\n            willing to provide services and secure financing for\n            investments; agreeing to compensation payments before the\n            actual transfer
