As a result of its uniqueness, the strong\n            vested role of the Argentine military, and the Bank's\n            limited historic involvement in the defense sector, the\n            PERAL II program was innovative and creative. A key\n            requirement of the privatization process for oligopolistic\n            industry is the enforcement of laws that effectively promote\n            competition and protect consumer rights. Although these laws\n            existed, there institutional and enforcement capability was\n            minimal. With this inadequate framework, it was almost\n            impossible to intervene solely through bidding documents.\n            Therefore, there was further concentration in asset\n            ownership, especially in the steel and petrochemical\n            sectors. The lesson is that statements of competitive\n            principles in sales memoranda may not be appropriate in\n            enforcing ant monopolistic behavior during the privatization\n            process. Therefore, strong laws and institutions need to be\n            well in place. Managing cross-ministerial relationships and\n            multiple objectives is complex under a single loan. This\n            loan's principal objective was to privatize Public\n            Enterprises (PEs) under the Ministry of Defense. However,\n            since a large number of PEs were in the tradable sector,\n            there was a need to modify the prevailing laws for\n            competition policy and costumiers protection, which was the\n            primary responsibility of the Ministry of Economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Second Public Enterprise Reform\n            Adjustment Loan Project (Peral
