management. The\n            proposed Project would provide for: (a) strengthening of\n            OCIR-Cafe's financial management; (b) improvement of\n            extension services under the direction of OCIR-Cafe; (c)\n            promotion of improved methods of plantation maintenance,\n            coffee nursery organization and pest control, distribution\n            of improved seed varieties, intercropping of banana\n            plantations to increase food crop production and a program\n            to improve soil fertility; (d) improvement of 120 existing\n            hand-pulping centers and establishment of 130 new ones; (e)\n            construction of two new landing points on Lake Kivu, of\n            bridges and culverts and minor improvements to three\n            existing landing points; (f) strengthening of crop-related\n            research, studies and trials; and (g) the services of four\n            internationally recruited specialists, and of short-term
