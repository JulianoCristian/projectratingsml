The performance of the Bank\n            was highly satisfactory, stemming from a project design that\n            fitted with the prevailing sectoral objectives,\n            straightforward procurement arrangements, and project\n            supervision that worked closely with the borrower, namely\n            the presence of an energy team in the field office. The\n            performance of the Borrower was satisfactory, with\n            appropriate entities involved in assisting the Bank in the\n            overall design, and providing relevant technical, and\n            financial inputs. Regardless of success, some key lessons\n            may be drawn from the project, mainly that the need for\n            coordination with the International Finance Corporation\n            (IFC), in the preparation of a fast track project, involving\n            the private sector within time, and budget constraints,\n            would ensure smooth project preparation. For although the\n            Government decided that it was not prepared to risk delays\n            with the IFC's proposal, nor was it ready to establish\n            a separate entity with majority private ownership, the issue\n            was resolved by agreeing to the Bank's condition\n            (build, operate, transfer approach), which ensured private\n            sector participation. The protracted process of government\n            approvals, such as long-term gas contract, and tariff\n            adjustment, were risks much higher than envisioned, but\n            flexibility, and the above-average staff skills demonstrated\n            through all project stages, proved successful."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Viet Nam -
