Some\n            lessons learned included: when the global financial crisis\n            erupted in September 2008 and the government asked the Bank\n            for urgent financial support, the Bank was able to come\n            through in record time. The capability to respond quickly to\n            changing country and/or international conditions is\n            essential for maintaining the relevance of the Bank and for\n            its relationship with its clients, particularly with the\n            middle-income countries. The design of the policy matrix\n            balanced ambition and breadth with a focus on areas with\n            strong government commitment. Striking such a balance at the\n            beginning of the series is not an easy task. On the one\n            hand, setting out to do only the reforms that are most\n            likely to be achieved would make for a more satisfactory\n            performance at the end of the program. On the other hand, it\n            is most beneficial if the program can be used to push\n            forward difficult reforms. While a small fraction of the\n            outcomes in the FMCDPL program were not achieved, resulting\n            in only satisfactory performance, the work that took place\n            in the less successful areas had moved the agenda forward\n            and prepared the ground for future reforms, which are being\n            continued and implemented at this time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - First and Second Programmatic Fiscal\n            Management and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - First and Second\n            Programmatic Fiscal Management and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16518715/peru-first-second-programmatic-fiscal-management-competitiveness-development-policy-loan-project","projn":"PE-Third Programmatic Fiscal Management\n            & Comp.

Competitiveness Development Policy Loan for\n            US$100 million is the last in a programmatic series of\n            Fiscal Management and Competitiveness Development Policy\n            Loans (FMCDPL). The FMCDPL series, along with parallel\n            Development Policy Loans (DPLs) in the areas of social\n            policy and environment, were designed in close partnership\n            with Government of Peru (GoP) and in line with its policy\n            program- as outlined in the Country Partnership Strategy\n            (CPS). The development objective of the loan is to\n            contribute to growth and poverty alleviation by supporting\n            two main policy areas: (i) efficiency and quality of fiscal\n            management and (ii) competitiveness. Peru entered the global\n            crisis in a solid position and has managed its challenges\n            well. Good macroeconomic fundamentals and appropriate policy\n            responses to the crisis moderated the negative impact of\n            weaker external demand and external shocks. Aware of the\n            downside risks to economic growth as well to poverty and\n            employment, the GoP implemented counter-cyclical policies to\n            mitigate the impact of the crisis. Nonetheless, the GoP has\n            not lost sight of the medium-term objectives of its reform\n            agenda, and has continued to make progress in improving the\n            effectiveness of fiscal management and supporting the\n            country's competitiveness and integration into the\n            global economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Fourth Programmatic Fiscal Management\n
