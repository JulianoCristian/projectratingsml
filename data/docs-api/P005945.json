Some\n            lessons learned included: project design must be flexible to\n            respond to changes in country policies. When the\n            administration decided in late 1989 to allow privatization\n            of National Sanitation Works and established a Privatization\n            Committee, the Bank's support and commitment were\n            critical in making a success of the effort. However, such an\n            important change in the project concept should have been\n            done on the basis of a comprehensive review of the\n            project's scope and objectives in light of the changed\n            policy stance in the federal government in 1989-90.\n            Macro-context and Sector policies should be carefully\n            evaluated. The decentralization policy of the government,\n            while well oriented, lacked a framework of incentives to\n            promote efficiency in the provincial utilities. With the\n            lack of clarity in government policies at the time of\n            appraisal (February, 1985) and taking into consideration the\n            delay to make the loan effective (26 months), it would have\n            been advisable, at least, to re-evaluate the project concept\n            and the risks associated in its implementation. Such a\n            decision would have been fully justified by the rapidly\n            changing institutional environment of the sector during\n            1985-1987, and the deterioration of the overall economic\n            conditions. Anticipate requirements of technical assistance.\n            The technical assistance component of the project, about US$\n            2.0 million, or 3.3 percent of the loan was disproportion\n            ally small when considering the challenge of the major\n            sector reforms underway at the time of project preparation.\n            Through loan amendments technical assistance was increased\n            to US$18.5 million, corresponding to 49 percent of the loan\n            amount, after partial cancellation of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Water Supply
