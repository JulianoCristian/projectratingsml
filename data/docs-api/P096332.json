Some lessons learned included: while the City\n            Council of Maputo (CCM) was undergoing a restructuring to\n            align staff with functions, improving its governance, and\n            strengthening fiduciary management, it was also addressing\n            service delivery constraints, primarily in the areas of\n            solid waste management, urban planning, and roads. Combining\n            institutional reforms with service delivery helps in\n            building the capacity of the implementing agency to carry\n            out its mandate through learning by doing. It also helps to\n            facilitate engagement with the citizens who are benefiting\n            from the improved services. Report cards are often seen as\n            an unreliable source of information on quality of services,\n            because they ask people their opinion of services rather\n            than report on objective measures of service delivery. Thus,\n            people may say services are declining when they are actually\n            improving, because their expectations have risen. In Maputo,\n            regardless of their findings, the report card surveys have\n            proven to be a valuable tool in furthering the dialogue\n            between service providers and citizens. Each year, staff of\n            the CCM meet with Maputo residents in public forums and must\n            address questions raised by participants. This has proven\n            critical in motivating CCM staff to focus on service\n            delivery, and appears to be changing the balance of power\n            between citizens and municipal government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - ProMaputo, Maputo Municipal\n            Development Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - ProMaputo, Maputo\n
