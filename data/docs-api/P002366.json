Some lessons learned\n            included: The benefits of comprehensive sector-wide\n            institutional reforms. Attempts in earlier transport\n            projects to reform transport institutions had limited\n            success and at effectiveness the third quality at entry\n            assessment (QEA3) expressed concern about the ambitious\n            reform program. However, the project took on, among others,\n            the objective of increasing private sector involvement in\n            investment and management of the sector and achieved this\n            objective fully. PST2 also provided ample resources to\n            strengthen the institutions and brought about an improvement\n            in the regulatory framework for transport institutions.\n            Sustained commitment and partnership as a condition for\n            effective implementation and completion of a complex\n            project. The QEA3 noted the complexity of project design and\n            the implementation risks attached to that. PST2 did face\n            serious implementation difficulties and delays, but achieved\n            its objectives, albeit with three extensions. Conditions for\n            readiness for implementation are met. The project was\n            initially not fully ready for implementation because of the\n            marginally satisfactory preparation and the great complexity\n            of its design. The overly complex design obscured the fact\n            that conditions for reform, procurement, and privatization\n            had not been put in place and that implementation and policy\n            risks had not been adequately identified or mitigated. Not\n            only effectiveness require two additional preparation\n            missions, but it became clear early on that the preparation\n            of the arrangements for institutional and regulatory reforms\n            and for procurement and monitoring were not complete."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Second Transport Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal -

changes in the transport sector's strategy:\n            a) Decision to build a new airport, when the project was\n            initially supposed to support the management concession of\n            the existing airport - Leopold Sedar Senghor International\n            Airport; and, b) Decision to use resources from bonds on the\n            local market for construction of a third berth of the\n            container terminal in the port, whereas private financing\n            was initially foreseen through Build Operate Transfer (BOT).\n            In addition, the implementation of the Civil Aviation and\n            Land Transport Administration components has been lagging;\n            some measures have been under way for one year without being\n            finalized, thereby preventing achievement of the\n            components' objectives, and, two new executing agencies\n            (Railway Concessionaire and Road Agency) were created, thus,\n            there is a need to take into account the transfer of\n            responsibilities to these agencies. Amendment to the\n            Development Credit Agreement (DCA) is justified based on the\n            need to: 1) reallocate funds; 2) take into account the new\n            executing agencies - the Railway Concessionaire for the\n            Railway Component and the Road Agency for the Road\n            Maintenance Component; 3) close the two Project Agreements\n            with the port authority and the former public railway\n            company; 4) close the Port, the Land Transport\n            Administration, and the Civil Aviation components; and, 5)\n            extend the Credit closing date.

Project\n            implementation. The environmental assessment examines the\n            impact on the environment caused by the construction of\n            roads, railways, ports, and airports, envisaged to affect\n            natural habitats due to deforestation, river flows\n            disturbance, and landscape degradation, and, because of\n            abusive exploitation of construction materials, and mining\n            of phosphates and iron ore. Improper disposal of airplane\n            parts may induce radioactive hazards, which will further\n            threaten water, air, and noise pollution. These factors,\n            will affect rural and urban environments, due to water/soil\n            degradation, and, disturbances caused by gas emissions due\n            to increased traffic, respectively. Mitigating measures\n            re-enforce regulation of vehicle technical controls,\n            including the use of lead-free gas, and safety measures.\n            Hydrocarbon and oil spillage should be regulated in\n            accordance to established exploration measures, and\n            likewise, domestic and industrial wastes should be also\n            monitored, and analyzed. Wastes should be disposed of in\n            accordance with ecological trash collection, and disposal\n            regulations. Adequate site selection will maximize social\n            protection, as it will avoid disturbance on rural land, and\n            relocation of affected populations, and, public hygiene will\n            benefit from improved sanitation measures.
