The lessons learned indicate that with\n            appropriate technical assistance and application of policy\n            guidelines, the District Development Committee (DDCs) have\n            proven that they are capable of undertaking planning and\n            implementing rural road programs. Within His Majesty's\n            Government of Nepal (HMGN's) decentralization policy\n            framework and guidelines and implementation modalities, Bank\n            assistance for rural infrastructure can be effectively\n            provided. With close monitoring and effective planning\n            tools, local capacity can be harnessed in project selection\n            and implementation and local political incentives can be\n            minimized in project selection. Decentralization of\n            responsibilities to local governments is most effective by\n            applying new institutions and \"rules of the game\"\n            that can change the incentive structure and the political\n            economy of local bodies. Community-based organizations\n            (CBOs) offer a viable institutional option for carrying out\n            small civil works, but they require upfront mobilization and\n            technical support to ensure timely and quality delivery of\n            outputs. The benefits of small rural road works are mostly\n            savings in travel time, improved access to markets, and\n            social service facilities. The provision of technical\n            assistance needs to give strong emphasis on direct support\n            to DDCs and CBOs. It is possible to undertake development\n            activities in conflict-affected districts, if implementation\n            is done by beneficiaries and community groups, use of\n            project funds is transparent, and neutral social mobilizers\n            are hired to facilitate project implementation. DTMPs should\n            include all priority rural transport infrastructure,\n            including new construction, upgrading, rehabilitation and\n            maintenance. Appropriate environmental assessment should be\n            carried out for all sub-projects involving rehabilitation/upgrading."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Rural Infrastructure
