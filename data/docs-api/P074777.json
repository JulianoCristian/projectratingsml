Some lessons learned included:  the\n            participation of key political and technical actors at\n            project design is helpful to ensure priorities are correctly\n            defined and to promote ownership. This administratively\n            difficult project ran relatively smoothly after the initial\n            delays. The lack of major problems during implementation\n            despite high political turnover at Ministry of Social\n            Security (MPS) and the strong participation by\n            municipalities in the exercises and training financed by\n            PREVMUN reflects the high sense of ownership. Projects\n            combining technical assistance to federal and municipal\n            governments whose election cycles are not aligned will\n            benefit from planning the implementation timing to avoid\n            electoral periods. This could be achieved by starting after\n            municipal elections, or from presenting plans for mitigating\n            their potential effect as much as possible. Also, other\n            political factors such as the risk of needing political\n            actions outside the effective control of the implementation\n            team (as the decree requiring pension management units to\n            report the information using the Integrated Pension\n            Information System (SIPREV) format) need to be looked at\n            carefully. Relatively small operations at the federal level\n            in Brazil absorb a relatively high amount of effort and\n            supervision budget. However, this is partially because the\n            Bank's rules and regulations require the same due\n            diligence irrespective of loan amount. When needed for\n            strategic reasons such as the social security reform at the\n            time of the preparation of PREVMUN the Bank could consider\n            simplifying procedures so that large and small loans are\n            treated differently, thereby supporting the viability of\n            smaller loans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
