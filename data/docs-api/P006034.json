The main goals--increasing revenues\n            through more efficient tax administration, combined with\n            ensuring their sustainability--were in fact adequately\n            fulfilled. Project sustainability is rated as likely. World\n            Bank performance is rated satisfactory, while Borrower\n            performance in project implementation and operation is\n            judged to have been less than satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include the following: In undertaking the requirement in\n            this case for achieving substantial institutional reform, it\n            would have been far better to have employed an APL-type\n            (Adaptable Program Lending) approach had this been\n            available. This might have produced superior results in\n            maintaining strong high level Borrower commitment, affording\n            possibilities of providing greater Bank funding, and coping\n            with the changing economic/political tides over an extended\n            period. Another lesson underscores the importance of\n            safeguarding tax bureaus from disruptive political forces\n            because of their importance for fiscal governance and\n            efficient state operations. The officials sought to inject\n            greater stability in managing the tax program by\n            guaranteeing its chief administrator a multi-year term of\n            office and strengthening the institution's political\n            independence. Finally, in uncertain climates, special\n            provisions should be made to extend the authority of project\n            leadership, taking into account that conditions in which\n            project leadership changes cause project delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
