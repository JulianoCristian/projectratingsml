Regardless of satisfactory\n            outcomes, lessons suggest a balanced approach between the\n            complexity of the sector, and the variety of stakeholders,\n            because the broad scope of the project, led to the inclusion\n            of too many components, whereas priority implementation\n            strategies should have been identified, and agreed upon\n            early on. Thus, on designing a judicial reform project, the\n            use of sociopolitical institutional assessments should be a\n            powerful tool for assessing alternative reform options, and\n            include the appropriate implementation strategies.\n            Furthermore, coordination has political dimensions that do\n            not respond well to technical, or managerial solutions, nor\n            to weak institutional capacity, thus the persistent lack of\n            committed coordination between the Judiciary, and the\n            Ministry of Justice hindered stronger results, and perhaps\n            prevented flexible judicial reform strategies, critical for\n            a project to survive recurrent crisis in the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Judicial
