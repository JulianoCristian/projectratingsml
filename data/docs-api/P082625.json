Some lessons\n            learned included: the project attempted to address a broad\n            range of multi-sectoral issues ranging from cultural\n            heritage preservation to regional development and provision\n            of basic infrastructure services. Addressing this complex\n            range of themes required multiple institutions and large\n            teams on both the Bank and the Government side.\n            Participatory processes only contributed to the excessive\n            scope and complexity of the original design. Some activities\n            required coordination among several institutions at\n            different government level, such as the revisions and\n            approvals of the feasibility studies. Poor\n            inter-institutional coordination and communication created\n            delays and often contradicting messages to the consultant.\n            The Bank team supported intensive training in procurement\n            and financial management but this was not done early enough\n            in the project cycle and resulted in large delays in\n            disbursements. The decision to prior review all contracts\n            adopted during the restructuring reduced procurement risk\n            but also created substantial delays for the Borrower while\n            waiting for Bank no objections."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Vilcanota Valley Rehabilitation and\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Vilcanota Valley\n

and ecological assets in the Vilcanota\n            Valley, including the historical sanctuary of Machu Picchu\n            (HSMP) and the Sacred Valley of the Incas. This will involve\n            the preparation and execution of minor infrastructure works,\n            capacity building and institutional strengthening actions at\n            various levels of government, and the undertaking of careful\n            studies on key social and environmental issues, with a\n            particular emphasis on disaster management and risk\n            reduction. This project has been resubmitted to the Board\n            for restructuring. Bank safeguard policy OP 4.10, on\n            Indigenous Peoples, has been triggered as part of the\n            restructuring. As indigenous communities are determined to\n            constitute the majority of project beneficiaries, the\n            policy's more rigorous standards of stakeholder\n            engagement and respect for local cultures will apply to the\n            project as a whole.

and Management Project, is\n            to support the Government's efforts to enhance the\n            environmental and socio-economic sustainability of\n            historical, cultural, and ecological assets in the Vilcanota\n            Valley, including the historical sanctuary of Machu Picchu\n            (HSMP) and the Sacred Valley of the Incas. This will require\n            infrastructure works, namely access roads, water supply and\n            sanitation, and construction of tourist areas requiring\n            visitor centers, rehabilitation of archaeological sites, and\n            telecommunications centers. This project has been\n            resubmitted to the Board for restructuring. This document\n            discusses environmental and social management of the\n            Restructured Project. The environmental assessment (EA)\n            comprises 4 volumes that contain environmental management\n            guidelines (V. 1) summarizing the project background;\n            guidelines for minor infrastructure works (V. 2) outlining\n            the environmental policy framework and legislation, and, the\n            proposed mitigation for infrastructure works under\n            environmental categories A, B, or C, including basic\n            procedural manuals; and, guidelines for the environmental\n            assessment on the construction of sanitary landfills (V. 3).\n            This document is V. 4 and replaces V. 1. Under the\n            Restructured Project, the EA of the Project will be updated\n            to reflect changes such as the fact that sanitary landfills\n            will not be constructed. Instead there will be a study on\n            solid waste options for the Valley. Training programs shall\n            be conducted taking into account the socioeconomic\n            conditions of local communities. Work safety guidelines are\n            included in V. 2."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental and social management of the\n            restructured Vilcanota Valley Rehabilitation Project :\n            safeguard excerpts from the project paper"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Vilcanota Valley\n            Rehabilitation and Management Project : environmental\n            assessment (Vol. 5) : Environmental and social management of\n            the restructured Vilcanota Valley Rehabilitation Project :\n            safeguard excerpts from the project paper"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/10/9976765/peru-vilcanota-valley-rehabilitation-management-project-environmental-assessment-vol-5-environmental-social-management-restructured-vilcanota-valley-rehabilitation-project-safeguard-excerpts-project-paper","projn":"PE-Vilcanota Valley Rehabilitation And\n            Management Project -- P082625","subtopic":"Cultural Policy,Banks & Banking Reform,Social Accountability,Housing & Human Habitats,Cultural Heritage & Preservation","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Culture and Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","count":"Peru","authors":{"authr":"Agusti, Fiorela"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20081029001545"},"subsc":"Flood protection,Sub-national government administration,Solid waste management","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Culture and Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Social Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental management;
