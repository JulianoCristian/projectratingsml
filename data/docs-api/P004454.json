Some 8,500 families, most of whom are below the\n            poverty line, would benefit directly from the increased\n            production and subsequent employment. The road component is\n            tentatively expected to improve access for some 78,000\n            families by linking relatively isolated villages to the\n            mainstream of economic life of the provinces. About 47,000\n            poverty level families would benefit from the health\n            facilities to be provided under the project, while the 300\n            village wells would improve the availability and quality of\n            water for some 100,000 families."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - First Rural Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - First Rural\n            Infrastructure Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/03/726943/philippines-first-rural-infrastructure-project","projn":"PH-Rural Infrastructure-268525 -- P004454","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Drylands & Desertification,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912375985"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,agrarian reform,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            land,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,agricultural\n            productivity,Agriculture,Asian Development Bank,average\n            annual rainfall,average yields,clay loam,clay\n            soils,Clays,coconut,coconuts,coffee,commodity,community\n            participation,corn,crop,crop damage,crop\n            production,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,crops,drainage,drinking water,dry\n            season,equipment,export crops,extension\n            services,FAO,Farm,farm income,FARM INCOMES,farm\n            produce,Farmers,Farming,farms,feasibility\n            studies,Fertilizer,food crops,forestry,Grain,grain\n            production,health care,integration,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Systems,Land Tenure,lands,loam soils,local\n            governments,migration,mountain\n            slopes,nutrition,paddy,plains,population growth,population\n            growth rates,Rice,rice crop,rice cultivation,Rice\n            Production,Rice yields,rural areas,rural communities,Rural\n            Development,rural income,Rural Infrastructure,rural\n            population,rural roads,small farmers,Soil,soil\n            types,Soils,spring,standards of\n            living,sugar,sugarcane,supervision,temperature,Transport,Transportation,upland\n            rice,urbanization,USAID,vegetables,water resources,Water Supply,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,agrarian reform,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            land,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,agricultural\n            productivity,Agriculture,Asian Development Bank,average\n            annual rainfall,average yields,clay loam,clay\n            soils,Clays,coconut,coconuts,coffee,commodity,community\n            participation,corn,crop,crop damage,crop\n            production,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,crops,drainage,drinking water,dry\n            season,equipment,export crops,extension\n            services,FAO,Farm,farm income,FARM INCOMES,farm\n            produce,Farmers,Farming,farms,feasibility\n            studies,Fertilizer,food crops,forestry,Grain,grain\n            production,health care,integration,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Systems,Land Tenure,lands,loam soils,local\n            governments,migration,mountain\n            slopes,nutrition,paddy,plains,population growth,population\n            growth rates,Rice,rice crop,rice cultivation,Rice\n            Production,Rice yields,rural areas,rural communities,Rural\n            Development,rural income,Rural Infrastructure,rural\n            population,rural roads,small farmers,Soil,soil\n            types,Soils,spring,standards of\n            living,sugar,sugarcane,supervision,temperature,Transport,Transportation,upland\n            rice,urbanization,USAID,vegetables,water resources,Water Supply,wells"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"1884"},"facets":{}}}
