The\n            lessons learned indicate that deforestation did clearly not\n            decline in either state, and socio-economic development\n            advanced less than expected. The objective of the projects\n            was to change behavior of private and public agents in the\n            use of the natural resources of tropical rain forests. The\n            three main instruments to bring this about, synergistically,\n            were zoning (a restriction on land use), the promotion of\n            intensified land use and the provision of infrastructure and\n            services in areas already cleared, and the creation and\n            protection of reserved areas. The project concept did not\n            recognize the strong existing economic and political forces\n            that were (and still are) working in favor of continued\n            expansion of forest clearing - the \"political\n            economy\" of the frontier states. Despite all the merits\n            of decentralization, it may have been premature to turn over\n            the sensitive issue of land use entirely to the states. On\n            the other hand, creation of a \"coherent incentives\n            framework for sustainable development\" was expected\n            (almost) only from the states, but should have required\n            adjustments to federal policies and programs as well, which\n            were not the focus of project preparation. At the risk of\n            undue simplification, the Bank had a strong interest in the\n            environmental objectives of the projects, in the aftermath\n            of POLONOROESTE, but saw development - in the right places -\n            as part of an overall strategy. In spite of formally\n            approved initial zoning laws, there was no sufficiently deep\n            commitment on the part of the states' society to be\n            bound by the provisions of (first approximation) zoning.\n            Refined (second approximation) zoning came too late to\n            change such commitment, and is not binding yet in either\n            state. Other, non-coercive instruments of \"getting the\n            zoning plan implemented\" were not devised. The\n            sustainability of project results remains highly\n            questionable, not only because appropriate arrangements were\n            absent, but even more importantly because the thrust of the\n            projects was, and likely still is, not in line with the\n            local mainstream. The project reformulation after the\n            mid-term review did not address the principal shortcomings\n            of the original projects. They accommodated one part of\n            society (\"organized civil society\"), but not\n            private sector interests, on the basis of a vague strategy\n            of community-driven development, largely without any solid\n            and proven natural resource management technologies that\n            would have reverted the mainstream use (clearing) of rain forests."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Mato Grosso Natural Resources\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Mato Grosso Natural\n            Resources Management

The project will assist the Government to: (a)\n            support changes in policies, regulations, and investment\n            programs, to provide a coherent incentives framework for the\n            sustainable development of Mato Grosso; (b) guarantee\n            conservation of the rich biodiversity of the state, while\n            creating the basis for sustainable utilization of its\n            renewable natural resources for direct economic benefit of\n            the local population; (c) develop integrated agro-forestry\n            farming systems in areas suitable for permanent agriculture;\n            and (d) consolidate the technical operational capacity of\n            state institutions, particularly those responsible for\n            management of natural resources support services, the\n            protection and management of forests and indigenous\n            reserves, and agricultural services.

The project will assist the Government to: (a)\n            support changes in policies, regulations, and investment\n            programs, to provide a coherent incentives framework for the\n            sustainable development of Mato Grosso; (b) guarantee\n            conservation of the rich biodiversity of the state, while\n            creating the basis for sustainable utilization of its\n            renewable natural resources for direct economic benefit of\n            the local population; (c) develop integrated agro-forestry\n            farming systems in areas suitable for permanent agriculture;\n            and (d) consolidate the technical operational capacity of\n            state institutions, particularly those responsible for\n            management of natural resources support services, the\n            protection and management of forests and indigenous\n            reserves, and agricultural services.  The main impact of the\n            project will be a significant reduction in the rate of\n            destruction of Mato Grosso's remaining natural rain\n            forest and effective
