Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, it is important to\n            establish a procurement plan and schedule that is compatible\n            with the overall project schedule. Pre-qualification of\n            local contractors and preparation of well-defined equipment\n            specifications would be helpful in achieving project\n            schedule and quality objectives. Second, it is important to\n            establish a realistic implementation schedule in order to\n            avoid the danger of underestimating costs and overestimating\n            benefits. Also, a realistic schedule will eliminate the\n            unnecessary expenditure of administrative time to negotiate\n            and approve loan extensions. Lastly, co-financing represents\n            a significant source of external funds for energy projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fifth Sui Northern Gas Pipeline
