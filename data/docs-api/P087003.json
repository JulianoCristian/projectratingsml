Some lessons learned included: a\n            regional HIV/AIDS strategy will provide the strategic\n            framework for a regional HIV/AIDS project to support. For\n            this reason, ideally, a regional HIV/AIDS strategy should\n            have been formulated during project preparation or at least\n            during the early phase of project effectiveness to guide the\n            project implementation. Unfortunately, the regional HIV/AIDS\n            strategy was not developed and adopted until October 2009,\n            which was one year after Mid-Term Review (MTR). Risks\n            potentially compromising implementation, including political\n            economy, institutional/implementation arrangements, and\n            fiduciary risks should be realistically assessed and\n            properly mitigated at the outset. This is even more crucial\n            for novel and complex projects facing challenging\n            environments with new institutions and various conflicting\n            interests. Although the project in many respects was\n            exemplary in its inherent relevance to Bank policies and\n            country strategies, it proved once again the need for: (i)\n            objectives and performance indicators to be carefully\n            selected; (ii) an adequately designed monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) system to be in place at the start of\n            implementation; and (iii) appropriate arrangements to be in\n            place to ensure that information is used strategically for\n            decision making. The risks associated with this project were\n            underestimated at appraisal. The right composition of a task\n            team, including specialized public health and\n            epidemiological skills for HIV/AIDS projects and strong\n            operational skills, is required to supervise complex\n            projects in challenging environments. Such skills should be\n            a key feature identified during project preparation and\n            presented in supervision plans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central Asia - AIDS Control
