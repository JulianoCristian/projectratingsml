Some lessons learned included: the built-in\n            flexibility and indicative policy targets included in the\n            memorandum of economic reform policies (MERP), coupled with\n            strong technical support for both the import and policy\n            components, have contributed to the successful\n            implementation of the loan with the prerequisite of a strong\n            and sustained government commitment to a well-defined reform\n            agenda. The appointment of procurement advisors who provided\n            overall project management support was very important for\n            the success of an operation in a new borrowing country; the\n            role of advisors should also stress responsibility for\n            training local counterparts. Higher than average resources\n            are needed when working with new borrowers and in loans that\n            include policy components; the flexible design and the list\n            of agreed imports increased supervision costs; however, the\n            benefits reaped in terms of imports acceptable to the\n            government, and building sectoral dialogue were substantial."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Estonia -
