The\n            first objective was to support the National Economic\n            Recovery Plan strategy for ameliorating the adverse impacts\n            of the economic crisis on the poor and vulnerable by\n            maintaining their welfare and access to essential social\n            services, particularly by those groups located in the\n            poorest districts. The second objective was to strengthen\n            the monitoring of poverty over time as well as of the\n            effectiveness of programs designed to reduce poverty and to\n            mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis, particularly\n            those supported by the project. The Government of Malaysia\n            (GOM) requested cancellation of the Loan in April 2000,\n            explaining that project complexity and lack of familiarity\n            with Bank procedures (e.g., procurement) at district level\n            caused poor project performance, and noting that the GOM\n            would use government funding for implementation of project\n            activities. World Bank management agreed with the GOM's\n            request and cancelled the Loan on April 19, 2000. The\n            reasons behind the request for cancellation stem from a\n            variety of factors. The Economic Recovery and Social Sector\n            Loan (ERSL) that had been approved at the onset of the\n            crisis was disbursed as a single tranche on the same day of\n            Effectiveness. However, after ERSL approval, no fast\n            disbursing loans were envisaged under the World Bank's\n            three year lending program that was proposed in the March\n            1999 CAS, and instead the above mentioned three sector\n            investment loans comprised the lending package. It may be\n            noteworthy that the design of the SSSP operation as a sector\n            investment loan, and in particular procurement planning and\n            compliance with Bank procurement procedures, caused\n            significant delays in project implementation. Perhaps\n            simpler approaches could have been adopted. These delays\n            were coupled with the issue surrounding the GOM's\n            request to cancel the Poverty Component. These combined\n            factors help explain the reasoning behind the\n            Government's decision to cancel the Loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia - Social Sector Support

the adverse impacts of the economic crisis\n            on the poor and vulnerable by maintaining their welfare and\n            access to essential social services; and b) strengthen the\n            monitoring of poverty over time as well as of the\n            effectiveness of programs designed to reduce poverty and to\n            mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis. There are four\n            components. 1) Rural development and poverty alleviation\n            will finance the Poverty Village Development Program which\n            will construct community facilities in preschool education,\n            functional literacy, counseling, and skill training. The\n            component will also support the Early Childhood Education\n            Program by building pre-school centers, etc. 2) Health\n            clinic will maintain provision of essential health services\n            for lower income groups during the current crisis. Rural\n            community clinics and urban health clinics will be\n            constructed and equipped. 3) Social assistance for\n            disadvantaged groups will support the refurbishment and\n            equipping of some existing construction and new\n            kindergartens for poor children, and support training of\n            their teachers. 4) Poverty monitoring and impact assessment\n            will finance an Household Income Survey, an impact\n            assessment of selected anti-poverty programs; and\n            beneficiary assessments to monitor the impact of
