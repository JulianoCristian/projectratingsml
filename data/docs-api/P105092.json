One of the lessons learned\n            under this project is the need to effectively utilize\n            limited funding of inputs and incentives for volunteers to\n            deliver community-based services given the overall high cost\n            of providing incentives to such a large cadre of people.\n            While as the financial inputs on their own were found to be\n            insufficient by most volunteers, examples of more effective\n            use of these funds and other incentives was seen across\n            districts and communities such as the enrollment of\n            volunteers into the National Health Insurance Schemes, the\n            exemption from communal activities and levies and priority\n            treatment at health facilities. The initial implementation\n            arrangements for the project constrained its progress. The\n            restructuring greatly improved the management arrangements\n            and helped move the project forward. Because of the\n            implementation constraints, the task team moved the\n            anticipated date for the mid-term review forward in order to\n            get to the restructuring earlier. Proactive supervision\n            clearly led to improved project performance. In hindsight,\n            this restructuring could even have been done earlier. It\n            should be mentioned that while the addition of a sub-metro\n            areas of Accra and Kumasi in the Great Accra and Ashanti\n            regions to the project was done especially to draw on\n            lessons learned based on implementation in urban settings,\n            late implementation of community-based health and nutrition\n            services in these areas means that such lessons have still\n            not been identified at this time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
