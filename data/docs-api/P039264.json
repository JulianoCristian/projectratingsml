Among the many lessons\n            learned, the following are highlighted. Building on existing\n            community, and government structures and processes, made it\n            feasible to complement explicit measures, and ensure that\n            the institutions function in an effective, inclusive, and\n            particular manner. However, clear mechanisms and incentives,\n            need to be established up-front to facilitate the\n            achievement of the less visible objectives of institutional\n            development, and sustainability, i.e., the trade-offs\n            between the physical, and more qualitative output targets,\n            need to be confronted in the project design, and the\n            hierarchy of objectives be defined, and established early\n            on. It is emphasized that community-based projects can\n            contribute to Eritrea's broader efforts to decentralize\n            the provision of public goods, and services to local\n            governments, in a way that also helps local governments\n            fight poverty, through continuous training and capacity\n            building activities. Nonetheless, development impacts could\n            be further maximized, by integrating interventions to\n            complementary inputs, that is for example, health clinics\n            could have yielded optimal outcomes, had design and\n            implementation of investments been integrated, and better\n            coordinated. But is fair to say that, despite initial\n            shortcomings, the commitment, continuity, and pragmatic\n            approach of the Eritrea Community Development Fund staff,\n            were contributing factors to bridge differences, and enhance effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea -

The ECDF will not implement projects,\n            but will support and facilitate the efforts of local\n            communities and will ensure the provision of technical\n            expertise in project implementation and management wherever\n            the community needs. The implementation of the\n            rehabilitation works will be carried out in a decentralized,\n            pragmatic, and flexible way, and will give a large\n            responsibility to the community for preparation and supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea -
