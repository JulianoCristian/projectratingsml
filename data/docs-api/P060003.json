On May 16, 2006, Management submitted its report\n            and recommendations in response to the inspection\n            panel's Investigation report. Since the project closed\n            before the inspection panel report was completed, no\n            project-specific actions were possible. Management's\n            action plan therefore acknowledged the inherent and\n            continuing challenges to increasing public participation in\n            the forest sector in Cambodia, and laid out a strategic and\n            forward-looking agenda to support the development of a more\n            equitable and socially-inclusive approach to natural\n            resources management. The Management action plan included\n            specific actions to be taken at two levels: (a) across the\n            Bank to mainstream improvements in environmental screening\n            and classification and to expand the use of strategic\n            environmental assessment with targeted training to\n            familiarize Bank staff with these tools; and (b) by the\n            within the region (EAP) to complete: (1) community\n            consultation guidelines; and (2) the legal and regulatory\n            framework for indigenous peoples' land rights in\n            Cambodia. Recognizing that a sustained effort will be\n            required, the management action plan also included a section\n            outlining a phased approach to building a broad consensus\n            with Government and other development partners on the way\n            forward in the forestry sector. The present report follows\n            the structure of the original action plan, detailing recent\n            progress and challenges in the text and summarizing progress\n            since June

Since the project closed before the Inspection\n            Panel Report was completed, no project-specific actions were\n            possible.

Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            include the following: in the future, the use of learning\n            instrument loans (LILs) or any instrument that circumvents\n            any of the usual safeguard investigation during preparation\n            should be subject not only to the normal tests of\n            eligibility, but also the test o f downside risks, be these\n            technical or the likelihood of adverse public opinion; where\n            the client is not familiar with Bank operations and\n            procedures or is confronting serious impediments to its\n            ability to act on that knowledge, continuous presence of\n            competent Bank representatives is a critical factor in\n            moving dialogue and operations forward; when ambiguity or\n            disagreements arise in implementation, particularly with the\n            evolving focus or importance of an activity, an agreed\n            strategy can become an effective management tool;\n            institutions generally respond more favorably to moderate or\n            gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when\n            power or stature are being threatened;

Some lessons learned\n            included: (a) The project design was based on optimistic\n            views of the speed with which the Borrower's\n            performance could be enhanced; (b) The

     lead to rapid improvements in practical capacity in the\n            field for forest managers was overestimated; (e) The\n            problems of working with a borrower agency whose staff did\n            not have appropriate incentives to pursue project goals were\n            under-estimated; (f) The difficulties of applying learning\n            or introducing innovations in a LIL of this type were\n            under-estimated; and (g) The situation can improve only if\n            countries develop broad-based participatory institutions\n            that offer equal voice to local

Since the project closed before the Inspection\n            Panel Report was completed, no project-specific actions were\n            possible. Management's Action Plan took a pragmatic\n            approach, however, recognizing the inherent and ongoing\n            challenges to increasing public participation in the forest\n            sector in Cambodia while at the same time laying out a\n            strategic and forward looking agenda for dialogue and\n            exploration of new approaches to develop more equitable and\n            socially responsible natural resources management.

The Request for\n            Inspection was submitted by the NGO Forum o f Cambodia\n            acting on its own behalf and on behalf of affected local\n            communities living in the districts of Tbeng Meanchey in\n            Preah Vihear Province; Siem Bok and Sesan in Stung Treng\n            Province; and Anlong Veng in Oddar Meanchey Province,\n            Cambodia (the \"Requesters\"). Challenges to the\n            project were focused on two key objectives: concessional\n            planning and management, and forest crime monitoring and\n            prevention. The Panel's findings, along with\n            Management's responses, are described in detail in\n            Annex 1. Management concludes that the Bank made every\n            effort to apply its policies and procedures to pursue its\n            mission statement in the context of the project; and\n            specifically addresses the issues identified in Panel's\n            Report in the section on Lessons learned and the proposed\n            Action Plan. Among the specific actions it cites are\n            proposals for: 1) reviewing and updating the\n            \"Guidelines for Environmental Screening and\n            Classification\" to provide additional guidance on\n            classification and appropriate methods o f undertaking\n            environmental and social safeguard related actions in\n            technical assistance projects; 2) promoting the use of\n            Strategic Environmental Assessments and related\n            methodologies to help prepare and implement selected natural\n            resources management projects to provide more information on\n            baseline environmental and social trends and conditions; 3)\n            taking steps to ensure that approaches, such as landscape\n            level biodiversity management, best management practices for\n            Protected Areas, and information-sharing are introduced in\n            future projects o f this type; 4) supporting the\n            finalization of the draft Community Consultation Guidelines\n            in Cambodia; and ensuring that the Guidelines explicitly\n            include a reference to the legal framework in Cambodia and\n            provide guidance regarding the appropriate authorities to\n            inform when \"chance finds\" occur; and 5)\n            recognizing the urgency of securing land and resource rights\n            for Indigenous Peoples in order to make a strong and\n            immediate effort to collaborate with other donors and\n            Government under the Technical Working group for Land, to\n            finalize, as a matter o f priority, the legal and enabling\n            implementing procedures required for making the provisions\n            of the Land Law a reality for indigenous communities in Cambodia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -

The Panel found the following: In the\n            project's focus on concessions, the Bank ignored or at\n            least marginalized other aspects important to the Bank\n            program in Cambodia and to the Government during the\n            planning process. The project did not give adequate\n            attention to vital interests of local communities and\n            indigenous peoples in forest resources, and to the contested\n            nature of forest domain. Rather the Bank gave primary\n            emphasis in project design to the technical and financial\n            aspects of concession reform at the expense of environmental\n            and social aspects. The Panel also expressed concern, that\n            certain parts of the guidelines about the concession review\n            process developed under the project do not meet Bank\n            safeguard policy requirements ad do not provide adequate\n            framework for the Government to decide on any future\n            forestry concessions. Unless this is remedied, the project\n            will not achieve one of its main objectives to demonstrate\n            and improve effectiveness of comprehensive forest management\n            and operational guidelines in the forest concession area.\n            The panel also addressed the choice of the Learning\n            Innovation Loan (LIL) as a financing instrument;\n            identification and protection of forests of high ecological\n            value, of natural habitats, of the affected population and\n            the project area, and of cultural property (spirit forests\n            and archeological sites); the need for an environmental\n            assessment, the project's environmental categorization;\n            the need for a social assessment; impacts on local people of\n            illegal logging of resin trees; consultations with affected\n            people during project preparation; preparation of an\n            indigenous peoples development plan; technical assistance\n            that was provided; and the adequacy of Strategic Forest\n            Management Plans (SFMP) and Environmental and Social Impact\n            Assessments (ESIA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -
