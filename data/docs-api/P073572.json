The\n            overall rating for all the four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            rating, and also the performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower for all four projects is rated as satisfactory. The\n            main lessons learned from this review are: (i) as noted in\n            Independent Evaluation Group (IEG's) ICR Review of\n            Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL III), project\n            design needs to be clearly aligned with its development\n            objectives in order to attain the latter. Even if the\n            structural deficit of the central administration is\n            \"highly sensitive and political\" as the ICR\n            states, the magnitudes of these structural rigidities were\n            such that they must be addressed if progress is to be made\n            in achieving the substantial fiscal adjustment that is\n            required for sustained macroeconomic stability; (ii) loans\n            with large numbers of objectives and conditions, and\n            involving too many institutions relative to the management\n            capacity of the Government and the Bank itself, overtax the\n            implementation capacity of both the Bank and the borrower\n            and result in poor execution; (iii) the inclusion of\n            objectives of widely different levels of priority and weak\n            connection with the ultimate goals of the operations tends\n            to obscure the degree of attainment of the latter; and (iv)\n            success depends on the borrower's ownership of the\n            objectives of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal Adjustment; and\n            First, Second,

- Structural Fiscal Adjustment Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was modest,\n            and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The SFAL was designed to support a fiscal\n            reform agenda developed by the Colombian government.\n            Ownership of the reforms was a critical element for the\n            success of the program, ensuring the necessary coordination\n            and long-term commitment to the process. This commitment was\n            even more important given that project implementation\n            spanned two government administrations. The risk that the\n            reform agenda would be marginalized by the new\n            administration was identified in the project document.\n            However, the Uribe administration understood the importance\n            of reform and maintained government commitment to the\n            program. While many of the reforms supported by the SFAL\n            have not been completed during the period of the loan, they\n            have advanced substantially. In the case of the ISS, the\n            SFAL did not fully achieve its goal of developing a\n            sustainable model for the institution. A longer loan period\n            would have provided the on-going support necessary to\n            achieve more progress in this area. Alternatively,\n            subsequent programmatic loans such as the Fiscal\n            Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL) I and II could have\n            continued to support reform in this area, but the issue has\n            not been addressed in these subsequent loans. Certain\n            elements of the program were based on quantitative fiscal\n            targets. These targets suffered from two problems given the\n            short-term nature of the loan. Firstly, tranche releases\n            were based on mid-year expenditure figures. As in many\n            countries, spending is back-loaded towards the end of the\n            year, which means that low apparent expenditure at mid-year\n            eventually disappears by year-end. This was the case during\n            the SFAL for Colombia-actual expenditures during the second\n            half of the year were much higher than during the first half\n            of the year. Secondly, conditions in the program used\n            initially budgeted figures rather than actual expenditures.\n            As is often the case, actual expenditures vary considerably\n            when compared with the original budget. Indeed, during the\n            period of the SFAL program there were sizable upward\n            adjustments to initially proposed budgets during the second\n            half of the year."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal Adjustment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal\n            Adjustment

 policies that can strengthen the country's fiscal\n            outlook. This policy package involves a) rationalizing the\n            system of transfers to local governments, and imposing more\n            market-driven and more binding budget constraints on their\n            finances; b) establishing mechanisms to arrest the exploding\n            cost of inefficiency in the provision of public health\n            services; c) halting the accumulation of pension-related\n            contingent liabilities; d) advancing the reorganization of\n            public agencies and their current expenditures; and e)\n            setting up a better system for managing public debt. The\n            combination of measures to improve governmental fiscal\n            relations, rationalize public sector expenditures, and\n            improve financial management of the public sector's\n            assets and liabilities will lead to a more sustainable\n            fiscal path and to greater efficiency in allocation of\n            public resources, including those allocated to the social\n            sectors. Both are necessary to sustain economic growth and\n            poverty reduction efforts, and to improve the provision of\n            key public services. The loan will help to implement fiscal\n            reforms, provide a confidence-building signal to\n            international markets, reduce the cost of borrowing, and\n            lengthen debt maturity. These will in turn grant the\n            government the fiscal space for protecting social sector\n            expenditures and implementing difficult structural measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal\n            Adjustment Loan
