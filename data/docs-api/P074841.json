Some lessons learned included:\n            complex challenges, such as child nutrition, is beyond the\n            scope of the health sector by itself and requires a\n            multi-sectoral approach. The World Bank can play a role in\n            convening development partners and to ensure that the\n            evidence is shared across different sectors, in much the\n            same way that was done with human immunodeficiency virus\n            (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the\n            three ones approach. Not having a clear development\n            objective can impact negatively on implementation and\n            results. The lack of intervention-level evaluations limits\n            the program\u0092s flexibility and responsiveness. While\n            monitoring and evaluation is important for accountability,\n            it can also help to understand what works well in the\n            program and what needs to be modified. Having a\n            well-designed results framework is important for planning\n            and monitoring. Without a structure for partners and the\n            government to design, debate, and evaluate new policy, it\n            seems unlikely that there will be structural reform in the\n            future. It also requires development partners to strengthen\n            their understanding of political economy and to develop\n            strategies to gradually expand their dialogue. At the same\n            time, the government needs to identify its priorities and\n            openly discuss its political limitations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Health, Nutrition, and\n

Bangladesh\n            were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: ensuring\n            commitment and maintaining policy dialogue with key\n            ministries beyond the health ministry, e.g. Ministry of\n            Finance (MOF) and ministries responsible for\n            decentralization and civil service reform is very important\n            for achieving improvements in health. It necessitates a very\n            good partnership and a sensitive approach to fully\n            understand the complexities of government commitment,\n            including ensuring the commitment and incentives for the\n            lower levels of government. Understanding the political\n            economy, not least for complex countries like Bangladesh, is\n            important. More flexibility from Development Partners (DPs)\n            to adapt to changing national priorities will help resolve\n            any disagreements that may arise while implementing the\n            project. Performance based funding is challenging, both in\n            terms of identifying appropriate indicators and targets, and\n            also in terms of understanding whether the incentives it\n            provides can be expected to yield the desired results. The\n            overall incentive structure of the system, and not least the\n            specific incentives of the unit responsible for achieving\n            the target, need to be thoroughly analyzed. Establishing new\n            entities within a government system, with rules and\n            regulations different from those of government, is very\n            difficult. Such initiatives should not only be discussed and\n            agreed upon at the highest level of the Government but also\n            with the actual implementers to ensure buy-in from all\n            levels of the Government and that proposed reforms are\n            feasible. For large sector programs like HNPSP, which rely\n            on Government's Financial Management (FM) system,\n            specific systems strengthening component will have mitigated\n            some of the issues emanating from weak fiduciary capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Health, Nutrition, and\n            Population Sector Program
