Lessons learned included: (1)\n            any new operation should keep the vision of a long-term\n            strategic framework provided by the Master Plan. Planning\n            instruments for the long-term management of protected areas\n            must be clearly articulated to national development plans\n            and agendas in order to incorporate sustainable biodiversity\n            management as a key element for national and local\n            development; (2) although the establishment and operation of\n            the protected areas trust fund through the Foundation for\n            the Development of the National System of Protected Areas\n            has met the project goals, the National System of Protected\n            Areas (SNAP)'s financial sustainability is still an\n            important bottleneck on Bolivia's protected areas\n            management. At project's closing, the majority of\n            funding was still coming from international donors; (3) the\n            implementation of the Master Plan in a next phase should\n            give priority to the following aspects: i) supporting\n            institutional development at various levels (national,\n            departmental and municipal); (ii) supporting administrative\n            decentralization without hindering the development of the\n            central government; (iii) respecting Bolivia's\n            particular cultural and ethnic diversity; (iv) ensure that\n            conservation and sustainable use initiatives result in local\n            benefits, and (v) relate natural resource management to\n            rural development; (4) sustainable biodiversity and natural\n            resources management models for protected areas and their\n            buffer zones were developed and implemented by communities\n            with assistance from the National Protected Areas Service;\n            (5) the participatory process of preparation of the\n            protected areas management plans was not sufficient, by\n            itself, to secure the ownership and full understanding of\n            the proposed conservation strategies by stakeholders; (6)\n            the project did not succeed in taking all the steps needed\n            to articulate, measure and inform the Management Committees\n            and other stakeholders regarding the indicators of\n            biodiversity and of the current and projected future\n            resource use patterns by communities in each Protected Area;\n            and (7) the success of the project depended greatly on the\n            continuity of the project technical staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -

There are\n            five project components. The first aims to strengthen the\n            regulatory agency's policy, planning, and management\n            capacities, and its ability to operate autonomously. The\n            second component aims to strenthen the planning and\n            managment capacities of the protected areas, and increase\n            local participation and inter-institutional coordination.\n            The third component prepares and approves the Protected\n            Areas law, and amends cross-sectoral laws and regulations.\n            The fourth component establishes and capitalizes a dedicated\n            trust fund to provide recurrent cost financing for protected\n            areas.
