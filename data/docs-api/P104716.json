Some lessons learned included:\n            government commitment for reforms secured early i.e. during\n            project conceptualization is critical to successful\n            implementation of institutional reforms. Free standing\n            grants to support projects should be planned with similar\n            objectives, project activities, and implementing\n            arrangements in order to provide flexibility and efficiency\n            in the use of funds. The failure to deliver the entire\n            planned water system provides a good example of the inherent\n            risk in having different funding sources delivering\n            different components. Splitting up interdependent systems\n            into separate packages to be financed by a single financing\n            source is therefore critical for a satisfactory outcome and\n            to avoid mismatched implementation schedules.
