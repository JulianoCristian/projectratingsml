and,\n            both Bank and Borrower performances are downgraded to\n            unsatisfactory from satisfactory by the ICR and ICR review.\n            However, ratings on the National Drainage Project fully\n            concur on satisfactory project outcomes, likely\n            sustainability, substantial institutional development\n            impacts, and satisfactory Bank and Borrower performances.\n            Experiences offer two lessons. First, it is reinforced that\n            disbursement, and physical achievements are not always good\n            indicators of project success, aggravated if failure to\n            address systemic institutional problems, adversely affect\n            operational efficiency and sustainability of project works,\n            making lending ineffective. This not only hampers the\n            Bank's reform agenda, but causes also concern among the\n            Bank's development partners, who see the Bank as the\n            interlocutor capable of advancing institutional, and policy\n            reforms with the Government of Egypt. Second, it should be\n            taken into consideration the fact that in-country Bank\n            partnership with bilateral development agencies, is a\n            powerful instrument for institutional reform, who develop\n            long-term institution-building relationships with government\n            in specific sectors, potentially, and significantly\n            increasing the utility, relevance, and leverage of Bank\n            assistance. In Egypt, bilateral agencies bring differing\n            perspectives to the water, and agriculture sub-sector, and\n            are notably strong at capacity building in drainage, and\n            community development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second Pumping Stations\n            Rehabilitation and National Drainage Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Second Pumping Stations\n            Rehabilitation and National Drainage Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/02/3038115/egypt-second-pumping-stations-rehabilitation-national-drainage-projects","projn":"EG-Irrig./Pumping -- P005149,EG-National Drainage -- P005146","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Water Supply and Systems,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040316100252"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,agricultural\n            projects,Agriculture,beneficiaries,bilateral donors,broad\n            range,canals,community\n            development,construction,corrosion,covering,crops,development\n            objectives,Drainage,Engineering,equipment,farmers,farms,feed,flexibility,Groundwater,Innovation,Institutional\n            Development,integration,Irrigation,laboratories,livestock,marketing,natural\n            resources,nongovernmental\n            organizations,Operations,pipe,pm,pollution,private\n            sector,Pumping,Pumping Equipment,pumping plant,Pumping\n            Stations,pumps,PVC,quality at\n            entry,stakeholders,supervision,sustainability,sustainable\n            use,waste,waste waters,water quality,Water Resources"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            production,agricultural\n            projects,Agriculture,beneficiaries,bilateral donors,broad\n            range,canals,community\n            development,construction,corrosion,covering,crops,development\n            objectives,Drainage,Engineering,equipment,farmers,farms,feed,flexibility,Groundwater,Innovation,Institutional\n            Development,integration,Irrigation,laboratories,livestock,marketing,natural\n            resources,nongovernmental\n            organizations,Operations,pipe,pm,pollution,private\n            sector,Pumping,Pumping Equipment,pumping plant,Pumping\n            Stations,pumps,PVC,quality at\n            entry,stakeholders,supervision,sustainability,sustainable\n            use,waste,waste waters,water quality,Water Resources"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND","repnb":"28003"},"1346411":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/05/1346411/egypt-national-drainage-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/05/1346411/egypt-national-drainage-project","new_url":"2001/05/1346411/egypt-national-drainage-project","disclosure_date":"2009-05-21T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/07/13/000094946_01062804081761/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/07/13/000094946_01062804081761/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"3417","credit_no":"2313","docdt":"2001-05-16T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2001-07-13T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Egypt - National Drainage Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is rated as satisfactory\n            and project sustainability is adjudged as likely. Overall\n            World Bank performance has been satisfactory, in that it\n            maintained realism and flexibility, as its staff kept\n            themselves focused on the project's development\n            objectives. Similarly, Borrower performance overall has been\n            satisfactory, which has resulted in the successful\n            implementation of the project. Lessons learned include the\n            following: Flexibility was the key to success in this type\n            of project--a flexible approach was used in selecting and\n            prioritizing areas for installing new sub-surface drainage\n            or for their rehabilitation. Also, the Bank and implementing\n            agency maintained flexibility in the program to reallocate\n            resources to cover urgently needed areas, which arose during\n            implementation. In the Egyptian context, the project\n            implementation timetable should give full consideration to\n            the length of time required between board approval and\n            effectiveness because Parlaiment does not often ratify\n            loan/credit agreements within a short period. Further\n            institutional building is needed to computerize the design\n            process, the operation and maintenance of the drainage\n            system, and the monitoring and evaluation of drainage\n            impacts.

This project finances a\n            six-year period of the National Drainage Program (NDP),\n            covering about 720,000 feddans (fed) and encompassing the\n            installation or replacement of subsurface drains and the\n            remodeling of existing open drains throughout the Nile\n            Valley and Delta. Vertical drains will be installed as a\n            pilot effort on 5,000 feddans. Technical assistance and\n            training will be provided to address contractor weaknesses\n            and to assist in the strengthening of EPADP. A coordinated\n            monitoring and evaluation program will be introduced.\n            Special emphasis will be given to adaptive research for\n            drain installation in unstable soils, drainage in heavy clay\n            soils, vertical drainage and the used of PVC pipe for\n            collectors.

- National Drainage Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall objectives of the project\n            are to:  (a) increase agricultural productivity by\n            evacuating excess water and salts from undrained areas,\n            reversing the current land deterioration trend; and (b)\n            improve institutional planning and the implementation\n            capacity of the drainage subsector.  This project finances a\n            six-year period of the National Drainage Program (NDP),\n            covering about 720,000 feddans (fed) and encompassing the\n            installation or replacement of subsurface drains and the\n            remodeling of existing open drains throughout the Nile\n            Valley and Delta. Vertical drains will be installed as a\n            pilot effort on 5,000 feddans. Technical assistance and\n            training will be provided to address contractor weaknesses\n            and to assist in the strengthening of EPADP. A coordinated\n            monitoring and evaluation program will be introduced.\n            Special emphasis will be given to adaptive research for\n            drain installation in unstable soils, drainage in heavy clay\n            soils, vertical drainage and the used of PVC pipe for\n            collectors. In order to reduce fiscal constraints, an\n            improved system for the recovery of investment and O&M\n            costs related to subsurface drainage will be worked out and implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - National Drainage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - National Drainage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/10/735940/egypt-national-drainage-project","projn":"EG-National Drainage -- P005146","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Water Supply and Systems,Engineering,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Agriculture,Science and Technology Development,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961001174529"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture,Science and Technology Development,Water Supply and Sanitation","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,barrages,canals,CDP,construction,covering,covers,creditworthiness,Crops,dams,ditches,Drainage,drainage\n            systems,drainage water,drainage works,Drains,efficient\n            use,Equipment,extension,farmers,farms,feed,flexibility,Groundwater,incomes,Irrigation,irrigation\n            water,land resources,land surface,livestock,livestock\n            products,marketing,momentum,operators,petroleum,Pipe,pipes,private\n            sector,Public Works,pump stations,pumping\n            stations,pumps,PVC,quality control,screening,soil\n            permeability,soils,stabilization,structures,telemetry,texture,water\n            application,Water distribution,Water Research,Water\n            Resource,Water Resources,water table,water tables"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,barrages,canals,CDP,construction,covering,covers,creditworthiness,Crops,dams,ditches,Drainage,drainage\n            systems,drainage water,drainage works,Drains,efficient\n            use,Equipment,extension,farmers,farms,feed,flexibility,Groundwater,incomes,Irrigation,irrigation\n            water,land resources,land surface,livestock,livestock\n            products,marketing,momentum,operators,petroleum,Pipe,pipes,private\n            sector,Public Works,pump stations,pumping\n            stations,pumps,PVC,quality control,screening,soil\n            permeability,soils,stabilization,structures,telemetry,texture,water\n            application,Water distribution,Water Research,Water\n            Resource,Water Resources,water table,water tables"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND","repnb":"9792"},"facets":{}}}
