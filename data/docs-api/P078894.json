Some\n            lessons learned include: project designs should include all\n            of the elements necessary to meet the development objectives\n            or otherwise estimate operational risks accordingly. Future\n            operations should contemplate the sustainability of\n            partnerships that can be strained by high turnover in the\n            leadership of a partner institution, and if finally\n            included, assess the risks associated with that\n            interdependence. Projects involving Information and\n            Communications Technology (ICT) activities should require\n            that all parties commit to robust standardized protocols\n            beforehand. The project failed to identify how a zero error\n            clause included in the contract has impeded the satisfactory\n            delivery of consulting products for an activity of such a\n            grand scale. Implementing a project with multiple executing\n            units should require additional agreements on project\n            governance structures. It is difficult to promote inter- and\n            intra-institutional communication if the coordination risks\n            have not been tackled through appropriate agreements on\n            project governance structures.

The changes aim at consolidating\n            project achievements and ensuring project sustainability\n            after closing. The modifications include: (i) changes in\n            implementation arrangements following the decision of\n            Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) to convert the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) into an autonomous budget-holder\n            unit; (ii) changes in component-specific costs; (iii)\n            changes in disbursement arrangements to introduce a new\n            disbursement category, reallocation of Loan proceeds, and an\n            increase in the disbursement percentage (up to 82 percent of\n            the expenditure categories) which is consistent with\n            Peru's country financing parameters to provide adequate\n            financing for selected activities; (iv) extension of the\n            closing date by six months to June 30, 2012 to complete\n            critical project activities and ensure satisfactory outcome\n            at exit; (v) changes to selected indicators of the results\n            framework to ensure closer alignment of the contribution of\n            project-financed activities to the achievement of the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO);

will consolidate the decentralization and\n            sustainability of a quality, real property rights system, to\n            facilitate access for the Peruvian population. This system\n            will enhance the welfare of real property owners, and\n            facilitate access to economic opportunities. It will further\n            reduce the negative impacts of informality, ensuring the\n            legal security of property rights, completing conversion of\n            informal tenure, and building capacity to address its causes\n            through strategic partnerships at various levels of\n            Government, and key stakeholders in the private sector and\n            civil society. The comprehensive real property rights\n            policies component will strengthen the policy-making process\n            on property rights, ensuring stronger legal, regulatory and\n            institutional reforms, and, also ensure that further policy\n            reforms will lead to equitable, and sustainable\n            socio-economic outcomes. It will finance technical\n            assistance (TA) in knowledge management, and in the\n            preparation of sound legal and regulatory reform proposals,\n            in inter-institutional coordination in a decentralized\n            governance framework, access to affordable land, land use\n            planning for municipalities, and the linkages between real\n            property rights institutions and the financial, and housing\n            sectors. The second component, decentralized formalization\n            and cadastre services provision, will establish the cadastre\n            services in urban and peri-urban areas among the\n            participating municipalities, through TA provided to\n            COFOPRI, in adapting the needs of informal owners;\n            justifying the cost-benefit terms; and, providing\n            capacity-building for provincial and district\n            municipalities. The modern, real property registry systems\n            component will support the integration of real property\n            data, and the establishment of the national cadastre system,\n            to improve the quality of, and access to real property\n            registry services. Communications and Information component\n            seeks to formalize benefits, by fostering real\n            property-related economic activity. Specifically, it will\n            provide information linkages between registration and access\n            to credit; reduce information gaps for credit providers;\n            identify measures to facilitate real property transactions;\n            and, develop strategic public-private partnerships to\n            promote business development. Finally, the fifth component\n            will support project management activities, namely,\n            monitoring and evaluation, project coordination, and the\n            assessment and accountability frameworks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Real Property Rights Consolidation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Real Property Rights\n            Consolidation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/02/6621841/peru-real-property-rights-consolidation-project","projn":"PE-Real Property Rights Consolidation\n            Project -- P078894","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Real Estate Development,Municipal Housing and Land,Municipal Financial Management,Land and Real Estate Development,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20060227100939"},"subsc":"General public administration sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, accounting, agents, Assets,\n            Banks, Bidding, CONSOLIDATION, Construction,\n            Decentralization, decentralization process, disclosure,\n            employment, Financial Management, fiscal policy, Housing,\n            Insurance, Key performance indicators, land use, land use\n            planning, laws, legislation, local governments,\n            macroeconomic stability, Management Reports, municipal,\n            Municipal Governments, Municipalities, private property,\n            PROPERTY RIGHTS, property titles, property transfers,\n            property values, real estate, real estate markets, REAL\n            PROPERTY, Secure property rights, Tax Administration,\n            technical assistance, transaction costs, urban land, urban\n            land tenure,"}},"owner":"Public Sector (LCSPS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"34988"},"facets":{}}}
