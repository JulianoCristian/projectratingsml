Some lessons learned\n            include the following: while it is tempting to take\n            advantage of the post-disaster window of opportunity to\n            introduce institutional and regulatory reforms to promote\n            disaster prevention and mitigation, there is a need to be\n            realistic about what can be practically achieved in the\n            context of an emergency recovery project. Establishing\n            effective institutional framework and building capacity for\n            disaster risk management institutions is a long-term agenda\n            that is not likely to be achieved within the life span of\n            one project, in a course of 4-5 years. The existence of a\n            post-disaster recovery project implementation unit, solely\n            dedicated to the reconstruction efforts does accelerate and\n            strengthen the process. Post-disaster recovery needs tend to\n            be overestimated, therefore, while designing the housing\n            reconstruction projects, the teams should be very prudent in\n            needs assessments and take into account other factors and\n            housing options affected people have in the medium- or\n            longer-term following the disaster. The successful\n            reconstruction program should pay close attention and\n            support not only to reconstruction of housing units but also\n            to adequate social infrastructure, such as schools, clinics,\n            shopping areas, as well as public spaces, etc., which\n            contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the\n            affected communities. Finally, the issues which involve\n            complex and deeply-rooted factors are unlikely to be\n            resolved within one project cycle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Marmara Earthquake Emergency\n            Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Marmara Earthquake\n            Emergency Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/8155891/turkey-marmara-earthquake-emergency-reconstruction-project","projn":"TR-Marmara Earthquake Emergency\n            Reconstruction Project -- P068368","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Natural Disasters,Disaster Management,Hazard Risk Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Conflict and Development","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020439_20070823120421"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Non-compulsory pensions and insurance,Law and justice,Housing construction,Health","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Urban Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Conflict and Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance,Industry and trade,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actual cost, ambulance, ambulances, Bank\n            Ratings, building code, building codes, capital markets,\n            catastrophic events, Catastrophic Insurance, Catastrophic\n            Insurance Pool, Civil Defense, clinics, communicable\n            diseases, contractual savings, cost effectiveness, damages,\n            decentralization, Disaster, disaster emergency, Disaster\n            Information, disaster insurance, disaster insurance scheme,\n            disaster management, Disaster Mitigation, disaster\n            preparedness, disaster prevention, disaster reconstruction,\n            disaster recovery, Disaster Response, Disaster Response\n            System, disaster risk, disaster risk reduction, disaster\n            risks, disasters, Documents, EARTHQUAKE, earthquakes,\n            effects on health, emergencies, emergency communication\n            system, emergency health, Emergency Management, emergency\n            operation, emergency operations, Emergency Preparedness,\n            Emergency Recovery, Emergency Recovery Loan, emergency\n            response, ERL, families, feasibility studies, Financial\n            Management, Flood, flood management, flood protection,\n            floods, generators, health care, health services,\n            homelessness, Housing, impact of disaster, information\n            campaigns, Information System, information systems,\n            Injuries, institutional development, Insurance, insurance\n            premiums, insurers, international organizations, key\n            performance indicators, land supply, land use, laws, legal\n            framework, legislation, living conditions, local\n            governments, Management reviews, Mental Health,\n            municipalities, national emergency, Natural disaster,\n            natural disasters, natural hazard, natural hazards,\n            pensions, recovery operations, regulatory framework,\n            reinsurance, relief, relief effort, Rescue, Rescue Teams,\n            risk analyses, risk assessment, risk management, risk\n            reduction, savings, search and rescue, search and rescue\n            teams, sewage, Technical Assistance, tent, urban\n            development, urban housing, Vulnerability Studies, working\n            capital, working conditions"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022839-GERMAN JPO-MR.

It also creates an\n            insurance mechanism, establishing and expanding national\n            catastrophic risk management and risk transfer capabilities\n            by making liquidity readily available to resident owners of\n            damaged or destroyed dwellings; reducing government fiscal\n            exposure; ensuring the financial solvency of the pool; and\n            reducing government dependency on the Bank and other donors.\n            This first component also reviews legal reforms, and\n            strengthens the municipal capability to regulate, plan, and\n            implement disaster resistant development. Lastly, this\n            component establishes a land information system while\n            updating and improving obsolete registers and maps. The\n            second component funds the development of a trauma program\n            for adults, which sets up community mental health centers\n            and programs for psychological and organizational support.\n            The third component reconstructs permanent housing in\n            earthquake-affected areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
