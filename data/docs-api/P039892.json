However, the quality of road works could have\n            been higher if international technical supervision standards\n            had been in place. Also, it would have been better if the\n            government had developed more adequate road user charges to\n            assure the necessary level of funding for road maintenance\n            beyond emergency repairs and reconstruction. Other lessons\n            learned: The risk of currency fluctuations needs to be\n            considered when calculating contingencies and determining\n            credit amounts. State control procedures need to be adapted\n            to internationally accepted and recognized methods,\n            including official acceptance of the reports of the\n            international auditors provided under the Development Credit\n            Agreement. Initially, there were response delays and\n            misunderstandings on procurement matters because of\n            inexperience and lack of project ownership in the Georgian\n            transport sector; however, project ownership increased\n            during implementation. There were difficulties in editing\n            Georgian translations of reports prepared by foreign\n            consultants in English and translated by local interpreters.\n            The latter need to have some background in analytical skills\n            to understand the subject and good knowledge of Georgian\n            technical language. Georgian translations of concepts and\n            terms used by the Bank in legal documents and procedures\n            need unifying. Other fields needing to exchange information\n            and to increase cooperation are procurement, accounting, and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Transport Rehabilitation
