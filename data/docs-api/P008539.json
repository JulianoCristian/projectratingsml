Following are\n            lessons learned from the project: Comprehensive and\n            participatory project preparation that includes substantial\n            analytical work, initial development of policy framework and\n            basic principles of institutional and organizational\n            framework is critical to ensure high quality implementation.\n            Although the project was clear about expected outcomes, the\n            key performance indicators were not very useful to monitor\n            project performance. Flexibility to adjust the lending\n            instrument (for example, formal gradual closure of fully\n            implemented project components) that would take into account\n            the changed circumstances would benefit the project. For\n            project activities where cooperation between different\n            levels of government is essential, more efforts need to be\n            spent initially to build real partnership that is based on\n            mutual understanding about the objectives and benefits of\n            the joint program.
