Lessons\n            learned: The most serious problem and the one that created\n            the largest fiscal costs at National Mortgage Bank (BHU) was\n            the currency mismatch as most of the liabilities were in\n            dollars while the assets were in pesos. The system of\n            promitentes compradores (or quasi-buyers), individuals who\n            in fact rent properties with a promise to buy in the future,\n            was a bad system and needs to be discontinued immediately\n            for new operations. Public banks in general and BHU in\n            particular have shown to have difficulties in foreclosing\n            properties, especially in low income housing projects.\n            Governance is an important issue for the sustainability of\n            reforms, and development policy loans should evaluate this\n            issue in the preparation stage. Some of the reforms were\n            affected by the procurement procedures of BHU and by the\n            restrictions imposed by the unions. The preparation of a\n            portfolio of mortgages for securitization in the markets was\n            delayed by the difficulties in processing the information on\n            the mortgages in a way that could be accepted by a rating\n            agency. The difficulties were in part related to the design\n            of the administrative structure of BHU, where the same staff\n            had to restructure the bank, work on collecting loans and on\n            the securitization of mortgages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay -
