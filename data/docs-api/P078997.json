The key lessons learned are as\n            follows:   This project clearly demonstrated that with\n            appropriate support small and medium size farmers could turn\n            out to be more productive.  In a situation where local\n            organizations are composed of different interest groups\n            (sharecroppers, medium farmers, etc.) arrangement for\n            grievances addressing mechanisms should be built into\n            institutional design where beneficiaries can register their\n            grievances and get timely and effective remedial measures.\n            Trainings still remain vital for efficient use of water,\n            soil, crop management, alternate use of saved water etc.  It\n            is important to continuously gauge the capacity and\n            awareness of local organizations and to allow them to assume\n            a bigger role. It is important to ensure that there is\n            clarity by staff at all levels on changes made to policy and\n            guidelines.  In order to prevent free-riders who benefit\n            from but do not pay for water charges, it is important to\n            improve FOs capacity to enforce rules and institute\n            incentive mechanisms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Sindh On-farm Water Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Sindh On-farm Water\n            Management
