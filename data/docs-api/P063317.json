As seen earlier, focusing objectives is crucial\n            to increase effectiveness and sustainability of project\n            outcomes but implies ruling topics out. Balancing the two\n            requires building stakeholder understanding of the issue, so\n            as to adequately channel expectations into focused\n            agreements. Seeking to adapt a national biodiversity policy\n            framework to a six year project geographically too ambitious\n            undermines achievement of outcomes. Co-coordinated donor\n            investments and actions, in particular under a programmatic\n            approach, should be actively sought to help strengthen the\n            impact of single interventions. Results-framework and\n            M&E schemes critically affect output-outcome and\n            component linkages few and synthetic indicators focusing on\n            how outputs lead up to desired outcomes help overcome\n            segmented approaches to project implementation. As a first\n            generation GEF project seeking to promote public and private\n            conservation and sustainable use efforts in the Colombian\n            Andes, including mainstreaming biodiversity considerations\n            in sectoral practices and policies, the design of a useful\n            M&E framework proved to be a challenge that was not surmounted."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Andean Region Conservation and\n            Sustainable Use of Biodiversity Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Andean Region\n

a review of the legal\n            framework for, and a consultation process with indigenous\n            peoples. Based on lessons learned, that scientific technical\n            assistance needs to be based on the recognition, and respect\n            of autonomous indigenous decisions, particularly as it\n            concerns their traditional methods to conserve, and manage\n            biodiversity, the need to ensure adequate, and transparent\n            mechanisms for conflict resolution, is imminent. Mitigation\n            plans suggest: 1) the development of a continuous process of\n            information, training, and evaluation with the indigenous\n            groups, farmers, and conservation/scientific groups, to\n            protect territorial integrity, and initiate environmental\n            education with the agricultural communities; 2) provision of\n            training programs to communities, to raise awareness of the\n            biological value within their territories, and of associated\n            social pressures. Norms for the use of resources shall be\n            discussed, and prepared between communities, and local\n            authorities alike; 3) in coordination with indigenous\n            experts, and scientists, identify the botanical species\n            traditionally used for medicinal purposes, to ascertain\n            universal medical uses, build logistical support, and\n            process information; and, 4) development of knowledge\n            exchange programs, as well as promotion of native\n            traditional production systems, such as home gardens, to\n            build medicinal centers of traditional knowledge to assist\n            patients, and, promote marketing of medicinal plants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
