By late 2008 development partners governance\n            concerns escalated. As a result, the International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) postponed its Board presentation that was\n            scheduled for December, 2008. Donor coordination for budget\n            support remains essential. A partnership agreement was\n            signed in 2004 between the Government and the key budget\n            support donors, the European Union (EU), France (Agence\n            Francaise de Developpement and the French Co-operation), the\n            African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, later\n            joined by Germany. The goal was to provide a better\n            alignment with Government procedures and Paris declaration\n            objectives. Broader monitoring of developments on the ground\n            and more attention to outcomes, as opposed to inputs, is\n            needed. Although selected prior actions and indicators were\n            coordinated with the Government's action plan and\n            Madagascar Action Plan (MAP) objectives, their monitoring\n            did not always provide a whole picture of real progress on\n            the ground, especially in regards to developments on the\n            governance front. Even when the range of systemic\n            performance issues is broad, as it is in all areas supported\n            under the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series,\n            especially Public Finance Management (PFM), it remains\n            important to set as much as possible a few reasonable\n            objectives aiming at gradual and sustainable improvements.\n            Supplemental financing may sent mixed signals to authorities\n            when issues emerge in the implementation of a PRSC-supported program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Fourth and Fifth

fourth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) for Madagascar. This\n            operation is the first of a new series of three PRSCs to be\n            disbursed as single tranche operations. It is consistent\n            with the Bank's new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)\n            discussed at the Board of Executive Directors on April 3,\n            2007, to support the implementation of the Government's\n            poverty reduction strategy as laid out in the Madagascar\n            Action Plan (MAP). The objective of the MAP is to promote\n            rapid and sustainable development over the next five years\n            in line with the Government's national vision document\n            (Madagascar Naturally) and the UN Millennium Development\n            Goals (MDGs). To attain this objective, the MAP presents\n            eight key commitments: (i) responsible governance; (ii)\n            connected infrastructure; (iii) educational transformation;\n            (iv) rural development and a green revolution; (v) health,\n            family planning and the fight against HIV/AIDS; (vi) high\n            growth economy; (vii) cherish the environment; and (viii)\n            national solidarity. The new PRSC series will continue to\n            support the Government to implement its comprehensive\n            governance reform program. A key priority will be the\n            consolidation of the reforms initiated under the first PRSC\n            series (PRSC 1, 2 and 3), mainly to further refine the\n            regulatory and institutional governance framework which has\n            been developed since 2003, to close existing gaps, and to\n            improve impact of governance related activities. Additional\n            support will be given to governance reforms, in particular\n            governance challenges in selected entities such as the\n            revenue agencies and in sensitive sectors such as the\n            forestry and the mining sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Fourth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit
