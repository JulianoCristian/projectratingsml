The Tenth Highway\n            Project focused primarily on the lesser-developed areas of\n            the country and included five borrowers - Kosovo,\n            Montenegro, Macedonia, Vojvodina and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The\n            Eleventh Highway Project helped maintain the impetus\n            established by the previous Seventh, Eighth and Ninth\n            Highway Projects on improvements to key sections of the\n            Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH). The Tenth and Eleventh Highway\n            Projects were both implemented during a period of structural\n            adjustment which involved a substantial reduction in the\n            level of expenditures on roads. The Tenth Highway Project\n            introduced a sector-lending approach which provided some\n            flexibility in adjusting to the reduced level of funds and\n            in redefining priorities. Some of the lessons learned\n            included: 1) Despite up to a two-year delay in the\n            completion of most items, most of the road improvement\n            programs was completed as originally planned; 2) In\n            hindsight, the Bank should have coordinated the disbursement\n            of co-financing funds with its own disbursements on the\n            project; 3) As in previous projects, equipment procurement\n            was delayed because of difficulties in obtaining import\n            licenses and a substantial part of the allocation for\n            equipment under the Eleventh Project was cancelled; and 4)\n            Closer attention might have been paid to design standards at\n            appraisal and revisions might have been introduced during\n            the SAP discussion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia -
