Some\n            lessons learned included: Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) is\n            an effective financing vehicle to address changing\n            circumstances in a fragile or post conflict state. The MDTF\n            accommodated additional donor funds and was able to use\n            freed funds for other development priorities and to add\n            components to expand the reach of the project (employment\n            and small works for hundreds of thousands of additional\n            beneficiaries). Appropriate results frameworks and Project\n            Development Objectives (PDOs) that match project activities\n            are feasible and necessary even in projects in fragile,\n            post-conflict countries. There is a tendency for government\n            counterparts, when flooded with donors and donor support, to\n            become complacent and defer to the donor community, which\n            may result in missed opportunities for capacity building.\n            Political imperatives may trump best practices in ensuring\n            project success. Giving each donor their own role in the\n            MDTF may improve participation and therefore effectiveness,\n            even if it may not maximize efficiency through a single,\n            harmonized governance structure. The end result was that a\n            number of important donors peeled off from the MDTF and\n            pursued their own programs and far less resource were\n            provided to the MDTF- Southern Sudan (SS) than were\n            originally pledged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan -
