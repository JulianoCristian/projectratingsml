The basic objectives were to assist Government of\n            Indonesia (GOI) in the implementation of its framework for\n            infrastructure development by initiating immediate actions\n            to (a) assess priorities in current infrastructure plans for\n            reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; and (b) (i) augment and\n            enhance program evaluation capability (including, in\n            particular, in cross-sectoral linkages and environment\n            aspects) within National Development Planning Agency\n            (BAPPENAS), and (ii) project preparation capability in line\n            agencies responsible for key infrastructure sectors,\n            including projects financed by or jointly with the private\n            sector. Bank performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            overall performance during implementation can be assessed as\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were: (i) the project\n            has demonstrated that GOI's ability to manage Technical\n            Assistance (TA) resources efficiently; (ii) the major policy\n            studies undertaken in the power and transport sectors\n            demonstrate this capacity clearly, though this was not free\n            of pain at the time for the sector managers responsible;\n            (iii) in particular, the power sector study was an example\n            of best practice achieved and to aim for in future similar\n            efforts; and (iv) the implementation experience of TAP4I has\n            also some specific cautionary lessons for future projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
