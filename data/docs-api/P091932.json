satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the mosaic conservation\n            concept, when designed and applied with the necessary due\n            diligence, strict oversight and extensive level of local\n            participation, does produce significant conservation\n            benefits. The project served as the very first trial of this\n            idea and then further replicated it during the additional\n            financing. Local participation as well as a solid strategy\n            for continuous communication and dissemination was the key\n            to promote local buy-in and appropriation of project\n            activities. World Bank and global environment facility\n            (GEF)-supported trust funds were taken into account during\n            the project design, and indeed contributed to paving the way\n            for the successful establishment and growth of Patrimonio\n            Natural, a trust fund that ultimately transcended its\n            original project management role and became a significant\n
