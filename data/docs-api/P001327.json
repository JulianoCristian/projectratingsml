The project\n            partially achieved its objectives, institutional development\n            was partially achieved, sustainability is uncertain, and the\n            performance of the Bank was marginally satisfactory while\n            the Borrower's was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, much more up-front sector\n            work, preparation, and dialogue is needed to ensure a\n            well-defined sector reform program. Second, when a\n            turnaround in the performance of existing institutions is\n            desired, attention to institutional deficiencies should be\n            rigorous and alternatives should be explored. Third, to\n            improve the quality of education, future reforms should\n            examine alternatives to centralized determination and\n            provision of school inputs. Fourth, studies that are not\n            formal requirements for tranche releases tend to be of\n            varying quality and actions emerging from them late or\n            absent. Finally, future support for the Government's\n            reforms should include more direct support to the education sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Education Sector Adjustment
