The 3DH Vision focuses on development\n            efforts in the enjoyment of human rights. The Vision 3DH is\n            specially designed for individuals and development agents\n            who conceive, design, implement, evaluate and study\n            development projects, to be interested in expanding impacts\n            in the enjoyment of rights.
