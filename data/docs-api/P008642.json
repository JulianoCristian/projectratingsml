The project is not rated and will not\n            be audited. The loan was never signed because of internal\n            disagreements within the Ministry of Agriculture with\n            project objectives. A contributing factor was that in 1985\n            Portugal was on the verge of becoming a member of the\n            European Community (EC), which agreed to provide funding for\n            this project number under an earlier aid scheme. In late\n            1984, the Minister of Agriculture confirmed his full\n            support, but noted that the project stood a good chance of\n            being cofinanced by the EC. The EC confirmed this option and\n            the Bank also agreed to this solution. However, as no\n            decision was being made, in early June 1985 the Bank\n            informed the Government that it would withdraw the loan if\n            it was not signed. The loan was withdrawn on July 15, 1985.\n            Despite the withdrawal of the loan proposal, all preparatory\n            work done by the Bank was not lost as the Ministry of\n            Agriculture carried out many of the project components under\n            EC financing. The short experience of this project permits\n            no major lessons. However, knowing that Portugal was about\n            to join the EC, the Bank staff might have sought to\n            cooperate more closely with the Government in the\n            preparation of a cofinancing scheme."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Portugal - Agricultural Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Portugal - Agricultural Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/03/734663/portugal-agricultural-services-project","projn":"PT-Ta/Agriculture -- P008642","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Knowledge Economy,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Education for the Knowledge Economy,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Education","count":"Portugal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925211411"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural extension","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,ASP,Borrower,European Economic\n            Community,Extension,knowing,Legal documents,LOAN,Loan\n            Amount,Operations,PROJECT COMPLETION,supervision"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,ASP,Borrower,European Economic\n            Community,Extension,knowing,Legal documents,LOAN,Loan\n            Amount,Operations,PROJECT COMPLETION,supervision"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"11728"},"741869":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/05/741869/portugal-agricultural-services-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/05/741869/portugal-agricultural-services-project","new_url":"1984/05/741869/portugal-agricultural-services-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1984/05/01/000009265_3970716150449/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1984/05/01/000009265_3970716150449/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2457","datestored":"1984-05-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1984-05-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Portugal - Agricultural Services Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Agricultural Services Project's\n            objectives will be to help the Government formulate an\n            agricultural development strategy in the context of\n            Portugal's anticipated entry into the European Economic\n            Community.
