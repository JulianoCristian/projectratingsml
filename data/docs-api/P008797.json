The\n            lessons learned indicate that a detailed implementation\n            plan, developed in advance, is critical to ensuring timely\n            project execution and organization. Continuity of\n            counterpart collaboration is critical, and if there are\n            unavoidable changes, prompt and effective steps must be\n            taken to maintain ownership and understanding. When\n            purchasing equipment which requires sustained care and\n            maintenance, the funding of recurrent expenditure needs to\n            be adjusted to compensate for the additional costs of more\n            effective and higher qualitiy services. Encouraging reforms,\n            especially in the areas of public health, requires broad\n            consensus and a critical mass of stakeholder commitment if\n            reforms are to succeed. Both investment and adjustment\n            operations can be effectively used to further the overall\n            health sector reform agenda.
