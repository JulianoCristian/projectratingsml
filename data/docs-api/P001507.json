The Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. However the objectives at appraisal were\n            ambitious and very demanding for the Borrower. The frequency\n            of supervision missions exceeded the pace of the\n            project's progress. Also worth noting is the virtual\n            absence of accounting for project accounts. Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory for the port of Toamasina but\n            deficient for the Directorate of Maritime Transport (DTM)\n            ports, whose management capability was not strong enough to\n            adequately implement the project. The most important lessons\n            learned from this project suggest future efforts should seek\n            to: (a) ensure the capacity of the implementing agencies for\n            new operations as well as the availability of local funds;\n            (b) design projects that are well focused and limited in\n            their scope; (c) contract maintenance works to private\n            operators rather than by force account; (d) set up an\n            effective system for managing the information necessary for\n            supervision and implementation completion reporting; and (e)\n            set up a sound accounting system, choose an accounting\n            software, both acceptable to the Bank, and accept auditing\n            process for project accounts as a condition of\n            effectiveness. Results exceeded expectations for Mahajanga,\n            and especially for Toliara and Toamasina, where costs and\n            productivity were correctly estimated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
