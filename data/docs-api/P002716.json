The mill would use\n            locally grown cotton and imported polyester and rayon, and\n            the project output would represent about 11% of\n            Tanzania's projected total fabric production in the\n            mid-1980s. The project includes provision for financing of\n            technical assistance to TEXCO, and a training component. The\n            project faces no substantial risks with regard to technical,\n            marketing and pricing aspects. The management risk would be\n            minimized with the involvement of experienced international\n            firms during implementation and initial operations of the\n            project, and a training program has been designed to ensure\n            availability of trained manpower."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Morogoro Textile Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Morogoro Textile Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/05/726928/tanzania-morogoro-textile-project","projn":"TZ-Morogoro Textile -- P002716","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Textiles, Apparel & Leather Industry,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912380595"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other industry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            output,apparel,Auditing,balance of payments,Balance\n            Sheets,Bank loans,capital formation,capital\n            goods,clothing,Cotton,Cotton Fabrics,cotton textiles,cotton\n            yarn,Current Assets,current\n            prices,debt,dividends,Dyeing,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic\n            Development,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Elasticities,Employment,Exports,Fabrics,Financial\n            Covenants,financial data,FISCAL YEAR,Forecasts,Foreign\n            Exchange,GDP,Gross Domestic Product,growth rate,holding\n            companies,Housing,Imports,incentive systems,Income,Income\n            Statements,knitting,looms,MARKETING,Net Profit,oil,overhead\n            costs,Polyester,price controls,private sector,Production\n            Costs,productivity,Profitability,public sector,Quality\n            Control,sisal,spinning,subsidiary,Technical\n            Assistance,Textile Fibers,Textile Industries,textile\n            industry,Textile Mills,Textiles,total output,transport,value\n            added,waste,Weaving,workers,working capital,yarn"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural\n            output,apparel,Auditing,balance of payments,Balance\n            Sheets,Bank loans,capital formation,capital\n            goods,clothing,Cotton,Cotton Fabrics,cotton textiles,cotton\n            yarn,Current Assets,current\n            prices,debt,dividends,Dyeing,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,Economic\n            Development,Economic Rate of\n            Return,Elasticities,Employment,Exports,Fabrics,Financial\n            Covenants,financial data,FISCAL YEAR,Forecasts,Foreign\n            Exchange,GDP,Gross Domestic Product,growth rate,holding\n            companies,Housing,Imports,incentive systems,Income,Income\n            Statements,knitting,looms,MARKETING,Net Profit,oil,overhead\n            costs,Polyester,price controls,private sector,Production\n            Costs,productivity,Profitability,public sector,Quality\n            Control,sisal,spinning,subsidiary,Technical\n            Assistance,Textile Fibers,Textile Industries,textile\n            industry,Textile Mills,Textiles,total output,transport,value\n            added,waste,Weaving,workers,working capital,yarn"}},"owner":"WB Off:DaresSalaam-Eastern AFR 1 (AFCE1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"1893"},"facets":{}}}
