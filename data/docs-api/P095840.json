Since independence, Morocco has strongly invested\n            in building dams, developing water supply capacity to ensure\n            coverage of water needs in urban and agricultural areas.\n            Although mainly successful, this effort to develop supply\n            was not accompanied by policies of compensation to ensure\n            sustainable management, such as the management of water\n            demand, conservation and protection of water resources and\n            the development of equitable services for rural and poor\n            communities. The brief spells out that water management\n            strategies with regard to Morocco should therefore evolve to\n            meet a number of challenges: growing water deficits,\n            persistent gaps in access to services, slowness of the\n            legislative changes, programs of limited infrastructure,\n            population growth concern and climate change.

First Water Sector Policy\n            Development Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the First Water Sector\n            Policy Development Loan Project for Morocco were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the full\n            success of such a broadly scoped and substantial reform\n            program as was supported through this Development Policy\n            Loan (DPL) programmatic series requires that reform\n            ownership remains strong among all key actors and\n            sub-sectors involved, and that a strong champion be in place\n            to sustainably lead the reform program. This DPL and the\n            high quality analytical work and policy dialogue around it\n            have helped to launch a process of far-reaching changes in\n            the water sector in Morocco. Although all of the objectives\n            may not have been achieved, many gains appear to be solidly\n            established and may even carry cross-sectoral benefits. The\n            DPL preparation, in the opinion of many sector officials,\n            provided an unprecedented forum for all key stakeholders to\n            pursue a dialogue on a coordinated and comprehensive sector\n            reform agenda and to produce a broadly scoped and ambitious\n            reform program. In that sense, it seems that the DPL process\n            has created dynamism in the sector which will last beyond\n            the immediate timeframe of this DPL operation. The DPL\n            program may have underestimated the time that is required to\n            develop consensus around by-laws and decrees and their\n            adoption by the appropriate authorities. Because any change\n            to an existing governance structure is bound to be met with\n            resistance from those whose interests are at risk, continued\n            involvement of all parties and open communications should be\n            maintained at all times."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
