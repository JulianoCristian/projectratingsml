Some lessons learned includes:\n            reforms are possible even in the most difficult political\n            environment. Complex reforms are best done in stages. The\n            reforms began with the creation of a functional accounting\n            system, which in the next stage was extended beyond its\n            initial function of recording transactions to its use as a\n            control mechanism. Keep your eye on the broad objective. The\n            risk of the multi-stage approach to complex reforms is that\n            the broad objective may get lost while focusing on the\n            technical steps of the initial stages. Anchor reforms in\n            institutionalized processes. Multi-donor cooperation yields\n            a bigger reform impact.

The operation is designed to support PA\n            actions in two policy areas: (1) strengthening the fiscal\n            position. Wages and salaries are the largest expenditure in\n            the PA budget and until recently were the fastest growing\n            component of the budget. To maintain progress, the PA must\n            keep a tight lid on new hiring. PA plans to introduce a new\n            integrated human resources and payroll system, which will\n            streamline and automate personnel actions. These actions\n            combined with earlier reforms will help control the wage\n            bill and are substantial steps towards achieving the budget\n            projections of reducing the public sector wage bill to less\n            than 23 percent by 2010 and less than 19 percent in 2012;\n            and (2) improved public financial management and greater\n            transparency are necessary to not only increase\n            government's efficiency, but to attract donor support\n            for untied budget support. The program begins with\n            re-establishing basic controls and moves on to developing a\n            system of internal and external audits.  In the next year\n            the Ministry of Finance expects to include an annex to the\n            2011 budget that provides detailed financial information for\n            all major development
