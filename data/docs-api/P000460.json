        program for addressing the key macro-economic and sectoral\n            issues facing the CAR over the medium term. The objective of\n            the program is to help the Government achieve its\n            medium-term goal of a self-sustained 4 percent annual real\n            GDP growth rate. To meet this goal, several strategies have\n            been identified. They include: a) an agricultural-led growth\n            strategy; b) the retrenchment of the public sector and its\n            reorientation to activities for which it is best suited; c)\n            the mobilization of public and private resources; and d) a\n            financial strategy designed to mobilize resources. To\n            accomplish these strategies, the SAL has outlined action\n            programs for: macro-economic management; agriculture;\n            forestry; small- and medium-scale enterprises; mining;\n            public administration, and parapublic enterprises to be\n            implemented over the next sixteen months.
