Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: a) a key lesson\n            learned from the road components of the project is that\n            improvements in sector management, and additional physical\n            investments, are insufficient to improve the road\n            infrastructure in the absence of financial discipline at the\n            National Government level. The need to serve the persistent\n            accumulation of debts to contractors diverted the use of\n            resources that should have gone to infrastructure\n            maintenance; b) establishment of an autonomous road fund\n            with a well designed structure can insure a stable flow of\n            funds to road maintenance, and provide one of the\n            prerequisites for preservation of assets. However, proper\n            planning and disciplined implementation of the maintenance\n            program is equally important; and c) the railway components\n            of TRP2 and also of the previous TRP1 provide a lesson\n            similar to the one experienced in other countries during the\n            project period, namely that physical investments into a\n            railway which is still under an antiquated management\n            structure, are doomed to failure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Second Transport Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana -
