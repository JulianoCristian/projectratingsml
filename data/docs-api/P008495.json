While it is arguable that the Bank could have\n            restored project implementation, based on a satisfactory\n            quality at entry, major impediments were caused by the lack\n            of government support to the agreed restructured program.\n            The primary lesson reinforces the notion that government\n            commitment is essential for project success, irrespective of\n            changes among government officials. Further lessons suggest\n            that the introduction of a new, and private pensions system,\n            requires organizational, legal, and institutional\n            arrangements, to be completed prior to initiation. In\n            addition, a comprehensive approach would address policy\n            issues, particularly for improved health insurance systems,\n            and resolve structural deficits in revenue collection,\n            eliminate undermining \"gratuity\" payments, and\n            financial protection, and move towards acquiring medical\n            services, and supplies, strengthening private medical\n            delivery services. The politicized Social Insurance\n            management should be transformed into a new professional\n            cadre of civil servants, committed to achieve a functioning,\n            and independent organization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary -
