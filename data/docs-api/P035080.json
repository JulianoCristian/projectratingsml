Lessons learned convey the following.\n            Efforts to install performance contracts between government\n            agencies which are intended to bring about changes,\n            particularly behavioral, need to include provisions for\n            sufficiently attractive incentives, to overcome resistance\n            to change, and to generate support. As well, performance\n            contracts need to be based on realistic, and clearly,\n            defined assumptions, regarding how the expected performance\n            changes would be judged - and what would occur if these are\n            not accomplished. To this end, the staff of institutions\n            targeted for reform should be informed on the goals, and\n            methods to be developed, and used, to help ensure\n            consistency, and common understandings of future\n            responsibilities. Furthermore, plans for comprehensive\n            institutional reforms should be carefully sequenced,\n            complemented by provisions for broader approaches, when\n            capacity, and readiness indicators so reveal. The project\n            experience thus shows that, implementation of the new\n            financial management system was enhanced by the application\n            of a comprehensive, governing concept: the adoption of a\n            rule-based system, accompanied by regulatory procedures on\n            sub-systems, and supported by modern information technology.\n            It is emphasized though, that future institutional reform\n            projects be coordinated, to minimize inconsistencies, and\n            conflicting provisions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua -
