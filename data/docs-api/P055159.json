Lessons\n            learned from the project: Lack of government ownership\n            undermines the effectiveness of even the best intentioned\n            and designed operation. While risk taking during design\n            should be encouraged, the Bank should not hesitate to draw\n            back if an innovation fails. Technical Assistance is an\n            expensive vehicle for policy dialogue when lack of political\n            will rather than capacity is the key constraint on reform.\n            There is a need, however, to reconsider how to best deliver\n            technical assistance in environments such as Uzbekistan. In\n            the context of uncertain or limited Government ownership,\n            reluctance of the Borrower to restructure may reflect\n            concern over internal reprisals rather than
