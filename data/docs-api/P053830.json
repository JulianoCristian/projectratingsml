Some lessons learned includes: during rapid\n            changes to policy and institutions, providing just-in-time\n            policy advice is more helpful to counterparts than large\n            consultancy contracts, which in this case were stalled by a\n            quality and cost-based selection method. Rapid policy and\n            institutional changes rendered existing tours redundant and\n            revising them created even longer delays. Small flexible\n            contracts may be more useful and attractive to clients under\n            such conditions and Bank project teams should respond\n            rapidly to provide cutting edge advice to clients. Key\n            project development objective (PDO) indicators should be\n            linked specifically to Project activities, unaffected by\n            exogenous, confounding factors, and achievable within the\n            Project lifespan. For example, it was believed\n            'increase in forestry revenues' will result from\n            regulations drafted in the project design. However, adoption\n            and implementation of new regulations is a prolonged process\n            and both may be incomplete before project closing.\n            Furthermore, forest revenues depend largely on demand for\n            wood products and the overall state of the economy, over\n            which the project had no control. Multiple layers\n            implementing agencies should be avoided; involving multiple\n            implementing agencies created bureaucratic overlaps and\n            slowed project implementation. If several agencies must be\n            involved, responsibilities should be clearly delineated.\n            Procurement of firefighting equipment helped meet a\n            significant upgrading need in forest fighting capacity in\n            fire-prone Russia, as evidenced by the Government's\n            large additional contribution to counterpart financing to\n            replicate it in more regions than originally planned. As the\n            2010 fires showed there is room for further replication in\n            other regions. Procurement specifications for forest\n            firefighting and other equipment should not be\n            insufficiently detailed to address regional differences.\n            Easy availability of spare parts should be factored in\n            equipment selection criteria."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Sustainable Forestry\n            Pilot

The changes will be to: (1) strengthen the new\n            critical functions of the Federal Forestry Agency in the\n            areas of policy development, national forest\n            inventory/monitoring, and staff training (Part A of the\n            project); (2) provide US$l0.0 million of additional\n            Government co-financing for these new activities; (3) open a\n            second special account and consolidate implementation\n            responsibilities for Part B of the project inside\n            Roseximbank (agent bank); and (4) extend the project until\n            November 2009.

However, this environmental assessment\n            has proposed essential management principles, and practices\n            to comply with during project implementation. Russian\n            environmental, safety, and social standards, in compliance\n            with international requirements, will be applicable\n            regarding equipment handling, agrochemical inputs, new plant\n            species for re-vegetation purposes, as well as, for the\n            design, and site selection criteria to minimize adversity.\n            Appropriate contingency funds will be budgeted to conduct\n            mandatory State Ecological Expertise of on-site project\n            activities, and Bank's funds should be explicitly\n            conditioned for such activities. Mitigation measures\n            include: 1) selection of forestry pilot areas, determined on\n            an eligibility criteria, to include the company's\n            environmental track record, and capability, with commitments\n            to implement environmental, and social requirements; 2)\n            procurement of pesticides, preparation of resettlement\n            (including indigenous people plans), or, activities in\n            international waterways, should include precautionary\n            clauses, and be proposed for financing under the project,\n            prepared by the borrower, as a condition of disbursement; 3)\n            emergency fire-fighting, and pest-control activities will be\n            supported in accordance with environmental procedures, as\n            provided by Russian legislation, and Bank guidelines; 4)\n            insurance policies, and products will be developed to\n            address environmental liabilities; and, 5) carbon\n            sequestration will require Russian institutional, human, and\n            technical capabilities to ensure activities supported by\n            other
