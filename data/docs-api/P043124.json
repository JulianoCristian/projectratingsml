Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: in post-conflict settings engagement is a\n            means to an end and needs to be accompanied by a sustained\n            policy dialogue to ensure that development gains are\n            realized in the medium term. In the area of HIV/AIDS a\n            demand-driven model of community sub-projects is more\n            appropriate for service delivery interventions that are\n            responsive to local community needs (such as home-based\n            care, support to orphans and vulnerable children) than for\n            preventive interventions targeting stigmatized risk groups\n            or stigmatized behavior. Community activities that are\n            strategically planned and coordinated with the local health\n            authorities can provide an important complement to health\n            facility-based disease control efforts. Disease control\n            projects can be complementary to and need not undermine\n            cross-cutting health system functions. Multi-sector\n            projects, such as HIV/AIDS projects, achieve better results\n            if the sectors involved are strategically chosen according\n            to their comparative

Lessons are\n            addressed as follows. During project preparation, it is\n            suggested to avoid ambitious development objectives, and\n            inappropriate key performance indicators, particularly, in\n            post-conflict, and ongoing border dispute situations, rather\n            a realistic and modest approach should be followed, through\n            a Project design, built on solid economic and sector work\n            (ESW). This project suffered from a lack of analytical work\n            in the country. Thus, some health sector analyses,\n            particularly on the status of the country's primary and\n            secondary health care, would have helped the project\n            preparation significantly. During project implementation,\n            Project activities succeeded due to key factors, namely, a\n            government highly committed to the project, strong\n            leadership in the Ministry of Health (MOH), a capable and\n            motivated implementing agency, and, the Bank's\n            commitment to country ownership and willingness to help\n            during supervision. However, it was a missed opportunity\n            that during the Project's Mid-Term Review (MTR), the\n            project design problems were not corrected. Lessons\n            regarding Hospital construction indicate that once tender\n            documents for civil works have been finalized, and contracts\n            agreed, changes should only be made if absolutely necessary,\n            by duly and carefully scrutinizing tender documents."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea -
