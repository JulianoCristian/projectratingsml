Regrettably, both performances by the\n            Bank, and Borrower are rated unsatisfactory, given\n            insufficient precautions to ensure implementation readiness,\n            and, granting credit effectiveness before the\n            Borrower's meeting the agreed conditionality, i.e., the\n            creation of a consortium of private oil companies. Key\n            lessons focus on: 1) project preparation and appraisal,\n            suggesting that leaving a critical part of the petroleum\n            supply chain, the Indeni Refinery, outside the scope of the\n            project, contributed to delays in the technical evaluation\n            of the pipeline, and to Tazama's financial problems.\n            Furthermore, if implementation progress depends on key\n            actions of private sector companies that are not parties to\n            the project, it is paramount that these actions take place\n            prior to Board Approval, emphasizing the fact that inclusion\n            of private oil marketing companies as project beneficiaries,\n            improves both implementation, and development objectives.\n            Also, a comprehensive risk assessment should be contingent\n            to a petroleum sector project requiring major institutional\n            changes; and, 2) project supervision, highlighting the\n            importance of minimizing effectiveness issues, which could\n            have avoided delays of the investment components, and, the\n            need to incorporate the Borrower's views into the\n            reporting system, to enhance ownership, and, include as\n            well, a solid policy dialogue, as part of the Bank's\n            overall macroeconomic framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia -
