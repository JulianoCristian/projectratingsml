Some lessons learned included: an\n            on-going program of lending and Analytical and Advisory\n            Activities (AAA) facilitates the delivery of timely and well\n            design budget support operations. However, in a crisis\n            situation a country may need support in areas where the Bank\n            has not been actively involved. In these situations, the\n            Bank should be guided by the relevance of the areas of\n            intervention and not by the on-going program. Still, the\n            design should mitigate the design risks through cooperation\n            with other agencies and preparation of timely diagnostics.\n            Under this DPL, the Bank team's focus on the financial\n            sector was adequate even if the Bank had not been actively\n            involved in the sector. A one tranche DPL operation avoids\n            committing an incoming administration with development\n            commitments. Still, the process of transition between two\n            administrations may delay delivery of expected development\n            results under the DPL, because it may take time to align new\n            and preceding strategies and because of the lack of\n            commitment to a programmatic agenda going forward. The\n            experience under this DPL is that those risks are high even\n            when the project teams make the best efforts to minimize\n            them. Hence, the importance of designing study results\n            frameworks by minimizing dependence on the actions of the\n            incoming administration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Protecting

describes a Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL) for Protecting the Poor Under Global\n            Uncertainty in Panama. The operation supports the poverty\n            reduction efforts of the Government of Panama in the context\n            of the current global financial crisis and economic\n            slowdown. Specifically, it supports policy measures, which:\n            (a) mitigate the impact of economic shocks on the poor\n            through improved targeting and coverage of social sector\n            programs, and (b) help reduce the risk of an economic and\n            financial crisis through enhanced banking sector risk\n            management and strengthened banking regulation and\n            supervision. Maintenance of financial sector stability is a\n            necessary condition to poverty reduction efforts as it is\n            fundamental to sustained growth. Moreover, the costs of\n            financial and economic instability tend to be borne\n            disproportionately by the poor. The Protecting the Poor\n            under Global Uncertainty DPL also assists Panama by\n            providing access to long-term financing to support priority\n            spending during the
