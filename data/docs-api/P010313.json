Both\n            performances by the Bank, and Borrower are rated\n            unsatisfactory, given that not enough attention was paid by\n            the Bank, to the manner in which the Government was\n            implementing its 1994 Private Power Policy. Several lessons\n            are drawn from the project, among which it is suggested that\n            once independent power producers (IPPs) start operations in\n            a power system, it would be advantageous that an integrated\n            utility sector be unbundled, in order to introduce\n            competition; additionally, an automatic indexation formulae\n            should be set, to protect the utility's purchasing\n            power from fuel costs, currency devaluation, and the cost of\n            purchased power. The support to privatized power\n            infrastructure boards, and organizations, may have had the\n            unintended effect of enabling vested interest in the sector\n            to \"capture and stall\" structural changes\n            envisaged in the 1992 Strategic Plan for privatization,\n            i.e., the single buyer model had risks in terms of\n            preserving the role of the sector ministry in investment\n            decisions, shielding financiers from market risks, and\n            government interference in electricity wholesale trading.\n            Thus institutional, and regulatory frameworks are being\n            finalized, designed to protect a competitive wholesale\n            market. IPP programs need to be tailored according to public\n            financial support, and guarantees to facilitate efficient\n            investments; limit the size of the first IPP to enable ready\n            substitutions; and, have an efficient fuel supply policy,\n            with managerial, contracting capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Private Sector Energy Development

guarantee for a private sector project\n            and is a major step forward in the Bank's effort to\n            increase private sector investment in infrastructure. In\n            addition, the project sets several milestones for the Bank:\n            first use of a partial risk guarantee; largest private\n            sector infrastructure project supported by the Bank to date;\n            first Bank-financed infrastructure fund to support private\n            sector projects; and first co-guarantee with another\n            financial institution, the Japan Export-Import Bank. The\n            Bank's guarantee, which protects commercial lenders\n            against sovereign risks associated with the project,\n            establishes a new method of supporting build, own, operate\n            (BOO) projects which are normally financed on a project\n            finance or limited-recourse basis. Prior to Hub, Bank\n            guarantees were utilized as co-financing instruments\n            designed to help mobilize commercial funding for\n            Bank-supported public sector projects. It is expected that\n            the Bank guarantee for the Hub project will serve as a model\n            for future guarantees in support of other BOO projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank guarantee sparks private power\n            investment in Pakistan -
