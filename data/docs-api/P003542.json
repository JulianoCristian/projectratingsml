The project's main\n            short-term objectives were to help the port of Shanghai\n            increase its cargo handling capacity and efficiency.

Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Ningbo component of the Ningbo and\n            Shanghai Ports Project in China. The main objectives of the\n            project were to make Ningbo port's handling of\n            containers and general cargo more efficient by constructing\n            special berths with modern equipment. The project also\n            promoted efficiency by rehabilitating existing facilities\n            and training both operational and managerial staff. Finally,\n            it optimized future development by studying the potential of\n            the port to distribute cargo more economically. Project\n            implementation was highly satisfactory because all\n            objectives were achieved: Physical components were\n            constructed ahead of schedule, equipment was procured, and\n            the action plan, training and a study were carried out. The\n            findings and lessons include the following: (a) Ningbo Port\n            Authority (NPA) capably carried out the construction,\n            procured equipment, conducted studies and developed its\n            organization; (b) With regard to the procurement of\n            equipment, there is a risk that problems will surface when\n            the lowest bidders with marginal experience are awarded\n            contracts; (c) Projects should be designed as independently\n            as possible; (d) Performance indicators with regard to port\n            operations, maintenance and environmental quality were\n            clearly stated in the SAR (to monitor the project's\n            progress) and proved quite useful; (e) Project design was\n            relatively straightforward and thus avoided problems of\n            coordination among various agencies; and (f) When tariffs\n            are regulated and price increases are high, actual tariffs\n            cannot reflect actual costs. It is suggested that some\n            mechanism should be added into the tariff calculation to\n            reflect actual operational costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Ningbo and Shanghai Ports Project :\n            Ningbo Port"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
