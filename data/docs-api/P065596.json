Lessons emphasize the\n            following. Most of the project success stands on the strong\n            government commitment, and ownership, demonstrated by the\n            support sought by the government in framing a strategy for\n            managing economic shocks, and the introduction of\n            legislative changes to support the capital markets\n            component. Furthermore, the proactive analysis work\n            conducted by the Bank at the early stages, on the impact of\n            global financial shocks on emerging markets, proved not only\n            relevant for the Peruvian experience (since it was\n            motivated, based on the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis), but\n            helped focus on the highest impact issues, and speed up loan\n            preparation. As such, concerns about banking system\n            vulnerabilities, emphasized implementation of preventive\n            supervision, and bank resolution by the Superintendency of\n            Banking and Insurance: rather than limiting conditionality\n            to the preparation of new legislation, the project also\n            enhanced actual bank resolution practices. Nonetheless, it\n            would be desirable that new, or follow-up operations be\n            interlinked with previous reform programs, to ensure reform\n            benefits, i.e., more sector related work could have been\n            provided for the private pension system, which was at its\n            early stages, having been initiated under a previous\n            operation. In light of unclear options in the development of\n            capital markets, it was wise to focus on studies, and action\n            plans, to then prepare follow-up projects to implement such plans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Second Financial Sector Adjustment\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Second Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan
