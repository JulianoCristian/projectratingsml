Lessons convey that under\n            significant country risks, mitigation of those risks should\n            be strongly considered, particularly if the project entails\n            difficult technical preparation, as in this case. However,\n            the Bank made a commitment to assist Bulgaria in meeting its\n            Montreal Protocol requirements, and therefore, both the\n            Government, and the Bank made a conscious decision to delay\n            implementation of certain sub-projects, before risking\n            inefficient uses of the Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n            funds. This prudential measure, now allows private companies\n            to make use of those funds, and seize the opportunity of the\n            technology conversion, towards more competitive business.\n            Likewise, the innovative use of a non-governmental\n            organization in the public awareness program, proved\n            successful, since early feedback from the population, and\n            stakeholders could be shared; hence, if implemented early\n            on, inclusion in project design should be considered for\n            future projects. However, the resource intensive requirement\n            of multiple subprojects should be avoided, to rather manage,\n            and supervise the project effectively, and further\n            strengthen institutional capacity. The use of contract\n            penalty clauses, should be encouraged, particularly as\n            incentives for timely delivery of supplies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Ozone Depleting Substances\n            Phaseout Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria -
