PDCP, whose performance up to date has\n            been very satisfactory both from the developmental and\n            institutional stand points, is an especially suitable\n            vehicle for financing such development. The loan will be\n            used for financing a fairly large number of economically\n            sound and financially viable small, medium and\n            medium-to-large scale projects, mostly in manufacturing\n            industry. A special feature of the proposed loan is to use\n            it as a catalyst for the mobilization of complementary\n            external medium term funds from private financial\n            institutions. More specifically, PDCP has made arrangements\n            to secure a loan of $10 million from private commercial\n            sources simultaneously and in conjunction with the proposed\n            Bank loan. The terms and conditions of the private\n            commercial loan have already been agreed between the lender\n            and PDCP."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Fifth Development Corporation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Fifth Development\n            Corporation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1977/12/828263/philippines-fifth-development-corporation-project","projn":"PH-Pdcp V (Dfc) -- P004458","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912305245"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,administrative\n            procedures,agriculture,assets,balance of payments,Balance\n            Sheets,banking sector,banking system,Basic\n            metals,bonds,branch banking,capital base,Capital\n            expenditures,capital goods,Cash Flow Statements,Central\n            Bank,coal,Commercial\n            banks,consolidation,Debt,decentralization,deposits,Development\n            Strategy,Economic Development,Economic Impact,Economic Rate\n            of Return,electricity generation,employment,Equity\n            Investments,exchange rate,export processing\n            zones,exports,face value,Financial Institutions,Financial\n            Intermediaries,Financial Ratios,financial\n            resources,FINANCIAL SECTOR,fixed assets,foreign\n            banks,Foreign Currency,foreign exchange,free\n            trade,GDP,Government securities,gross value,growth\n            rate,housing,imports,Income\n            Statements,industrialization,Interest income,Interest\n            Rates,Intermediate Goods,internal cash generation,labor\n            force,low interest rates,market prices,metals,natural\n            resource base,Net profit,new entrants,Offshore\n            Banking,policy makers,Portfolio,Producers,regional\n            development banks,reserve requirements,Resource\n            Mobilization,rural banks,savings,Savings\n            banks,securities,Shareholders equity,Small\n            Business,Statistical data,stock\n            exchanges,stockholders,taxation,technical assistance,term\n            finance,terms of trade,thrift institutions,time\n            deposits,traders,transport,unemployment,value added,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,administrative\n            procedures,agriculture,assets,balance of payments,Balance\n            Sheets,banking sector,banking system,Basic\n            metals,bonds,branch banking,capital base,Capital\n            expenditures,capital goods,Cash Flow Statements,Central\n            Bank,coal,Commercial\n            banks,consolidation,Debt,decentralization,deposits,Development\n            Strategy,Economic Development,Economic Impact,Economic Rate\n            of Return,electricity generation,employment,Equity\n            Investments,exchange rate,export processing\n            zones,exports,face value,Financial Institutions,Financial\n            Intermediaries,Financial Ratios,financial\n            resources,FINANCIAL SECTOR,fixed assets,foreign\n            banks,Foreign Currency,foreign exchange,free\n            trade,GDP,Government securities,gross value,growth\n            rate,housing,imports,Income\n            Statements,industrialization,Interest income,Interest\n            Rates,Intermediate Goods,internal cash generation,labor\n            force,low interest rates,market prices,metals,natural\n            resource base,Net profit,new entrants,Offshore\n            Banking,policy makers,Portfolio,Producers,regional\n            development banks,reserve requirements,Resource\n            Mobilization,rural banks,savings,Savings\n            banks,securities,Shareholders equity,Small\n            Business,Statistical data,stock\n            exchanges,stockholders,taxation,technical assistance,term\n            finance,terms of trade,thrift institutions,time\n            deposits,traders,transport,unemployment,value added,working capital"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"1784"},"facets":{}}}
