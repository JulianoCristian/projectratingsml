The overall performance\n            of both the World Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. Among the lessons learned from this project\n            are the following: 1) Ensure leveraging and mutual support\n            between investment and adjustment lending. The use of both\n            vehicles to maintain trade reform momentum has shown to be\n            effective in the ITIP and the Fiscal Consolidation and\n            Competitive Growth Adjustment Loan. The backsliding in the\n            original reforms achieved under the former operation, which\n            substantially reduced technical barriers to trade, was\n            stemmed and reversed by the latter. 2) Ensure early private\n            sector participation in project design. Very active\n            involvement of private sector stakeholders in the design of\n            regulatory reforms and new institutional arrangements is\n            essential and can provide strong continuity to maintain\n            Project objectives and implementation momentum in the midst\n            of high turnover at government levels. 3) Provide for\n            explicit program outreach to regions and excluded groups. 4)\n            Enforce regulatory reforms with stronger institutional\n            support. 5) Ensure regulatory reforms benefit smaller firms.\n            6) Leverage broadly the successes of learning and innovation\n            programs. 7) Evaluate learning and innovation programs\n            earlier and later. Early monitoring and evaluation of\n            subprojects was found under the Project to be a sound tool\n            for program management and policy adjustments to ensure\n            proper targeting. Economic evaluation work should also be\n            scheduled for 1-2 years following the completion of\n            disbursements to better determine the full impact. 8)\n            Evaluate the fiscal impact of learning and innovation\n            programs. 9) Adjust policies to improve the impact of\n            learning and innovation programs on microbusiness.  10) Use\n            \"competitiveness\" as a process tool for policy\n            reform. The competitiveness diagnostics carried out under\n            the Program were one important impetus for structuring\n            senior government attention to this subject and increasing\n            public-private collaboration around this thematic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -
