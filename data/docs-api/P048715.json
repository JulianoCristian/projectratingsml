This is especially\n            important for new agencies implementing the Bank's\n            project for the first time; 4) from the Science and\n            Technology Network of the Agency for the Assessment and\n            Application of Technology (IPTEKnet)'s recent efforts\n            to expand into the provinces, it became ever clearer that\n            the Government of Indonesia (GOI) needs connectivity\n            throughout the country, not just Jakarta. ; 5) continuity in\n            the Bank's project team and the Coordinating Project\n            Management Implementation Unit (CPMIU) can be critical for\n            satisfactory project implementation; 6) pilot projects\n            should have a clear methodology in place for scaling up and\n            assessing viability for replication, and be backed by\n            effective implementation and enforcement of policies and\n            laws; 7) increasingly, the convergence of ICT services and\n            markets necessitates a corresponding convergence of\n            institutional authority to deal with the sector and to make\n            most effective use of limited supply of high-caliber\n            regulatory professionals; and 8) a systematic set of\n            indicators should be agreed upon and established to monitor\n            and evaluate both implementation of e-development projects\n            and their impact on sector development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Information Infrastructure and\n            Applications Development Project (IIADP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Information\n            Infrastructure and Applications Development Project (IIADP)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/7317390/indonesia-information-infrastructure-applications-development-project-iiadp","projn":"ID-Information Infrastructure Development\n            Project -- P048715","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"E-Government,E-Government,Technology Industry,ICT Policy and Strategies,Knowledge Economy","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies,Industry,Governance","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000310607_20070111153612"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Telecommunications,Other industry,Micro- and SME finance","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies,Industry,Governance","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications,Industry and trade,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agents, application software, applications\n            of e-government, automation, business development, business\n            plans, capital cities, collaboration, communication\n            services, communities, comparator countries, competition\n            policy, competitive environment, Components, computers,\n            connectivity, content development, copyright, copyright\n            protection, Data Management, digital, digital format,\n            digital TV, domain name registration, draft laws, draft\n            legislation, e-Business, e-commerce, e-democracy,\n            e-Government, e-government applications, e-Government\n            opportunities, e-government services, e-payment,\n            e-Procurement, e-Procurement system, Effective\n            implementation, electronic commerce, Electronic Information,\n            electronic networks, electronic signatures, electronic\n            transactions, equipment, Exchange Rate, foreign investment,\n            G2C, G2G, government agencies, government data, government\n            information, government ministry, government regulations,\n            Government to Business, Government to Citizen, Government to\n            Government, government workers, hardware, human resource,\n            human resources, Human Rights, ICT, informatics, information\n            exchange, INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE, information services,\n            Information Systems, information technologies, Information\n            Technology, Instruction, integrated circuits, Intellectual\n            Property, Internet connectivity, Internet Service Provider,\n            Internet Service Providers, Internet services, Intranet,\n            ISP, IT services, kiosks, leadership role, legacy systems,\n            Legal Framework, local government, local governments,\n            membership fees, multimedia, navigation, networks, new\n            information technologies, new technology, Pacific Region,\n            Patents, PC penetration, Personal Computers, phones, policy\n            issue, policy making, portals, postal industry, postal\n            sector, postal services, private sector, private sector\n            participation, programmers, programs, Property Rights,\n            public private partnerships, public sector, regulatory\n            framework, regulatory reform, security systems, software\n            development, Systems Development, technology innovation,\n            technology sector, telecommunication, telecommunication\n            projects, Telecommunications, telecommunications services,\n            telephony, Trade Secrets, user interface, website"}},"owner":"Information & Communication Tech (TWICT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF034264-INDONESIA - TOURIST INFORMATION\n            SYSTEM COMPONENT,TF034698-INDONESIA - INFORM.INFRAST.\n            & APPLI.
