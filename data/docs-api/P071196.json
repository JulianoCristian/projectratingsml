This is so,\n            mainly because without additional measures undertaken to\n            strengthen the operations of the Kenya Power and Lighting\n            Company (KPLC), possibly through privatization/contract\n            management, the sustainability of the power sector\n            operations will be uncertain. Similarly, while the\n            Government's commitment to implement the project was\n            strong, it was however, weak in executing the institutional,\n            and policy actions required. Lessons question the provision\n            of emergency recovery support, where policy and\n            institutional factors have played a role in bringing about a\n            crisis situation, and if so, whether such support should be\n            accompanied by reform conditions. The experience with this\n            operation supports the notion that the decision should be\n            based on the implications of the \"with\" and\n            \"without\" emergency support scenarios on growth,\n            and poverty. But since the design of emergency operations\n            require implementation of mitigation measures, the\n            policy/institutional related causes of the emergency would\n            need to be addressed to avoid repeat disasters. Thus, by\n            linking measures to implement reforms, stakeholders would be\n            sensitized on important sector policy issues, and, the\n            Borrower should be required to commit irreversible actions\n            to be taken prior to financing approval."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -

The project will finance the\n            Government's purchases of electricity, and associated\n            fuel from short-term independent power producers, and fuel\n            suppliers while the power supply crisis lasts. The project\n            will also finance working capital requirements, for fuel\n            purchases arising from the drought-induced changes in the\n            power generation mix, between hydro, and technical sources,\n            and from reduced revenues caused by local shedding. The\n            project will be beneficial in preventing severe economic\n            contraction, and in providing fast-track reforms in power\n            transmission, and distribution systems, to create a more\n            competitive, and private sector-led system, as agreed under\n            the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Nonetheless,\n            risks include the potential of unrealized net revenues from\n            the domestic share of project financing, which is to be\n            derived from the collection from final consumers; possible\n            coordination problems between the power company, and\n            independent power producers, which may delay timely power\n            connections; and, possible misappropriation of funds.\n            However, well established management practices may well\n            reduce those risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Emergency Power Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Emergency Power Supply Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/09/693049/kenya-emergency-power-supply-project","projn":"KE-Emergency Energy Credit -- P071196","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Environmental Economics & Policies,Climate Change and Environment,Economic Theory & Research,Power & Energy Conversion","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00101306250223"},"subsc":"Power,Oil and gas","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Capacity Building,competitive\n            power,consumers,costs of power,diesel power,DROUGHT,economic\n            conditions,economic growth,economic situation,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,employment,Energy Balance,energy\n            prices,Energy Sector,flooding,Fuels,GDP,Geothermal\n            Power,government subsidies,grid,Gross Domestic\n            Product,growth\n            rate,Imports,insurance,kerosene,legislation,liquidity,livestock\n            products,marginal cost,Negotiations,Power,Power\n            Development,power generation,power plant,power plants,Power\n            Production,POWER SECTOR,power stations,power supplies,Power\n            Supply,Power System,power systems,Power\n            transmission,precipitation,Producers,production costs,profit\n            margins,programs,pumping,rainfall,resources management,rural\n            electrification,thermal power plants,value added"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Capacity Building,competitive\n            power,consumers,costs of power,diesel power,DROUGHT,economic\n            conditions,economic growth,economic situation,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,employment,Energy Balance,energy\n            prices,Energy Sector,flooding,Fuels,GDP,Geothermal\n            Power,government subsidies,grid,Gross Domestic\n            Product,growth\n            rate,Imports,insurance,kerosene,legislation,liquidity,livestock\n            products,marginal cost,Negotiations,Power,Power\n            Development,power generation,power plant,power plants,Power\n            Production,POWER SECTOR,power stations,power supplies,Power\n            Supply,Power System,power systems,Power\n            transmission,precipitation,Producers,production costs,profit\n            margins,programs,pumping,rainfall,resources management,rural\n            electrification,thermal power plants,value added"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"T7388"},"facets":{}}}
