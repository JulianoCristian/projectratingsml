Some lessons learned included: sustained\n            commitment of senior management/officials to long-term\n            project goals and to providing strong support for the\n            operation is essential to maintain momentum. Sustained\n            consistency of messages should be maintained at all times.\n            Agreements made should be honored in order to avoid\n            confusion and unnecessary wasting of time and resources.\n            This includes adherence to mutually agreed deadlines and\n            plans. Bridge financing should be built in to avoid\n            disruptions in staffing (between Board approval and\n            effectiveness) particularly in countries with known long\n            delays in effectiveness. Agreements on major project\n            issues/activities must be detailed and documented with\n            precision so as to avoid any mis-interpretation later on.\n            When there are several distinct implementing agencies with\n            clearly different degrees of commitment and readiness at\n            appraisal, it is prudent that fiduciary functions and the\n            designated accounts for these agencies are not placed in\n            either one of the agencies. Otherwise, implementation in one\n            agency is totally dependent on the other."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Control

population? What, in general, a new strategy and social\n            protection mechanisms should be in Ukraine? These questions\n            have been for quite some time in the focus of great\n            attention of the World Bank experts. The World Bank fist\n            project in this area - the social protection support project\n            (April 1997 - June 2000) had a rather modest budget of\n            United States (U.S.) 3 million dollars, but it had a\n            considerable social effect. This will improve the\n            administering of the program of the public housing and\n            utilities subsidies (PHUSP), which was in force at that time\n            in Ukraine and caused many complaints due to cumbersome\n            (non-automated) system of processing applications, lack of\n            experience among the staff, absence of operational\n            communication between relevant local and regional agencies\n            and the ministry of labor and social policy of Ukraine. The\n            next project - the social investment fund project - approved\n            by the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank on\n            December 4, 2001, is, perhaps, one of the most successful\n            projects today. It is expected that during the six years of\n            this joint Ukraine-World Bank activities, over 500 micro\n            projects can be implemented aimed at supporting the\n            residents of poor or depressed areas, citizens with specific\n            problems, children from unhappy families, and the like. And\n            at the national level, it is necessary to refine the\n            principles of providing such poverty-targeted assistance and\n            self-aid by involving the public at large in these\n            activities. In December 2002, the Board of Executive\n            Directors of the World Bank approved yet another important\n            project - tuberculosis (TB) and acquired immunodeficiency\n            syndrome (AIDS) epidemic control project for Ukraine."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Social sphere : concentrating efforts on hot spots"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Social sphere : concentrating\n            efforts on hot spots"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955027/social-sphere-concentrating-efforts-hot-spots","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Arrears, Bank activities, Bank loan,\n            communities, community activities, complaints, Economic\n            recession, financial resources, financial support, grace\n            period, inflation, information technologies, initiative,\n            Insurance, Investment Fund, leverage, living standard, loan,\n            localities, Pension, Pension Reform, Public Housing, public\n            information, social funds, Social Insurance System, Social\n            Investment, social protection, towns, villages, wages"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social protection and risk management,Public sector governance,Social dev/gender/inclusion","topic":"Housing Subsidies m1326678 871,Housing Policy and Institutions m1327649 1722,Social Assistance m1327201 1466,Housing Finance m1327222 612,Investment Funds m1326718 341","projn":"UA-Social Protection Support Project -- P045940,UA-Country Assistance Strategy Update -- P074942,UA-Tuberculosis And Hiv/Aids Control Project\n            -- P069857,UA-Social Investment Fund Project -- P069858","subtopic":"Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Emerging Markets","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204142934"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"(Historic)Non-sector specific,Roads and highways,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General education sector,Other social services,Law and justice,Health,Central government administration","theme":"HIV/AIDS,Health system performance,Tuberculosis,Other human development,Other social protection and risk management,Participation and civic engagement,Administrative and civil service reform,Income Support for Old Age, Disability & Survivorship,Social Protection and Labor Policy & Systems","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"Country Assistance Strategy,IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Housing Subsidies m1326678 871,Housing Policy and Institutions m1327649 1722,Social Assistance m1327201 1466,Housing Finance m1327222 612,Investment Funds m1326718 341","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","F"],"trustfund":"TF022727-PEOPLE'S VOICE PROGRAM IN UKRAINE,TFM22727-PEOPLE'S VOICE PROGRAM IN UKRAINE,TFS22727-PEOPLE'S VOICE PROGRAM IN UKRAINE,BBGPG-GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS FUND,TF026294-PHRD-TUBERCULOSIS/AIDS CONTROL PROJECT,TF026452-PHRD-UKRAINE: SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF028380-UKRAINE SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT,TF028381-UKRAINE SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT,TF028940-UKRAINE SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT,TF039480-UKRAINE -

There are three project components. The first\n            component focuses on controlling tuberculosis with training\n            and education, diagnosis, treatment, public awareness\n            campaigning, and monitoring and evaluation. The second\n            component provides finance to stabilize the epidemiological\n            situation in the country, reduce risky behavior among young\n            people, and reduce the social tension in the society and\n            negative consequences of the epidemic. Specifically, this\n            component finances a pilot project to help Ukraine develop\n            capabilities to treat a limited number of adults and\n            children infected with HIV, with anti-retroviral drugs. The\n            successful implementation of this pilot will help Ukraine\n            access added funds from the Global Alliance. The third\n            component comprises the financing of TB and AIDS control\n            activities in the prison system. It was designed as a\n            separate component because of the institutional nature of\n            the prison system, a self-contained and centrally managed system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine
