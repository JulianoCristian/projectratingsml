The law and order problems in\n            Karachi throughout the project period troubled all the\n            parties involved (implementing agencies, contractors and\n            consultants, and IDA's supervision missions), delaying\n            many project activities and making site visits impossible.\n            The political instability in Sindh, resulting in four\n            government changes during the project period, was also the\n            key factor for the deficient implementation, especially of\n            the policy reform components. Three main factors which the\n            government could have controlled-its commitment, appointment\n            delays and frequent staff changes in key agencies; and\n            timely release and availability of counterpart\n            funds--adversely affected project implementation. The\n            implementing agency adversely affected project\n            implementation with poor work planning, poor contract\n            management, poor pre-qualification of contractors and\n            shortlisting of consultants, delays in seeking required\n            clearances, and poor project financial management. Hence\n            project sustainability is unlikely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated unsatisfactory. The Bank\n            failed to secure the government's commitment, assess\n            the serious risk of political change, target civil society\n            to establish consensus, restructure the project in time,\n            shorten project length, and strengthen financial management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Sindh Special Development

Sindh's (GOS's) Policy Reform\n            Program for the sector by:  (a) financing an immediate\n            action program to begin to deal with some of the most urgent\n            environmental and infrastructure problems in Karachi and\n            three interior cities; (b) supporting GOS's newly\n            created policy-making machinery in implementation of its\n            program of fiscal and administrative reforms; (c) initiating\n            institutional strengthening for two key urban services\n            organizations in Karachi; and (d) preparing engineering\n            studies for future infrastructure and transport improvements\n            in Karachi and three interior cities.  The physical\n            investment components are environmental upgrading and\n            transport improvements.
