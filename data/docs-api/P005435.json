Lessons\n            highlight the following. The project illustrates well that\n            institutional, and financial improvements are far more\n            difficult to achieve than civil works; thus, project design\n            should carefully consider the risks of financing, e.g.,\n            hardware and software as in this case, to avoid regretting\n            high financial costs, and rather choose to abandon\n            financially risky components. Particularly in middle-income\n            countries, Bank funding is expensive and not competitive,\n            where lower financing costs were found by the Government.\n            Therefore, the Bank must carefully evaluate the proxies put\n            forward to represent government commitment, because multiple\n            performance contracts were relied upon by the Bank to\n            achieve key policy objectives. However, the contracts were\n            not respected, and the Bank had little recourse during\n            implementation - short of suspension, which was not the\n            option, considering the progress being made in social\n            connections. Moreover, in light of too many implementing\n            agencies, ministries, and components, coordination efforts\n            were dissipated, which reinforces the need for an\n            established open competitive bidding to prod private sector\n            participation, rather than direct negotiation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Fifth Water Supply
