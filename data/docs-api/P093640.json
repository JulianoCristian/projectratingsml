Some lessons learned includes: project\n            structures which run parallel to municipal governments to\n            promote local development are a common feature of CDD\n            projects but efforts are needed from the start to link them\n            to municipal government and build cooperation, joint\n            planning and development synergies. To ensure Subprojects\n            (SP) and institutional development sustainability, SP\n            selection should be aligned to the extent possible with\n            central government and local government priorities and\n            plans. The quality and size of SPs are important for the\n            sustainability and credibility of the whole program. The\n            menu of eligible SPs should reflect national and\n            international development experience and not finance SPs\n            with high probable failure rates. Leadership training for\n            women in preparation for community leadership roles should\n            be part of the gender strategy. The Bank's fiduciary\n            procurement and financial management requirements applied to\n            communities moved the focus away from sound technical\n            implementation and organizational skills development. CDD is\n            arguably the best instrument in a centralized state where\n            working through the ministries is difficult and the\n            decentralization agenda has
