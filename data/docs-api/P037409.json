The largest single project item is the\n            first phase of the Ayalon expressway, designed as a\n            collector for interurban traffic and a distributor for\n            traffic through the main east-west arteries of Tel-Aviv. The\n            other works, most of which are situated in the densely\n            inhabited central part of the country, have been selected to\n            eliminate bottlenecks, reduce travel distances and permit\n            faster travel speeds. The loan would also finance some\n            additional equipment for the Central Roads Laboratory of PWD\n            for the testing of materials and soils, as well as weighing\n            devices for a proposed axle-load study and for the\n            enforcement of regulations regarding vehicle weights."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Israel - Second Highway Construction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Israel - Second Highway\n            Construction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1971/06/1556276/israel-second-highway-construction-project","projn":"IL-Highways Ii -- P037409","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Israel","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810190319048"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"axle loads,balance of payments,Bank of\n            Israel,borrowing,bottlenecks,Capital\n            expenditures,Construction,construction\n            materials,Construction Period,current prices,debt,Debt\n            service,district roads,economic\n            growth,employment,equilibrium,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,Export,fire,foreign exchange,Foreign\n            Exchange Reserves,freight,GNP,government spending,Gross\n            National Product,Highway,imports,interchanges,local\n            authorities,local contractors,main roads,passenger,passenger\n            transport,private consumption,public transport,Public\n            Works,Railways,range,Rate of Return,return on\n            investment,road improvements,savings,secondary\n            roads,soils,square,taxation,tractors,traffic,transport,urban\n            highways,urban traffic,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"axle loads,balance of payments,Bank of\n            Israel,borrowing,bottlenecks,Capital\n            expenditures,Construction,construction\n            materials,Construction Period,current prices,debt,Debt\n            service,district roads,economic\n            growth,employment,equilibrium,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,Export,fire,foreign exchange,Foreign\n            Exchange Reserves,freight,GNP,government spending,Gross\n            National Product,Highway,imports,interchanges,local\n            authorities,local contractors,main roads,passenger,passenger\n            transport,private consumption,public transport,Public\n            Works,Railways,range,Rate of Return,return on\n            investment,road improvements,savings,secondary\n            roads,soils,square,taxation,tractors,traffic,transport,urban\n            highways,urban traffic,vehicles"}},"owner":"Office of the President (EXC)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"P976"},"facets":{}}}
