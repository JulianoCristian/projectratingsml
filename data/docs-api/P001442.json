The project\n            was beset by implementation problems, some of which were\n            beyond its control, e.g. the country's macroeconomic\n            problems that caused liquidity shortages and led to frequent\n            suspension of disbursements by donors. The unfavorable\n            macro-economic situation, poor institutional environment and\n            the farmer's dissatisfaction with marketing\n            arrangements, all of which surfaced within the two years of\n            project implementation signaled that the project objectives\n            were unlikely to be achieved. Physical works such as feeder\n            roads and farm tracks construction and maintenance were\n            carried out in the first year of the project. Although the\n            project execution period was only half of that planned,\n            there are some clear and obvious lessons or findings among\n            which are the following: (a) Credit arrangements which are\n            vital to the success of a project should be completed early\n            in the project cycle. Even if the agronomic premises of a\n            project are sound, supervision missions and project\n            management must be aware of the need to constantly adapt and\n            innovate to suit local conditions and agricultural\n            practices. Conducive macro-economic and stable political\n            conditions, together with good governance, are essential\n            requirements for successful implementation of a project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Second Bong County Agricultural\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - Second Bong County\n            Agricultural Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/04/736553/liberia-second-bong-county-agricultural-development-project","projn":"LR-Bong Agric.
