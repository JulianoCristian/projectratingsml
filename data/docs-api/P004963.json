Some lessons learned\n            included: the government's objective of moving towards\n            a market economy was unlikely to be realized without a\n            commitment to shrink the size and favored status of the\n            public enterprises sector. The general question is whether\n            the Bank should support a reform program that it feels is\n            unlikely to meet its stated objectives with the measures\n            proposed, yet has enough important elements, such as trade\n            and price liberalization and audits of economic agents, that\n            need to be carried out in any event. The best solution is\n            probably to be more realistic, and therefore more modest, in\n            establishing the objectives of the reform program to fit the\n            measures that the government is willing to undertake.\n            Second, legal reforms are easily undermined by failure to\n            promulgate implementing decrees or by other regulations or\n            practices that counter the spirit of the reform. While it is\n            difficult to ensure that this will not happen, Bank staff\n            should be aware of this risk and attempt to protect against\n            it to the extent practical, by specifying, for example,\n            legal requirements on implementing decrees and institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Enterprise and\n            Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/06/733505/algeria-enterprise-financial-sector-adjustment-loan-project","projn":"DZ-Enter.& Fin.

For the enterprise sector, the program supports\n            reforms in five key areas.  First, the rapid introduction of\n            competition through the use of market based pricing and\n            allocation systems. Second, a proactive approach to the\n            development of the private sector.  Third, the\n            implementation of the process of \"corporatization\"\n            for public enterprises aimed at separating the roles of the\n            State as owner and as regulator of economic activity.\n            Fourth, initiating the process of restructuring of public\n            enterprises, with a special focus on the largest loss-making\n            public enterprises, and fifth, developing a program to\n            mitigate the social costs of enterprise restructuring.  In\n            the financial sector, the loan will support reforms in four\n            areas.  First, limiting the role of the Treasury as an agent\n            for financial intermediation and reforming its relationship\n            with the Central Bank.  Second, rationalizing interest rate\n            and credit policies.  Third, establishing a prudential,\n            regulatory and accounting framework for the banking system\n            together with a strengthening of the Central Bank, and\n            fourth, starting a multi-year program to restructure the\n            portfolio of existing banks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Enterprise and\n            Financial Sector Adjustment Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/05/735638/algeria-enterprise-financial-sector-adjustment-loan-project","projn":"DZ-Enter.& Fin.
