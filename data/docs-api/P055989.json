Although the macroeconomic situation\n            has improved, economic sustainability is dependent upon a\n            continued decline in inflation and real interest rates.\n            Further, in line with the Medium Term Expenditure Framework\n            (MTEF), resources need to be delivered to ministries, even\n            though expenditure restraints are still necessary.\n            Therefore, the fiscal program is heavily balanced on tax\n            revenue increases, external funding recovery, and, domestic\n            interest rates and payments reduction. The possibility of\n            another bout of fiscal excess is a major risk to the\n            program, coupled with demands for salary increases by public\n            servants; but the impetus for structural reforms remains\n            strong. The key lessons learned show that with effort and\n            cooperation, the Bank is in a position to deliver timely\n            assistance quite rapidly, recognized by the identification\n            and decision to pursue a fast track operation. Policy\n            reforms may often be delayed in a maturing democracy, due to\n            the need for consensus build-up; but, in turn, this process\n            may well safeguard reforms by forming a coalition and\n            building the momentum for change. Additional efforts to\n            strengthen the government's ownership in divestiture\n            programs, may enhance the effectiveness of adjustment and\n            technical assistance instruments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Economic Reform Support Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Economic Reform Support\n            Operation
