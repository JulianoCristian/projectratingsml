Some lessons learned included: it\n            provided Farmer Organization or FOs with the opportunity to\n            improve their capacity in achieving their goals based on\n            market and agro-ecological conditions within which they\n            operate. Training provided to farmers and the first-hand\n            experience of FO members in participatory planning, proposal\n            preparation, Farmer-managed extension activity, or FMA\n            implementation, simple monitoring, and the financial\n            management of grant funds gave them confidence and the\n            incentive to manage their own learning activities and\n            business enterprises more effectively. Under the project,\n            the successful dissemination of technology depended on\n            strong collaboration between farmers, researchers and field\n            extension workers, using participatory, learning-by-doing\n            dissemination approaches and involving the provision of\n            intensive research support by scientists who developed the\n            technologies. A lesson from the FEATI Project and from\n            experience elsewhere is that farmers will adopt improved\n            technologies faster if they participate in the field\n            assessment and in the fine tuning of the technologies\n            through farmer-managed demonstrations, farmer research\n            trials, field days, multi-media information campaigns, and\n            other similar activities. In the project, early technology\n            adopters included the farmer cooperators and technology\n            demonstrators involved in these activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Farmer

About 589 new rural\n            extension centers have been built and 200 existing ones\n            renovated. A key focus now is to scale up Farmer Managed\n            Activities to the district and provincial levels.

Farmer Empowerment through\n            Agriculture Technology and Information Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Farmer Empowerment\n            through Agriculture Technology and Information Project for\n            Indonesia is to develop a demand-driven, market oriented\n            agricultural services system, based on partnerships between\n            farmer groups, public agencies and private sector\n            enterprises at all levels. A formal request for\n            restructuring was received from the Project Implementation\n            Unit (PIU) on October 25, 2010, followed by a request from\n            the Ministry of Finance on August 2011 and submission by the\n            Ministry of Agriculture to the Bank of a satisfactory\n            financing and action plans to support the project's\n            extension. The restructuring is intended to reflect the\n            necessary changes during implementation, harmonize the\n            various documentations compared to the original project\n            appraisal document (PAD), and simplify procedures. These\n            will help accelerate implementation and disbursement,\n            improve project performance and achieve the project\n            development objectives. This is a second order restructuring\n            and the major modifications being proposed are: (a) revision\n            of the design of farmer-managed grants (FMA) related\n            activities under component one to simplify the\n            implementation procedures; (b) cancellation of selected\n            activities under Component two and five; (c) decrease in the\n            number of participating districts from 71 to 68 (as a result\n            of 3 districts being dropped), and the number of\n            participating villages from 3,230 to 3,060; (d) modification\n            of key performance indicators and results framework; and (e)\n            a six months extension of the closing date from June 30th\n            2012 to December 31st 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -
