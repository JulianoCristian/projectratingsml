The lessons learned indicate\n            that the project experience underscores importance of a\n            careful design and supervision of implementation mechanism\n            for technical assistance in projects that aim at sector\n            reform and incorporate pilot sector reform initiatives.\n            While evaluation studies are necessary, planning and\n            launching too many studies without an action plan and\n            framework for implementation of their recommendations should\n            be avoided. Sector reform projects have to incorporate and\n            generate a well-designed monitoring and evaluation system\n            for assessing the project outcome and the priority needs of\n            the sector, especially when follow-up operations are\n            planned, or when substantial risks are identified at project\n            entry. Improvement of local revenue generation and\n            collection should be supported by the project through a\n            well-targeted and realistic program of activities. If the\n            overall efficiency of municipal management is among the\n            development objectives of a municipal project, a clear\n            distinction should be made between activities supporting the\n            organizational efficiency (improving and rationalizing\n            internal procedures and tools), and those that are targeting\n            better institutional efficiency of the sector (improving\n            incentive frameworks and regulatory environments). Focus\n            only on organizational efficiency is limited in its impact\n            on the sector reform. The project's pilot\n            interventions, even if designed to test new approaches,\n            should be based on some degree of prior sector analysis.\n            Typically, systemic inefficiencies in the management\n            practices of local governments are predictable risks to\n            pilot operations and should be mitigated. The ideal\n            municipal project is planned and delivered in a\n            participatory manner by the municipality according to its\n            capacity. That would in most cases remove the need to devise\n            national and hence, uniform, approaches to reaching the poor\n            members of the communities, be it through national upgrading\n            programs or through special institutional arrangements for\n            micro-project initiatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Municipal Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Second Municipal\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/2851239/tunisia-second-municipal-development-project","projn":"TN-Municipal Dev.
