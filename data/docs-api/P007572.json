The project is not expected to\n            have any harmful effects on the environment. Although\n            opening up new lands and creating open areas may have some\n            effect on the biological life in Tamaulipas, over 22,500 ha\n            in the proposed project area are to be retained as a\n            wildlife reserve."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
