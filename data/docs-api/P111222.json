Some lessons learned included: efforts to\n            support institutions and capacity building were seen to be\n            worthwhile, in order to consolidate progress made on various\n            reform efforts. Accordingly, the DPFIS continued support for\n            capacity building initiatives, with parallel Institutional\n            Development Fund (IDF) grants and other measures. Providing\n            assistance through cross sectoral programmatic support\n            helped to sustain momentum in the Royak Government of\n            Bhutan's (RGoB's) efforts to implement its reform\n            program. The convening power of the Ministry of Finance\n            (MoF) as the focal ministry for programmatic support helps\n            to ensure that line ministries remain on-track for achieving\n            agreed targets in specific sectors. Identifying good\n            indicators upfront to gauge progress can be difficult,\n            especially in a country with limited capacity and data. The\n            DPFIS experience also shows the difficulty in finding\n            suitable indicators of progress, when attribution is\n            difficult. In particular, given the short timespan covered\n            by the DPFIS operation, it was difficult to find outcome\n            indicators that would show improvement by the close of the\n            operation. The Development Policy Credit (DPC) series is\n            making special efforts to rely on quantitative and\n            qualitative progress indicators that can be measured within\n            the life of the series. Despite the small size of Bhutan and\n            the high costs of operations, it was important and\n            worthwhile to sustain a close engagement, as there are\n            strong impacts of Bank interventions in a small economy.\n            Accordingly, the DPFIS sought to deepen the engagement for\n            wider and longer-lasting impacts, and for ensuring\n            sustainability of the reforms from the earlier Development\n            Policy Grand (DPG) series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Development Policy Financing for\n            Institutional

The First Development Policy Grant\n            (DPG1) provided US$15 million in budget support in FY06 to\n            help the RGoB meet selected development goals, and\n            contributed to deepening the policy dialogue. Based on\n            continued good progress on the medium-term reform program, a\n            Second Development Policy Grant (DPG2) for US$12 million was\n            approved in May 2007, and was linked to strengthening the\n            reform program and quickening the pace of implementation.\n            Both operations have closed, and have satisfactorily\n            achieved their development objectives.
