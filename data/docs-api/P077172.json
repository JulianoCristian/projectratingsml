Following are some\n            factors that conditioned program implementation, and thus\n            become important lessons for future operations. There is an\n            urgent need for the Bank to monitor the economic and\n            financial situation of Uruguay more closely. This was\n            evident given both the 2000 Country Assistance Strategy\n            (CAS), as well as the Bank work in the financial sector\n            early in 2002, failed to perceive the risks threatening the\n            Uruguayan economy, as a result of the financial crisis in\n            Argentina, which hindered the initial preparation of the\n            operation. Had the program been backed by stronger\n            foundation within the CAS, and by the Bank's economic\n            and sector work, there would have been greater information,\n            and closeness with government officials, which no doubt\n            would have led to an improved operation. Notwithstanding,\n            actions implemented by the Bank team helped overcome some\n            serious problems, such as the lack of a unified social\n            policy authority in the country to act as a counterpart,\n            forcing a program design and supervision at preparation with\n            no Government support. As it happened, the Ministry of\n            Economy was just a contact facilitator, with no power to\n            develop the preparation of the program, particularly\n            regarding social protection. Furthermore, there is need to\n            maintain a dialogue with the Government on relevant\n            structural reforms/policy actions with a long-term\n            sustainable impact on the social sectors. A more consistent\n            social development strategy would have helped design a more\n            ambitious reform agenda. In retrospect, the project was\n            effective given the seemingly medium and long term\n            sustainable impact, in areas such as transparency,\n            coherency, safety net, social information, and, monitoring\n            and evaluation of the programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay - Structural Adjustment\n            Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6057881/uruguay-structural-adjustment-loan-project","projn":"UY-Uruguay Structural Adjustment Loan (Prem)\n            -- P077172","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Uruguay","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050712105916"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Banking,Other social services,Housing finance,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Central government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Finance,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"structural adjustment; Policy framework;\n            Regulatory framework; Social administration; Authority;\n            Government role; Financial crisis; Bank's\n            responsiveness to client needs; Financial crisis;\n            Macroeconomic analysis; Macroeconomic context;"}},"owner":"Economic Policy Sector (LCSPE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Structural Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"32617"},"5161509":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/10/5161509/uruguay-structural-adjustment-loan-sal-special-structural-adjustment-loan-project-release-second-tranche-waiver-two-conditions","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/10/5161509/uruguay-structural-adjustment-loan-sal-special-structural-adjustment-loan-project-release-second-tranche-waiver-two-conditions","new_url":"2004/10/5161509/uruguay-structural-adjustment-loan-sal-special-structural-adjustment-loan-project-release-second-tranche-waiver-two-conditions","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/10/05/000160016_20041005152206/Rendered/INDEX/301350UY.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/10/05/000160016_20041005152206/Rendered/PDF/301350UY.pdf","loan_no":"7137","datestored":"2004-10-05T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-10-04T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL)\n            and Special Structural Adjustment Loan Project : release of\n            the second tranche and waiver of two conditions"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Structural\n            Adjustment Loan (SAL) and Special Structural Adjustment Loan\n            (SSAL) at the time o f the acute banking and economic crisis\n            in July 2002 were to contribute to fiscal adjustment, reform\n            the National Mortgage Bank (BHU), protect social programs,\n            improve the efficiency of social expenditures and reform the\n            unemployment insurance regime. The program was part of a\n            concerted effort with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to support\n            Uruguay's efforts to withstand the impact o f strong\n            external shocks, address domestic weaknesses and set the\n            stage for sustainable growth over the medium and long term.\n            As a result of tight fiscal, monetary and financial sector\n            policies and reforms, Uruguay was able to reverse the\n            downward trend in bank deposits, freely float its exchange\n            rate without jeopardizing price stability, and reduce\n            sovereign risk premia to manageable levels.
