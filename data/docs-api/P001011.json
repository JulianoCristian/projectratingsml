Lessons drawn from the project suggest\n            that given uncertain political environments, Technical\n            Assistance (TA) projects should provide enough flexibility,\n            and be adequately supervised to withstand adversity, and\n            respond to changing circumstances. These factors were\n            critical in ensuring the project's successful\n            achievement of objectives. Furthermore, beneficiaries should\n            have sufficient capacity to ensure the transfer of necessary\n            skills, otherwise, training programs should be tailored\n            according to circumstances, and involve technical expertise\n            in curriculum design. Again, this not only ensured the\n            responsiveness of training programs to TA, but the adequate\n            transfer of knowledge, as well. The project also confirms\n            that capacity building is a long-term undertaking,\n            particularly in evolving situations, as ownership of reforms\n            implies allowing for sufficient time to build consensus on\n            policy, and procedural changes for reforms to be\n            successfully sustainable. The strong Project Management\n            Unit's capacity in Bank procurement guidelines, and\n            disbursement procedures, proved essential to the successful\n            project results, in an otherwise difficult situation, given\n            the weak institutional capacity, and political constraints.\n            Finally, TA projects can be instrumental in assisting in the\n            post-conflict restoration of public administration services,\n            evidenced by the project's re-establishment of\n            budgetary systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Economic
