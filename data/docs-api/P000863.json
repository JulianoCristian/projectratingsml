The\n            objectives of the project were to continue the Bank's\n            involvement in the agricultural sector including policy\n            areas, strategy for development, production of improved\n            planting material, and improved cultivation technology;\n            diversification away from cocoa, import substitution; and\n            continued development of investments made in the Oil Pam\n            Development Project First Phase. Lessons learned: The\n            project has shown that establishing a nucleus plantation\n            linked to outgrower holdings is viable under the conditions\n            of: (i) a simple project design; (ii) autonomy to operate as\n            a business entity; (iii) efficient and competent management;\n            and (iv) provision of adequate amounts of local counterpart\n            funds.

However, the\n            project faces risks related to: (a) the high rate of\n            domestic inflation which, if it continues, could lead to\n            cost over-runs, and (b) the availability of foreign exchange\n            to meet recurrent costs of imported farm inputs. However, in\n            view of satisfactory experience with the Government's\n            contributions under Phase I, and assuming continued efforts\n            by the Government at containing inflation, these risks are\n            significantly reduced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
