Lessons have been\n            incorporated into subsequent operations, suggesting on: 1)\n            road network issues: a broader road space management, and\n            network planning, for had the Bank accepted the basic\n            Shanghai Municipal Government's concept of a \"ring\n            and cross\" viaduct network, working with city agencies\n            towards an integrated network design, greater impacts, and a\n            more effective traffic management strategy could have been\n            achieved; 2) engineering design, construction, and\n            procurement: that although the Bank was initially cautious\n            on requiring engineering designs reviews for the ring road,\n            the seemingly expertise of the Shanghai Design Institutes\n            led to a participatory process, despite inexperience in\n            large elevated road designs, functional design shortcomings,\n            and quality of, and speediness in construction, which led to\n            construction delays, and cost increases. However, the\n            bidding process benefited, and stimulated the pace of reform\n            of related design, and construction companies: a fair, and\n            competitive construction market is emerging in Shanghai,\n            under standardized competitive procurement practices; 3)\n            traffic management: there is a need for institutional\n            integration with traffic engineering; to complement the\n            design of traffic management with traffic impact analysis;\n            and, the judicious use of loan conditions could ensure the\n            timely implementation of traffic management schemes; 4)\n            public transport reform: that wholesale privatization of\n            transport companies, is likely to be a slow process, mainly\n            on the basis of unacceptable political will to\n            privatization; and, 5) transport planning: that modal split\n            forecasting suggests an evolution towards lower shares of\n            public transport, favoring private means of transport,\n            potentially leading to road congestion, and loss or productivity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Shanghai
