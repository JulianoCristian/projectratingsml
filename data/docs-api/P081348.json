The\n            project implementation was unsatisfactory due to\n            difficulties with procurement, weakness in project\n            management, ineffective use of technical assistance and slow\n            response to management issues. Of the three project\n            development outcome indicators, two were partially achieved,\n            while the third was unsatisfactory. Significant lessons\n            learned during the implementation of the project include: 1)\n            hiring of consultants to help the borrower in project\n            preparation must start at project identification stage; 2) a\n            full understanding of the screening and selection criteria\n            by participating counties is important to ensure success; 3)\n            engagement of both a team of experts and a design institute\n            working in tandem to support the Project Management Offices\n            (PMOs) and Water Utility Companies (WUCs) in preparation of\n            a FSR (Financial Stability Report) is not practical; and 4)\n            programmatic loan with a framework for selecting and\n            appraising subprojects could have

Henan Towns Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for China is to assist the\n            borrower's Henan province in expanding its water supply\n            and wastewater management services and improving the\n            institutional capacity of relevant institutions to plan,\n            regulate and operate such services. The changes are: 1)\n            reduction of project scope since some of the works no longer\n            need bank financing; 2) restructuring of the financing plan\n            and disbursement arrangements due to increasing costs and\n            appreciation of Chinese RMB; and, 3) revision of monitoring\n            indicators and results framework to reflect the restructured components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Henan Towns Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/11/16988022/china-henan-towns-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"CN-Henan Towns Water Supply And Sanitation\n            Project -- P081348","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Conservation,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20121122002510"},"theme":"Municipal governance and institution building,Water resource management,Urban services and housing for the poor,Regulation and competition policy,Pollution management and environmental health","subsc":"Sanitation,Water supply,Wastewater Treatment and Disposal,Wastewater Collection and Transportation,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"collection networks, construction,\n            counterpart funding, intake structures, municipalities,\n            Number of people with access, pipelines, population growth,\n            SANITATION, small towns, TOWNS, Wastewater, Wastewater\n            Management, wastewater services, wastewater treatment,\n            wastewater treatment facilities, wastewater treatment\n            plants, water distribution, water distribution networks,\n            water production, WATER SUPPLY, water supply facilities"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia Sustainable Dev (EASCS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"73721"},"16988026":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/11/16988026/china-henan-towns-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/11/16988026/china-henan-towns-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","new_url":"2012/11/16988026/china-henan-towns-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","disclosure_date":"2012-11-21T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-11-21T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-11-21T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/11/22/000356161_20121122002811/Rendered/INDEX/NonAsciiFileName0.doc.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/11/22/000356161_20121122002811/Rendered/PDF/NonAsciiFileName0.doc.pdf","loan_no":"4829","datestored":"2012-11-22T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-11-20T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"China - Henan Towns Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Henan Towns Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project for China is to assist the\n            borrower's Henan province in expanding its water supply\n            and wastewater management services and improving the\n            institutional capacity of relevant institutions to plan,\n            regulate and operate such services.
