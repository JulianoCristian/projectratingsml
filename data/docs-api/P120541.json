Some lessons learned included: the\n            DPL, particularly when it is limited to one year, is not an\n            efficient instrument to promote institutional reforms in the\n            education sector. Reform processes in the education sector\n            should go through long successive phases without\n            interruption (development, consultation, feasibility study,\n            and a pilot before a full scale implementation) to be\n            successful. The decentralization to the regional academy of\n            education and training (academie regionale d\u0092education et de\n            formation) (AREFs) is essential for assessing the needs,\n            locating investments, targeting social programs, motivating\n            teaching staff, assessing quality, and more broadly\n            achieving better sector performance. To measure quality,\n            national learning assessments should be frequent, procedures\n            should be standard, and results should be disseminated\n            widely at the school level and to all stakeholders. The\n            establishment of internal audit units in the AREFs was a\n            useful action. Teachers' pre- service training\n            (university education programs (filieres universitaires de\n            l\u0092education) (FUE) and regional centers for education and\n            training (centres regionaux metier education et formation)\n            (CRMEF)) should be assessed urgently to determine the\n            corrective measures necessary to improve its quality and
