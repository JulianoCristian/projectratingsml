While far from a\n            \"new\" lesson learned, the project illustrates once\n            again the need for sustained increased public basic\n            education spending if this type of investment is to fully\n            succeed. The Bank needs to be even more proactive in\n            insisting not only on timely and sufficient allocation of\n            project counterpart funds for project execution, but also on\n            overall increases in funding for the sub-sectors targeted\n            for investment. Institutional capacity-building involves a\n            cultural shift which requires strong leadership by example\n            at all levels, including demonstration of the use of\n            information for decision-making and clear designation of\n            roles and responsibilities for accountability. It also\n            requires continuity of staff and a degree of immunity from\n            political changes above. So long as shifts in presidential\n            power result in massive sweeps and/or relocations of civil\n            servants, based on political party affiliation, efforts to\n            improve institutional capacity are unlikely to produce\n            lasting results. Simply encouraging parents and community\n            leaders to get involved in school management is not enough.\n            Parents require training, empowerment (authorization) and\n            some control over financial resources to get engaged. School\n            nutrition programs (desayuno escolar) are an important\n            incentive for student attendance and retention at school.\n            In-service teacher training programs should be grounded in\n            the practical teaching and learning realities of classrooms,\n            rather than based on prevailing academic theories of\n            education. Secondly, a clear definition of the\n            teaching/learning objectives sought through in-service\n            training is necessary to ensure both selection of\n            high-quality institutions capable for providing this\n            training and downstream impact measurement. There must be\n            some mechanism to assess school performance before and after\n            training, including links to teacher performance. Offering\n            both scholarships and higher salaries for diplomas certainly\n            encourages teachers to participate in training, but actual\n            training impact is likely to be higher and more\n            cost-effective if teachers participate financially, as well.\n            Co-financed projects require very careful project design and\n            particular attention to the distribution of financing by\n            components, sub-components and categories of investment.\n            Ensuring synchronization of financier timelines is also\n            essential to avoid debilitating \"starts and stops\"\n            in project execution. Equally important for co-financed\n            projects, is the harmonization of World Bank and IDB\n            procurement procedures.  Efforts to improve project\n            implementation through initiatives such as the\n            Implementation Improvement Support Group can indeed be very\n            effective, particularly when this is combined with\n            flexibility on the part of Bank task managers to make needed\n            adjustments on its side. Project design must allow for\n            considerable flexibility over a 5-6 year implementation\n            period, given the high probability of changes in Government,\n            task team leaders and external environments. Ensuring that\n            Secretariat of Education personnel are ultimately\n            responsible for project execution (NOT the project\n            coordination unit) significantly improves
