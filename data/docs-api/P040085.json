Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) A demand-driven, market-based\n            model of institutional strengthening generates wider social\n            capacities, increases the number of suppliers and improves\n            local actors' managerial capacities; 2) Restricting the\n            participatory planning process to the municipal territory\n            may not necessarily be conducive to optimal decision-making;\n            3) The coherence between the longer-term municipal\n            development plans (PDMs) and the annual operational plans\n            (POA) are not necessarily automatic. Concerted efforts are\n            needed to guarantee coherence between planning and\n            implementation; 4) The complexity of the M&E indicators\n            needs to be related to the institutional capacity of the\n            user; 5) Outsourcing training services to formal and\n            established training institutions, such as universities,\n            could result in a more sustainable institutionality for\n            supplying these services in the future; 6) Participatory\n            demand identification needs to be complemented with solid\n            technical inputs in order to ensure adequate ranking of\n            development priorities for the communities; 7) The spot\n            improvement approach for low-volume rural roads reduces unit\n            costs, reduces environmental impacts and has a greater\n            likelihood of ensuring year-round access than traditional\n            approaches. 8) Reductions in transportation costs across all\n            sectors and activities prove that rural roads can be\n            justified on the basis of improving access to services\n            (health, education, etc.) and not necessarily on the basis\n            of production increases; 9) It should not be assumed that\n            municipalities will allocate sufficient resources for the\n            cost of operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure\n            built or rehabilitated with the project; and 10) As the\n            experience with \"emergency\" subprojects showed,\n            the subproject cycle can be simplified, identification\n            focused on technical aspects and implementation more clearly\n            delegated to municipalities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Participatory Rural Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Participatory Rural\n            Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/7591674/bolivia-participatory-rural-investment-project","projn":"BO-Participatory Rural Investment Project -- P040085","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Environmental Economics & Policies,Municipal Financial Management,Non Bank Financial Institutions,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Urban Development,Environment","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070509112940"},"subsc":"General transportation sector,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Other industry,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Urban Development,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, Accounting, accounting\n            records, Administrative costs, auditors, average costs,\n            civil service, cost-effectiveness, debt, Decentralization,\n            deconcentration, direct financing, Economic Development,\n            Economic growth, economic shocks, Environmental,\n            environmental impacts, environmental management, Exchange\n            Rate, expenditures, farm income, Financial Analysis,\n            financial management, financial resources, financial\n            transfers, fiscal deficits, fishing, forestry, government\n            intervention, incidence of poverty, income, income poverty,\n            Indigenous peoples, inflation, institutional capacity,\n            institutional development, Irrigation, lack of incentives,\n            Latin American, laws, local administration, local\n            governments, mandates, Municipal, Municipal Accounting,\n            Municipal Development, municipal governments, municipal\n            procurement, municipal revenue, municipalities, natural\n            resources, operating costs, participatory management, policy\n            environment, Poor, poverty gap, Poverty Reduction, Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,\n            prefectures, Present Value, producers, resources management,\n            Rural, rural areas, Rural Communities, rural community,\n            Rural Development, rural families, rural growth, Rural\n            Investment, rural population, rural producers, rural road,\n            rural roads, savings, social services, structural reforms,\n            Sustainable Development, technical assistance"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF023256-BOLIVIA-PARTICIPATORY RURAL\n            INVESTMENT PROJECT,TF023549-BOLIVIA-PARTICIPATORY RURAL\n            INVESTMENT PROJECT-REC.

construction of longitudinal drainage crossing\n            primary and secondary roads as well as hillsides; control of\n            wastewater, runoff, and garbage from the worksite to avoid\n            damage to river beds and aquatic life; prevention of oil and\n            fuel leaks from machinery and vehicles; synchronized usage\n            of machinery and vehicles in order to reduce air emissions;\n            relocation of displaced human settlements; management of\n            liquid flows to water bodies; and control of solid wastes,\n            liquid flows, and gaseous emissions during the\n            project's operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Participatory Rural Investment\n            Project - environmental impact analysis"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia: Proyecto Participativo\n            de Inversi\u00f3n Rural - An\u00e1lisis de impacto ambiental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/12/438308/bolivia-participatory-rural-investment-project-environmental-impact-analysis","projn":"BO-Participatory Rural Investment Project -- P040085","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Environmental Governance,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment","count":"Bolivia","authors":{"authr":"Szauer, Maria Teresa"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980312102509"},"subsc":"Other social services,Irrigation and drainage,Sub-national government administration,General transportation sector,Other industry","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1998-2","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative\n            procedures,deforestation,enforcement\n            mechanisms,environmental assessments,Environmental\n            Audit,Environmental costs,environmental\n            criteria,environmental damage,environmental\n            effects,Environmental Evaluation,environmental\n            impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental legislation,environmental\n            management,environmental measures,Environmental\n            Monitoring,environmental performance,Environmental\n            Policy,Evaluation Criteria,forestry,infrastructure\n            projects,mitigation measures,monitoring data,Monitoring\n            Plans,Municipal Development,municipal\n            governments,municipalities,natural resource,natural resource\n            management,Natural Resources,Natural Resources\n            Management,pilot projects,Programs,Project\n            Evaluation,Project Management,Rural\n            Communities,screening,sustainable development,watershed"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative\n            procedures,deforestation,enforcement\n            mechanisms,environmental assessments,Environmental\n            Audit,Environmental costs,environmental\n            criteria,environmental damage,environmental\n            effects,Environmental Evaluation,environmental\n            impact,Environmental Impact Assessment,environmental\n            impacts,environmental legislation,environmental\n            management,environmental measures,Environmental\n            Monitoring,environmental performance,Environmental\n            Policy,Evaluation Criteria,forestry,infrastructure\n            projects,mitigation measures,monitoring data,Monitoring\n            Plans,Municipal Development,municipal\n            governments,municipalities,natural resource,natural resource\n            management,Natural Resources,Natural Resources\n            Management,pilot projects,Programs,Project\n            Evaluation,Project Management,Rural\n            Communities,screening,sustainable development,watershed"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF023551-BOLIVIA-PARTICIPATORY RURAL\n            INVESTMENT PROJECT-BANK EXE.,TF023256-BOLIVIA-PARTICIPATORY RURAL\n            INVESTMENT PROJECT,TF036567-BOLIVIA - RURAL INVESTMENT PROJECT,TF035668-BOLIVIA - RURAL INVESTMENT PROJECT,TF035469-LAC REGION - GENDER CAPACITY BUILDING,TF034569-CROATIA -FARMER SUPPORT SERVICES,TF034295-BOLIVIA - RURAL COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT,TF023549-BOLIVIA-PARTICIPATORY RURAL\n            INVESTMENT PROJECT-REC.
