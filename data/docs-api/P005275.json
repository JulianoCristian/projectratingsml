The Government decided to\n            postpone the implementation of the proposed Aqaba power\n            station extension and on April 13, 1988, the Government\n            requested the Bank to withdraw the loan. Four important\n            lessons were learned during processing of the project. (a)\n            The first lesson learned was that information on subsectors\n            that has an impact on the project should be updated at\n            regular intervals. (b) The second lesson learned was that\n            even though good quality power system planning was\n            undertaken consistent with best practice at the time,\n            changes that occurred in oil and coal prices, electricity\n            demand, and fuel availability (natural gas) indicate that\n            more formal analysis of risks and their impact on project\n            design might have led to better investment decisions. (c)\n            The third lesson learned was that it is essential to\n            address, well in advance, transnational environmental issues\n            in case a polluting source, such as a power station, is\n            close to the border of the country. (d) The fourth lesson\n            learned was that it is important to maintain continuity, at\n            least for one year, of the appraisal team, especially, the\n            task manager, for follow-up actions after the approval of\n            the project by the Board."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Seventh Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Seventh Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/11/733335/jordan-seventh-power-project","projn":"JO-Power VII Aqaba 2 -- P005275","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Water and Industry,Carbon Policy and Trading,Oil Refining & Gas Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Jordan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970311115354"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acceptable limits,air quality,alternative\n            fuel,boilers,coal,coal prices,construction,cooling,cooling\n            water,demand for electricity,demand forecast,electricity\n            demand,electricity generation,emission,energy\n            resources,environmental assessment,extraction,fuel,fuel\n            availability,fuel oil,fuel oil prices,fugitive dust,gas\n            exploration,gas field,gas reserves,gas turbines,heavy fuel\n            oil,natural gas,natural gas reserves,oil prices,oil\n            shale,OPEC,particulate matter,petroleum,petroleum\n            exploration,pollutants,power generation,power\n            station,recoverable gas,small hydropower,thermal power,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"acceptable limits,air quality,alternative\n            fuel,boilers,coal,coal prices,construction,cooling,cooling\n            water,demand for electricity,demand forecast,electricity\n            demand,electricity generation,emission,energy\n            resources,environmental assessment,extraction,fuel,fuel\n            availability,fuel oil,fuel oil prices,fugitive dust,gas\n            exploration,gas field,gas reserves,gas turbines,heavy fuel\n            oil,natural gas,natural gas reserves,oil prices,oil\n            shale,OPEC,particulate matter,petroleum,petroleum\n            exploration,pollutants,power generation,power\n            station,recoverable gas,small hydropower,thermal power,wells"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"16104"},"739771":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/05/739771/jordan-seventh-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/05/739771/jordan-seventh-power-project","new_url":"1987/05/739771/jordan-seventh-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/05/01/000009265_3970625091607/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/05/01/000009265_3970625091607/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2835","docdt":"1987-05-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1987-05-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Seventh Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Seventh Power Project is part of the\n            Jordan Electricity Authority's (JEA) high priority\n            1988-95 investment program for the development of\n            Jordan's power subsector and includes:  (i) the\n            expansion of the existing sea-water-cooled steam power plant\n            at Aqaba by the addition of 2x130-MW units initially firing\n            heavy fuel oil and with the boilers and power station layout\n            suitable for future coal firing.
