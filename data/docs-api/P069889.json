Some lessons learned included: the\n            inclusion of too many components in a project (six in this\n            case) negatively affects implementation, because both the\n            client and the Bank have limited resources for effective\n            supervision and implementation. When clients have limited\n            capacity to begin with, it may be prudent to limit\n            components to fewer with a similar implementation format.\n            Similarly, the project should not have too many indicators.\n            Fewer, measurable and objective monitoring indicators and a\n            well designed evaluation system will better assess the\n            baselines and subsequently achievement of project outcomes.\n            Special measures should also be introduced to ensure top\n            caliber consultants are appointed when local capacity is\n            weak. In this case inferior consultants paid on a time basis\n            were in effect rewarded because of the project delays. The\n            project should have adequate contingency arrangements in\n            line with Bank norms. Bio-engineering measures using local\n            bamboo and traditional techniques may be used to stabilize\n            landslide-prone hill sides. This promotes local employment\n            generation. The success of using such techniques in this\n            project has led to replication in areas such as Himachal\n            Pradesh. Debris disposed in an environmentally friendly\n            manner can also benefit the community. In the Mizoram\n            project the debris provided a unique opportunity to create\n            football pitches and water storage ponds for the local community."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
