The Beilungang Thermal Power Extension\n            Project was designed to support industrial growth in East\n            China by increasing electricity supply to the East China\n            Grid, which was suffering from acute power shortages. Bank\n            performance from project preparation through completion was\n            satisfactory. The Bank maintained good relations with the\n            borrower, the beneficiary and the consultants throughout\n            project execution. Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Bureau\n            (ZPEPB) successfully completed the major project components\n            in spite of many difficulties. Key lessons learned from the\n            project were: (a) Although the design parameters of the\n            major equipment were selected on the basis of fully-proven\n            designs, the project experienced many defects in design and\n            workmanship of the major equipment. This experience\n            suggested the need for more stringent quality assurance\n            systems in both ZPEPB and the contractors. (b) Regarding\n            island-based procurement management, the number of contract\n            packages should be minimized to the extent possible to\n            reduce interfacing problems. (c) The effectiveness of\n            consulting services, particularly for construction\n            management, benefits from inputs by international experts.\n            (d) The devaluation of the US dollar against European and\n            Japanese currencies resulted in the beneficiary's loss\n            of $13 million. Measures to avoid or minimize risks related\n            to foreign currency movements should be sought."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Beilungang Thermal Power Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -

The government gives high\n            priority to electric power development, with a strategy that\n            combines expanding generating capacity by developing and\n            financing thermal stations. The Beilungang Thermal Power\n            Extension Project seeks to: (a) alleviate the acute power\n            shortage of a major load center in East China; (b) support\n            the national policies of developing large, coal-fired\n            thermal power generating units; and (c) continue the effort\n            to introduce the modern technology in plant design and\n            construction management. The proposed project also (d)\n            provides technical assistance to ZPEPB (Zhejiang Provincial\n            Electric Power Bureau) for reorganizing its operation and\n            strengthening its management. This assistance aims to\n            facilitate its transformation from a power bureau to a more\n            autonomous power entity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Beilungang Thermal Power Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Beilungang Thermal Power\n            Extension Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/05/739388/china-beilungang-thermal-power-extension-project","projn":"CN-Beilungang II -- P003553","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926184231"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,Agricultural\n            Output,agricultural uses,Air Quality,coal,coal\n            reserves,cogeneration,commercial\n            energy,Construction,consumption of\n            energy,covers,debt,distribution losses,economic\n            development,economic growth,effective use,efficiency of\n            energy use,electric locomotives,Electric Power,electrical\n            energy,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            Generation,electricity use,employment,Energy Balance,energy\n            conservation,Energy Consumption,energy efficiency,Energy\n            Generation,energy price,energy production,energy\n            resources,energy savings,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            supplies,Engineering,engineers,environmental\n            assessment,excavation,financial resources,fuel,fuel\n            consumption,fuel efficiency,fuels,generation\n            capacity,geological data,geothermal energy,geothermal\n            power,Grid,Grids,heat,Hydro Power,hydro\n            resources,Hydroelectric\n            power,income,inflation,lignite,living conditions,living\n            standards,marginal costs,mines,natural gas,nuclear\n            power,offshore oil,oil,oil reserves,oil\n            shale,pollution,pollution control,Power,power company,Power\n            Development,power enterprise,power generation,Power\n            Planning,power plant,power plants,Power Projects,Power\n            Sector,power stations,power supplies,power supply,Power\n            System,pressure,price changes,primary energy,quality\n            control,quotas,raw materials,rural\n            electrification,safety,shale oil,skilled\n            workers,structures,taxation,technicians,thermal power plants,transport,voltage"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,Agricultural\n            Output,agricultural uses,Air Quality,coal,coal\n            reserves,cogeneration,commercial\n            energy,Construction,consumption of\n            energy,covers,debt,distribution losses,economic\n            development,economic growth,effective use,efficiency of\n            energy use,electric locomotives,Electric Power,electrical\n            energy,electricity consumption,Electricity\n            Generation,electricity use,employment,Energy Balance,energy\n            conservation,Energy Consumption,energy efficiency,Energy\n            Generation,energy price,energy production,energy\n            resources,energy savings,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            supplies,Engineering,engineers,environmental\n            assessment,excavation,financial resources,fuel,fuel\n            consumption,fuel efficiency,fuels,generation\n            capacity,geological data,geothermal energy,geothermal\n            power,Grid,Grids,heat,Hydro Power,hydro\n            resources,Hydroelectric\n            power,income,inflation,lignite,living conditions,living\n            standards,marginal costs,mines,natural gas,nuclear\n            power,offshore oil,oil,oil reserves,oil\n            shale,pollution,pollution control,Power,power company,Power\n            Development,power enterprise,power generation,Power\n            Planning,power plant,power plants,Power Projects,Power\n            Sector,power stations,power supplies,power supply,Power\n            System,pressure,price changes,primary energy,quality\n            control,quotas,raw materials,rural\n            electrification,safety,shale oil,skilled\n            workers,structures,taxation,technicians,thermal power plants,transport,voltage"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia HQ Unit (EACCQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"7164"},"facets":{}}}
