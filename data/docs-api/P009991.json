Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: 1) financial\n            institutions that have been sheltered for a long time by a\n            highly regulated economic framework may need time and\n            assistance to adjust to a changing incentive structure.\n            Commitment by the borrower and the continuous support of its\n            top management in project implementation are essential to\n            project success; 2) gauging the institutional capacity to,\n            deal with complex export marketing issues is a lengthy\n            process. When designing export credit lines, the Bank should\n            not be overly optimistic about how long it will take to\n            establish this expertise. A key element of this project was\n            the export development fund for export promotion. Efforts\n            should be made to reproduce this kind of arrangement in\n            similar loans, but preferably on a self-sustained basis; 3)\n            the World Bank's willingness to finance export\n            promotion activities in parallel with a comprehensive and\n            well-designed program for trade policy reforms enabled it to\n            be an active participant in the evolving policy dialogue;\n            and 4) regular dialogue during project supervision between\n            Bank staff and the borrower contributed to timely resolution\n            of problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
