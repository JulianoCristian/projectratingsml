Some lessons learned included: success in\n            capacity building depends in large part on the commitment\n            evinced by the beneficiaries. This was evident in the Bank\n            of Mozambique (BOM) computerization; the creation and\n            implementation of the technical unit in the Ministry of\n            Finance (MOF) directorate of plan; and various training\n            actions. To generate that commitment from the start and\n            insure the best level of execution, borrowers should be\n            actively involved in project preparation and design. When\n            technical assistant (TA) consultants are selected, they\n            should be required to commit themselves to transfer their\n            own skills through on-the-job training. Skills transfer was\n            successfully achieved in the case of two main subcomponents:\n            the computerization at BOM and the creation of the Central\n            Technical Project Unit (UTCP) at Ministry of Plan and\n            Finance (MPF). In Mozambique, given the civil war being\n            fought as the credit was launched, a more realistic\n            implementation timetable should have been set, especially in\n            connection with recruiting TA consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -
