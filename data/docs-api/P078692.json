Some lessons learned included: throughout\n            the project period universities failed to provide reports to\n            Ministry of Education (MOE) on time. Universities enjoy\n            significant autonomy worldwide. Universities, as a rule,\n            resent frequent reporting to ministry officials on their\n            activities. The failure of the project in responding to the\n            changed priority resulted in the loss of the borrower's\n            ownership, and as a consequence, unsatisfactory project\n            outcomes. The project did not allocate funds for predefined\n            activities of universities but it allowed them to use\n            predetermined Institutional Development Grant (IDG) and\n            Development Innovation Fund (DIF) resources as per their own\n            choice.
