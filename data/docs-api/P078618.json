Ratings for the Strengthening Institutions\n            Development Policy Grant Project for Afghanistan were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Development\n            Policy Operations (DPO) can achieve important public\n            administration and financial management reforms in high-risk\n            environments with strong government ownership and flexible\n            implementation. Emergency consultant support in the short\n            and medium-term can usefully supplement the skill base in\n            Governments where progress in institution and capacity\n            building is bound to be a slow and time-consuming process.\n            These skilled personnel can help adopt structures,\n            processes, systems, laws, and regulations to enable reforms\n            in, inter alia, pay and grading, administrative reform\n            oversight, human resources monitoring, tax administration,\n            financial management, procurement, and audit. However,\n            ensuring the transition to a more normal administrative\n            structure is necessary for sustainability. It is crucial to\n            empower senior officials from Government to determine and\n            direct administrative reform, public financial management\n            and other institutional processes that make sense locally\n            and that can promote broad based consensus inclusive of key\n            political groups, while being sufficiently robust to deal\n            with

The main lessons learned\n            from these projects are: 1) For the PSIB II and III, the\n            Bank team made good use of both facets of the development\n            policy instrument. 2) The PSIB\u0092s experience emphasized the\n            opportunity to maximize synergies with other Bank\n            instruments and other donor programs. 3) It is vital to\n            carefully assess the political economy in each reform area\n            as well as ground development policy lending in high quality\n            AAA work. 4) The PSIB series succeeded in strengthening\n            institution building and important parts of the legal\n            regulatory framework, but capacity development will be a\n            long term undertaking. 5) The outcomes for the PSIB

The issue of weak capacity - notably to\n            carry out the legal reform agenda - should inform the design\n            of subsequent operations. Program ownership could be\n            strengthened, notably to ensure continuity in reform\n            implementation. The government could be encouraged to\n            enhance consultations, within government and with key\n            stakeholders, and communicate information about the reform\n            process and progress towards these objectives.

The\n            overall objective of  this operation is to deepen, broaden,\n            and sustain the reforms underway in the areas of public\n            administration and fiscal management. The operation builds\n            on the reforms initiated under the Emergency Public\n            Administration Projects (EPAP) of the International\n            Development Association to improve the GOA'S own\n            fiduciary standards.

The operation also supports the\n            implementation of  reforms that lead to a more efficient\n            allocation of  fiscal resources in the areas of  human\n            development (health, basic education and social protection)\n            and private sector development (investment climate,\n            financial sector, and state-owned enterprises). More\n            comprehensive, thematic reforms in human and private sector\n            development will require support through other instruments,\n            including sectoral operations and technical assistance.
