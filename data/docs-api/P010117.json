The project aimed to address immediate\n            manpower needs by trying to develop a university. As such,\n            It attempted too much. It assumed, that recently established\n            certificate and diploma programs would remain the basic\n            building blocks of the university system. Thus, it is clear\n            that two things were needed: (a) a long-term staff\n            development program, extending beyond the period of\n            implementation of this project, in order to ensure full\n            understanding of the magnitude and long-term nature of the\n            process of staff development; and (b) a slice of that\n            long-term program for implementation under this project that\n            was substantially larger and more aggressive in the pursuit\n            of advanced studies than the -program included in the\n            project. The design and implementation experience with this\n            project reinforces the lessons of other projects and\n            stresses some which are more particular to this project. It\n            is evident, in view of the relatively recent start on the\n            new certificate and degree programs, that an impact study\n            should be undertaken at a later stage, perhaps in four or\n            five years time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Technical Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Technical Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/03/738931/nepal-technical-education-project","projn":"NP-Technical Education -- P010117","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,General Technology,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960924202521"},"subsc":"Tertiary education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievement,addition,adult literacy,basic\n            education,basic needs,boarding,boarding facilities,civil\n            engineering,classrooms,Construction\n            Costs,Curricula,curriculum,curriculum design,curriculum\n            development,developed countries,development\n            program,drawing,Economic Development,education\n            institutions,education projects,education system,educational\n            development,educational objectives,EDUCATIONAL\n            OUTCOMES,Educational programmes,educational\n            quality,educators,effective teaching,Engineering,engineering\n            services,engineers,enrollment,enrollment ratio,enrolment\n            targets,feasibility studies,female participation,future\n            education,innovations,Institutional\n            development,Instruction,Instructional\n            materials,literacy,literacy rate,mathematics,poor\n            performance,population growth,practical activities,primary\n            education,primary school,primary school enrollment,reference\n            books,schooling,science laboratories,secondary\n            education,staff development,staff housing,student\n            admissions,student places,study tours,subject\n            areas,teacher,teacher training,teachers,Teaching,teaching\n            manuals,Teaching Materials,teaching methods,teaching\n            programmes,teaching programs,Teaching Staff,Technical\n            Assistance,technical drawings,Technical Education,technical\n            teacher training,technicians,total costs,training\n            programme,training programs,Vocational Training,work experience"},"1":{"cdata!":"achievement,addition,adult literacy,basic\n            education,basic needs,boarding,boarding facilities,civil\n            engineering,classrooms,Construction\n            Costs,Curricula,curriculum,curriculum design,curriculum\n            development,developed countries,development\n            program,drawing,Economic Development,education\n            institutions,education projects,education system,educational\n            development,educational objectives,EDUCATIONAL\n            OUTCOMES,Educational programmes,educational\n            quality,educators,effective teaching,Engineering,engineering\n            services,engineers,enrollment,enrollment ratio,enrolment\n            targets,feasibility studies,female participation,future\n            education,innovations,Institutional\n            development,Instruction,Instructional\n            materials,literacy,literacy rate,mathematics,poor\n            performance,population growth,practical activities,primary\n            education,primary school,primary school enrollment,reference\n            books,schooling,science laboratories,secondary\n            education,staff development,staff housing,student\n            admissions,student places,study tours,subject\n            areas,teacher,teacher training,teachers,Teaching,teaching\n            manuals,Teaching Materials,teaching methods,teaching\n            programmes,teaching programs,Teaching Staff,Technical\n            Assistance,technical drawings,Technical Education,technical\n            teacher training,technicians,total costs,training\n            programme,training programs,Vocational Training,work experience"}},"owner":"S.A.
