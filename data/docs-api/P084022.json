Some\n            lessons learned included: the willingness of the Government\n            of Senegal (GoS) to move forward with decentralization\n            agenda, during and after the project, cannot occur without\n            clear frameworks and a strong enabling environment. A\n            clearer legal framework is needed to support the development\n            of contract management agency (CMA) beyond public works\n            executing agency (agence d'execution de travaux\n            d'interet public pour l'emploi) (AGETIP) and\n            evolution of the municipal development agency (agence de\n            developpement municipal) (MDA) as an institution focused on\n            financing service delivery in communes (on behalf of the\n            government).
