Some lessons learned included:\n            coordination with other multilaterals and bilateral\n            institutions enhances the impact of Bank operations. FSDPL I\n            was part of a package of support for the Jamaica Debt\n            Exchange (JDX) by International Financial Institutions\n            (IFIs) and bilateral donors, and its impact was amplified by\n            complementary programs by the International Monetary Fund\n            (IMF) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB). Use of\n            high level outcome indicators to measure progress can be\n            problematic. Since this was an operation that was meant to\n            enhance debt and fiscal sustainability, it made sense, a\n            priori, to include quantitative measures such as the primary\n            balance to gross domestic product (GDP) and debt to GDP. In\n            hindsight, however, it was clear that these outcomes are\n            well beyond the control of the Bank or the Government. The\n            impact of the global crisis, the Supreme Court ruling on\n            wages, and an early election on these indicators was\n            something that was difficult to counter with the measures\n            envisaged in the FSDPL series. The use of technical\n            assistance and/or investment lending to bolster capacity can\n            help achieve results on reforms. Including privatization of\n            specific enterprises as an outcome indicator is problematic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Program of Development Policy\n            Loans for Fiscal Sustainability"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Program of Development\n            Policy Loans for Fiscal Sustainability"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/09/17002174/jamaica-program-development-policy-loans-fiscal-sustainability","projn":"JM-2nd.

of the First Programmatic\n            Fiscal Sustainability Development Policy Loan (FS DPL1)\n            Program for Jamaica is to increase the efficiency of public\n            financial management and budgeting processes, by supporting\n            efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and\n            investment, and strengthen control of public finances and\n            the effectiveness of government budgeting practices. This\n            reform program is critical to the Government of Jamaica\n            (GoJ) strategy to create fiscal space for priority social\n            and investment spending and increase the growth potential of\n            Jamaica. The FS DPL1 will also support the maintenance of\n            macroeconomic stability while the GoJ adjusts to the\n            deterioration in the global environment while continuing to\n            implement the longer term reform agenda for fiscal and debt\n            sustainability. The FS DPL1 supports actions to: (a) promote\n            fiscal sustainability through control of overall public\n            sector balances and debt generation, and rationalization of\n            public bodies; (b) improve the efficiency of public\n            financial management and budget process; and (c) strengthen\n            the tax administration capacity, reduce tax distortions and\n            enhance the efficiency of the tax system. The Government has\n            made progress on these key components of its reform program,\n            even in the context of the ongoing global economic crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica -
