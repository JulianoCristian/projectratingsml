Some lessons learned included: 1) it is\n            important to ensure during project preparation that the\n            mandate of the implementing entity is consistent with the\n            scope of the project. The implementation of the two highway\n            projects in China proved unexpectedly challenging because\n            the implementing entity had no jurisdiction over the rural\n            roads and the traffic safety components; 2) some adjustments\n            in the scheduling of safeguards procedures can be\n            considered. The completion of the full resettlement action\n            plan before the preliminary engineering highway design was\n            completed wasted scarce resources as it had to be re-done\n            because the road alignments changed significantly; and 3)\n            since the gap between safeguard policies in the Bank and\n            China on highway projects is now quite small, good\n            supervision is the key to ensuring that the policies are\n            followed. In China, at least in the provinces where the\n            projects were assessed, performance-based project lending\n            has sufficed in respect of safeguards, but the application\n            of the country systems with periodic supervision by the Bank\n            can be contemplated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Tri-Provincial Highway Project, and\n            Hubei Xiaogan- Xiangfan

Some\n            lessons learned included: the project included investments\n            in three provinces with each province setting up an\n            implementing unit to implement the project in its province.\n            As it was not practical 17 organically to have a common\n            implementing agency for the project, the Bank task team had\n            to deal directly with three separate counterparts. Project\n            preparation and supervision, as a result, were more complex\n            than usual. Variances in geological conditions between those\n            actually found on site and those used in detailed designs\n            reflected a need for more comprehensive site investigations\n            at the design stage. The program for overseas training for\n            Inner Mongolia (140 person-months) turned out to be overly\n            ambitious (only 69 person-months were achieved) as the\n            province did not seem to have enough staff to be sent for\n            training. In light that the ministry of finance has become\n            stringent with the incurrence of expenses for overseas\n            training, a more realistic program may be structured for\n            future projects. Rural roads in the Roads Improvement\n            Program for Poverty Alleviation (RIPA) component have a\n            positive impact on poverty alleviation and yielded\n            considerable

operation, and maintenance of the highway\n            network; and d) increases road transport safety. There are\n            four components. The first constructs main highways,\n            expressways, and rural roads to serve the poor counties of\n            agricultural areas in three regions. This component\n            constructs civil works, electrical and mechanical works\n            including interchanges, tolling stations, service areas, and\n            management stations as well as tolling, monitoring,\n            telecommunications, and power supply and lighting systems.\n            The second component improves roads, improving all-weather\n            access to villages and towns through all-weather roads and\n            provision of non-motorized transport. The third component\n            strengthens the capacity of communications departments to\n            plan, construct, operate, and maintain the proposed highways\n            through training and the provision of critical and\n            technically appropriate equipment. The fourth component\n            funds a highway safety program, which increases cooperation\n            between the traffic police and the communication\n            departments; analyses traffic accidents; launches a pilot\n            program to treat accident black spots; develops traffic\n            safety manuals and safety audit procedures; and provides\n            equipment, technical assistance, and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
