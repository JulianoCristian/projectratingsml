The results\n            indicate first that support to SMIs resulted in more\n            middle-income jobs, although jobs in larger firms were more\n            productive. Second, Bank support for SMIs was part of a\n            broader financial sector dialogue that was fruitful. The\n            financial system became stronger and deeper and almost\n            certainly helped the economy sustain the shocks felt by its\n            neighbors. More directly, the credit risk of the commercial\n            banking sector was reduced: Also, the repayment record of\n            assisted SMIs was considerably better than that of large\n            firms. Hence, SMI lending was less risky and helped improve\n            the soundness of the banking sector. A final finding is that\n            SMI lending was an inexpensive way to support new job\n            creation. Lessons learned were four: 1) SMIs can be\n            effective job creation programs. 2) SMI lending through\n            financial intermediaries can support banking sector\n            soundness. Directed credit programs that can improve banking\n            sector soundness are possible. 3) SMIs could use more\n            flexible financial products: they confront higher real\n            borrowing costs because they have higher transaction costs.\n            4) SMIs could participate in more market-driven technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
