Some lessons\n            learned included: a project of this nature should have\n            included a user survey to be undertaken by an independent\n            entity before the investments were completed and after the\n            entry in operation of some of the investments. This will\n            allow gauging the impact of the project components on\n            different segments of the population and start building up a\n            philosophy that the users must be heard periodically in\n            Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). The nature and\n            significance of some major resettlement difficulties were\n            appreciated by the client during the process of\n            implementation. Through very active Bank involvement, Mumbai\n            Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) gradually\n            evolved its mindset for resettlement from a bureaucratic to\n            a more sustainable and consultative approach. It developed\n            capacity for managing a large scale and complex resettlement\n            process. The same was needed from other agencies such as\n            Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation Limited (MRVC) and Indian\n            Railways (IR) to change their mindset and reinforce their\n            capacity to address difficult and sensitive challenges, such\n            as the safety of trespassers and users, environmental\n            management and financial

Every component is progressing satisfactorily\n            except for the road construction component that has\n            experienced long delays and still suffers from uncertainty\n            in interagency coordination and a few remaining challenges\n            in resettlement and rehabilitation. The project includes an\n            extremely large resettlement component (18,000 households\n            and shops) that suffered difficulties resulting in an\n            Inspection Panel investigation to which the Bank's\n            management presented a remedial action plan that was\n            discussed by the Board on March 28, 2006. Since then the\n            quality of resettlement and rehabilitation under the project\n            has regularly improved to become satisfactory and the\n            resettlement is almost complete (96 percent complete as\n            February 1st, 2010) while post-resettlement activities are\n            exemplary. Out of the two major link roads that are included\n            in the project, the widening of Jogeswari-Vikhroli-Link-Road\n            is almost completed, but the creation of\n            Santacruz-Chembur-Link-Road is still encountering important\n            difficulties that leave uncertainty as to its successful\n            completion in a reasonable time. The disbursement of the\n            project amounts to 70 percent of the loan/credit amount on\n            May 31, 2010.
