The main lessons are: 1) Tunisia's\n            successful economic performance has been due to three\n            attributes: ownership and broad political consensus, a\n            well-developed human resource base, and a stable\n            macroeconomic environment. 2)  Experience in privatization\n            and the financial sector shows the need for the Bank and the\n            development partners to stay the course and show flexibility\n            in their support, provided there is evidence of genuine and\n            sustained reform efforts. For example, by accepting partial\n            reforms in some areas, and building on partial successes to\n            deepen them in subsequent operations, the support from the\n            Bank and other partners was ultimately effective. Patience,\n            perseverance and flexibility paid off. 3) An important\n            lesson for other small emerging countries seeking to lay the\n            foundations for sustainable growth and poverty reduction is\n            the success of Tunisia in creating a competitive economy by\n            the coordinated use o f macro and structural policies and reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Economic Competitiveness\n            Adjustment Loan, Second Economic Competitiveness Adjustment\n            Loan and Third Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Economic\n            Competitiveness Adjustment Loan, Second Economic\n            Competitiveness Adjustment Loan and Third Economic\n            Competitiveness Adjustment Loan Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5541621/tunisia-economic-competitiveness-adjustment-loan-second-economic-competitiveness-adjustment-loan-third-economic-competitiveness-adjustment-loan-projects","projn":"TN-Third Economic Competitiveness Adjustment\n            Loan -- P055815,TN-Ecal I -- P042287,TN-Ecal II -- P053255","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Economic Stabilization,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Achieving Shared Growth,Macroeconomic Management","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050111151717"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Non-compulsory pensions and insurance,General finance sector,Capital markets,Banking,Telecommunications,Ports, waterways and shipping,Other social services,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance,Information and communications,Transportation,Health and other social services,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Economic competitiveness; Economic\n            performance; Human resources development; Political\n            consensus; Macroeconomic stability; Structural reforms"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduct & Econ.
