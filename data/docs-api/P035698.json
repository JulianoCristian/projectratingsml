Lessons learned\n            include: more practical and realistic cost estimates should\n            be used so as to optimize the Borrower's financing\n            cost; when the sector is undergoing major changes and the\n            borrower's capacity is building up quickly, flexibility\n            should be built into the design of the technical assistance\n            (TA) component; in the face of changes in circumstances,\n            both the Bank and the Borrower should pay closer attention\n            to the relevance of the financial covenants, and seek to\n            make modifications proactively; when the environmental units\n            had the full support of management at the highest level, and\n            there was a culture of professionalism and understanding of\n            the environmental aspects, it was easy to build upon this\n            and implement the Environmental Management Program (EMP);\n            strong commitment by the various levels of government and\n            the project owner, timely dissemination of information and\n            early involvement of media and communities; comprehensive\n            resettlement policies supported by consistent and\n            transparent principles; adequate planning with regular\n            updates based on feedbacks; and effective implementation\n

These measures mitigate impacts\n            from plant, substation, and transmission line construction\n            and operation: Wastewater, drainage, and domestic sewage\n            will be treated, used in ash sluicing, and the ash water\n            reclaimed later for re-use. The ash lagoon will encroach on\n            vegetation, but not result in any significant habitat loss.\n            A drainage ditch will redirect and recirculate all ash water\n            and ash dam seepage within the power station. Ash\n            by-products will either be stored in lagoons, used in\n            construction, or dried for fly ash use. Control noise by\n            adopting silencers and sound insulation, among other\n            measures. Using a boiler with low NOx combustion technology\n            will control emissions, and studies will decide whether to\n            improve dispersion or further distance the sites from each\n            other. Maintain clearance over trees, other power lines,\n            roads, railways, etc. Suitable species will be planted to\n            replace felled trees and to revegetate. Use water sprays to\n            suppress dust emissions. Collect runoff and let it settle to\n            discharge suspended solid emissions. Collect domestic sewage\n            in septic tanks or sewers. Routing will minimize\n            relocations.
