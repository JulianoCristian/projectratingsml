Thus, it should be expected\n            that any new concept should be accompanied by the\n            appropriate technical assistance, and for all practical\n            purposes, that its full functionality be expected within a\n            continued, intense program of technical assistance, to\n            support the formative stages of reform. Finally, lessons\n            point at the fact that, even if consensus between various\n            donors, and the Government exists concerning a planned\n            policy change, this consensus may subsequently fall apart if\n            the policy stance of the donors concerned evolves; the\n            latter being triggered often by staff rotation. This problem\n            has been observed in several recent cases in Africa and\n            elsewhere, and has been particularly pointed out in the\n            Niger case. Governments can easily exploit differences of\n            opinion between donors, and are sometime caught in\n            conflicting demands by different donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Transport Infrastructure Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Transport Infrastructure Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/02/2946361/niger-transport-infrastructure-project","projn":"NE-Transp.
