Ratings for the Reform\n            Support Credit Project for Georgia were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the experience of the Judicial Reform\n            Project shows that making the judiciary more independent,\n            effective, adherent to higher ethical standards and\n            professional requires interventions that go beyond\n            rehabilitating infrastructure, using information technology,\n            and educating the public. Establishment of an independent\n            and effective judiciary requires strong political will and\n            continuous commitment of the country authorities, which a\n            Bank operation can only complement, but not substitute for.\n            The experience of SAC3 and Reform Support Credits reiterates\n            that Bank support can be effective in promoting and\n            supporting change when the authorities are ready for reform,\n            but not otherwise. When the authorities are not ready it\n            could be argued that financial support may weaken the need\n            for change and strengthen the capacity to maintain the\n            status quo The experience of the Reform Support Credit shows\n            that simpler rules reduce opportunities for corruption. When\n            the government simplified the rules and streamlined\n            administrative procedures in organizations like the traffic\n            police, customs, and tax administration their staff\n            delivered better services and extorted fewer bribes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Judicial Reform Project; Third\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project; Reform

The components of this operation emerged from\n            within the Government's overall development strategy,\n            which created ownership, and in turn recognized the extent\n            of policymakers' consensus to prod the reform agenda.\n            Moreover, participation of the civil society and the overall\n            level of public trust is an important element for\n            introducing radical reforms, and successful implementation\n            of its process. Moreover, a clear and well defined\n            assignment of responsibility within government entities\n            specified and defined the boundaries of responsibility, and\n            accountability for the implementation of various parts of\n            the reform process. This further supported the achievement\n            of program objectives, through a well coordinated effort\n            among donors, both in terms of advice and activities so as\n            to maximize synergies and improve cohesiveness. The\n            importance of Government institutional and implementation\n            capacity is emphasized, as a binding constraint for\n            successful development, and implementation of

initial assistance to the new Government of\n            Georgia, in its efforts to define, and implement a program\n            of economic, legal, and social reforms. The Project will\n            support actions in the following areas: 1) improvement in\n            governance and anti-corruption; 2) improvement in public\n            finance management; and, 3) steps to resolve crucial issues\n            in the energy sector. Actions taken in these areas will\n            significantly contribute to the implementation of broader\n            structural reforms over the medium term. At the same time,\n            the project aims to define, in broad preliminary terms, a\n            framework for future policy-based lending, and policy\n            dialogue by the International Development Association (IDA),\n            to support the country's medium-term economic growth,\n            and poverty reduction efforts. This will further support\n            fiscal stability and poverty reduction directly. First, the\n            proposed project will address issues of governance,\n            corruption, and the business environment, to facilitate new\n            businesses, and create employment. Second, a stable fiscal\n            environment should allow for the timely payment of salaries,\n            pensions, and social expenditures. It will also foster\n            Government links between the Economic Development and\n            Poverty Reduction Framework programs and the budget process.\n            Despite risks, the new political environment, the\n            overwhelming electoral victories at the Presidential and\n            Parliamentary elections, and the recent return of Adjara\n            under the authority of the Government, will help ameliorate\n            these risks, while lessons of past adjustment lending, in\n            particular the weak government implementation capacity, have\n            been carefully factored into the design: a narrow focus on\n            priority issues, and the requirement for reform implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Reform Support Credit
