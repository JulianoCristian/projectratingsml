Ratings for the Second Phase of\n            the 135 Programs Supports Credit Project was as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the One-Two Public\n            Investment Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: excessive flexibility regarding the policy\n            content of a programmatic series weakens the program.\n            Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy\n            lending, there is room for striking a better balance between\n            flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially met triggers\n            as prior actions should be considered with particular\n            caution. Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and\n            other external partners to withdraw their support for weakly\n            implemented reform programs and unproductive policy dialogue\n            can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations.\n            The delays in the second operations of P135 and PIR, and\n            PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns with program\n            quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in\n            the case of P135. Arguments for budget predictability under\n            the Paris Declaration are less relevant in Vietnam due to\n            relatively small share of budget support in public\n            expenditures. A strong knowledge base is of critical\n            importance for upstream design of reforms and parallel\n            technical assistance to support their implementation.\n            Selectivity

Vietnam were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the breadth of\n            the reform undertaking and linkages among policy actions\n            across sectors called for a comprehensive approach to\n            dialogue and support by development partners. The strong\n            track record of government commitment and adoption by\n            partners of the PRSC series to match government priorities\n            and processes made this approach work. Analytical work gives\n            insight on inter-linkages across individual policy areas, as\n            well as cross-cutting issues, and helps ensure they are\n            appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported\n            under the operation. Dedicated and adequate resources for\n            analytical work and short-term technical assistance enables\n            the government and development partners to assess the\n            potential impacts of related policy actions and help refine\n            the proposals. Donor coordination can strengthen the policy\n            dialogue and deliver benefits to the client. The PRSC series\n            served as an effective framework for policy dialogue and\n            interactions between the government and donors. Government\n            line ministries voiced concern that financial flows from the\n            PRSCs went directly into the state budget, and their\n            participation in the often time-intensive policy dialogue\n            did not result in direct budgetary increases. Multi-sectoral\n            Development Policy Lending\u0092s (DPLs) may be best suited to\n            ministries that have clear and strong policy linkages, and\n            where improved policy coordination is a primary objective.\n            There is a need to complement consideration of outcome\n            indicators by looking at qualitative assessments of\n            achievements and also at complementary objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - A Series of Five Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - A Series of

Support\n            Credit Project supports actions to restructure the state\n            sector and promote business development. It also covers\n            measures aimed at fostering social inclusion and better\n            managing natural resources. And it supports governance\n            reforms in areas such as public financial management, public\n            administration, and legal and judicial development. These\n            fundamental reforms provide the foundation upon which the\n            government can then effectively implement sectoral policy\n            actions. The potential volatility of capital inflows makes\n            it important for Vietnam to secure resources on a long-term\n            basis and to signal the support of the international\n            community to its reform program. Strong capital inflows and\n            government interventions in the exchange rate market to\n            prevent the appreciation of the dong resulted in higher\n            inflation, a current account deficit and an asset price\n            bubble in 2007. Bank lending and investments of state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs) in the stock market and in real estate\n            amplified these trends. Market sentiment might have reversed\n            Sound macroeconomic management will be critical to sustain a\n            strong economic performance and continued poverty reduction\n            in this more turbulent environment. To address this risk,\n            the current credit supports measures aimed at enhancing the\n            effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. They include the\n            assessment of SOE investments in the financial and real\n            estate sectors, the strengthening of banking supervision and\n            corporate governance in
