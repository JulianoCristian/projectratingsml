Some lessons learned included: to improve\n            predictability of resource flow, PRSC operations can be\n            designed such that the timing of the tranche release is held\n            constant while the amount is adjusted in line with borrower\n            performance. The non-approval of the PRSC-II operation\n            suggests that this instrument has not yet been able to\n            deliver on the promise of greater predictability in the\n            annual resource flow made available to Honduras. In\n            response, International Development Association (IDA) has\n            been preparing a new budget support operation that seeks to\n            keep the timing predictable, but adjusting the credit amount\n            according to the number and substance of the triggers\n            achieved within that pre-determined period. Effective donor\n            coordination during the formulation of policy conditionality\n            reduces the danger of providing conflicting policy advice.\n            Staff of the Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF),\n            Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and bilateral donors\n            consulted regularly on policy matters relating to poverty\n            reduction strategy (PRS) implementation in Honduras during\n            program preparation. Program design should be simple\n            (limiting the amount of triggers) and targets should be\n            realistic, particularly where political consensus is\n            lacking, such as during pre-election periods. In such cases,\n            it is often better to focus on consolidating existing gains\n            and avoiding policy reversals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - First Poverty Reduction Support\n

PRSC-I was prepared mainly with Bank staff\n            that also was involved in the preparation of investment\n            operations in the various sectors focused on in the PRSC\n            policy matrix.

Finally, the non-enforcement of the\n            ministerial resolution issued by the health ministry in\n            compliance with a Board presentation condition for PRSC-I\n            would be

single-tranche Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) to\n            the Republic of Honduras for SDR 40.54 million, which\n            includes an original amount of SDR 38.6 million (US$56\n            million equivalent) and a supplemental credit in the amount\n            of SDR 1.94 million (US$2.8 million equivalent).  The main\n            objective of the PRS, which analyzes the causes of poverty\n            and encompasses reforms and investment programs in a broad\n            range of sectors, is to reduce poverty by 24 percentage\n            points over the period 2001-2015. Overall, the Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the associated first\n            Progress Report (PRSP-PR), which was discussed by the Board\n            in February 2004, present a strategy to reduce poverty in\n            Honduras. The strategy itself is structured around six\n            pillars: (1) accelerating equitable and sustainable growth\n            to levels consistent with the income poverty reduction\n            targets; (2) reducing rural poverty; (3) reducing urban\n            poverty; (4) enhancing investment in human capital; 5)\n            strengthening social protection for specific vulnerable\n            groups; and (6) ensuring the sustainability of the strategy\n            through governance and institutional reforms and enhanced\n            environmental sustainability. In line with these pillars,\n            the PRSC aims to support Government's efforts to:\n            accelerate pro-poor growth, via support for reforms aimed at\n            increasing competitiveness and maximizing the potential for\n            new investment and employment-creation for men and   women\n            in both urban and rural areas in the wake of new regional\n            and international agreements, in particular, the Central\n            America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA); increase the impact\n            and efficiency of resources devoted to human development and\n            social protection, with a focus on deconcentration of\n            responsibilities for service provision and increased\n            empowerment of beneficiaries of key services; and increase\n            the medium- and long-term sustainability of poverty\n            reduction initiatives through policy and institutional\n            reforms geared to strengthening governance and public sector\n            management and improving management of the environment,\n            particularly in Honduras' extensive protected areas. In\n            addition, the PRSC will support the Government's\n            initiatives to systematize consultation processes around the\n            poverty reduction strategy and strengthen monitoring and\n            evaluation at national and community levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/05/12582626/honduras-poverty-reduction-support-credit-project","projn":"HN-Prsc -- P074758","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,Achieving Shared Growth","teratopic":"Environment,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Honduras","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100726052116"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Other social services,General public administration sector,General industry and trade sector,General education sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Poverty mitigation strategies;
