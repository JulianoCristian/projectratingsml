Some lessons learned\n            included: a regional Caribbean approach to training\n            fiduciary and management staff is recommended when qualified\n            human resources are in short supply and when training\n            fiduciary staff for each donor supported project will be\n            expensive as this issue was faced by most of the Caribbean\n            HIV and AIDS projects. It is important for small states to\n            have costed national AIDS strategic plans that allocate\n            funds appropriately and that flexibly can reallocate\n            resources if faced with unforeseen economic and financial\n            challenges. Bank assistance helped raise political\n            commitment, create or strengthen AIDS institutions, enlist\n            nongovernmental organizations, and prioritize activities.\n            Political commitment and capacity, however, need to be\n            nurtured as priorities change in countries that attract many\n            donors. Creating new services and support systems under a\n            vertical disease project should and can benefit the\n            efficiency of the organizational unit in which the project\n            is located such as the technical and fiduciary capacity\n            developed in the ministry of health (MOH) through the health\n            services development unit (HSDU) as the project

It also funds monitoring, evaluation, and research,\n            Component 2 supports the scaling up of the response to\n            HIV/ATDS by line ministries, civil society organizations,\n            and the private sector.  Component 3 expands health sector\n            prevention, treatment and care services for HIV/AIDS."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - HIV/AIDS Prevention and\n            Control Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3034922/guyana-hivaids-prevention-control-project","projn":"GY-Hiv/Aids Prevention & Control Project\n            -- P076722","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Adolescent Health,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Guyana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040312154323"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Antenatal Clinic,Behavior\n            Change,Commercial Sex,Commercial Sex\n            Workers,commodities,condoms,counselors,decision\n            making,democracy,discrimination,drugs,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,farmers,financial management,gender,health workers,HIV\n            infection,impact assessments,information\n            systems,international standards,laboratories,laboratory\n            equipment,laboratory services,Medicine,NGOs,nutritional\n            support,physicians,primary health care,Private\n            Sector,prophylaxis,public sector,quality of\n            life,safety,safety nets,sex partners,sex with men,Sex\n            Workers,sexual health,Sexually Transmitted Infections,social\n            services,social workers,STIs,syndromic\n            management,teachers,technical assistance,waste,youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,Antenatal Clinic,Behavior\n            Change,Commercial Sex,Commercial Sex\n            Workers,commodities,condoms,counselors,decision\n            making,democracy,discrimination,drugs,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,farmers,financial management,gender,health workers,HIV\n            infection,impact assessments,information\n            systems,international standards,laboratories,laboratory\n            equipment,laboratory services,Medicine,NGOs,nutritional\n            support,physicians,primary health care,Private\n            Sector,prophylaxis,public sector,quality of\n            life,safety,safety nets,sex partners,sex with men,Sex\n            Workers,sexual health,Sexually Transmitted Infections,social\n            services,social workers,STIs,syndromic\n            management,teachers,technical assistance,waste,youth"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF026629-PHRD-GUYANA: CARIBBEAN HIV/AIDS\n            PREVENTION AND CONTROL (APL),TF030571-IDA CONSULTANTS POOLED CTF - FY04","repnb":"27394"},"2982320":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/02/2982320/guyana-hivaids-prevention-control-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/02/2982320/guyana-hivaids-prevention-control-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","new_url":"2004/02/2982320/guyana-hivaids-prevention-control-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/03/03/000090341_20040303100543/Rendered/INDEX/IPP7210paper.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/03/03/000090341_20040303100543/Rendered/PDF/IPP7210paper.pdf","credit_no":"Q416","docdt":"2004-02-20T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2004-03-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Guyana - HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control\n            Project : indigenous peoples plan"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Guyana has an estimated indigenous\n            population (IP) of 8% of the total population of 800,000.\n            The Amerindians, as the IP are known, belong to 9 distinct\n            groups or tribes who make up the majority population in the\n            interior region of the country bordering Surinam, Brazil and\n            Venezuela. Most Amerindians live in about 131 highly\n            scattered communities, many of them sparsely populated. The\n            indigenous people of Guyana are disproportionately\n            disadvantaged socially and economically. The overall poor\n            state of health is reflected in low life expectancy, with\n            less than 5% of Amerindians living to be 55 years or older\n            compared to the average life expectancy for Guyana. Until\n            recently, there were no  mechanisms to ensure a coordinated\n            approach to education programs for Amerindian communities.\n            Although HIV/AIDS prevalence is still low in the interior\n            regions, the potential exists for the problem to escalate if\n            actions are not taken now to prevent the spread of the\n            disease in the indigenous populations.

undertake activities for indigenous peoples\n            through the demand driven component, and liaise with other\n            ministries especially the Ministry of Health and Education\n

Guyana; reviews and analyzes the institutional, legal, and\n            regulatory health care system framework; and finally\n            identifies problems and alternative solutions. The\n            assessment of the health facilities shows that there is an\n            adequate level of segregation, in-house handling, treatment,\n            and ultimate disposal of most biomedical wastes, although\n            there are gaps in management, equipment, incineration, and\n            treatment that pose risks to the integrity of the overall\n            system.

The situation will be improved and the risks\n            mitigated by 1) improving the legal and regulatory\n            framework, and expand the scope to include waste and\n            residues transport and site disposal; 2) codifying practices\n            to ensure that international standards apply; 3) clarifying\n            management responsibilities; 4) training staff and\n            developing their expertise in applying the new guidelines\n            and protocols, and monitoring application; and 5) upgrading\n            facilities and equipment (providing protective gear,\n
