The Bank contributed significantly\n            during project identification and preparation, and\n            particularly in the preparatory work of the project. As\n            stated earlier, the Bank made several periodic reviews of\n            project implementation. These comments and recommendations\n            have been very helpful. It was most helpful in that some of\n            the reviewing staff have been also responsible for project\n            appraisal and preparation. The project was successful in\n            improving periodic maintenance of the trunk road network\n            including bridges and in strengthening the institutions\n            concerned with transport infrastructure. Sound maintenance\n            and substantial rehabilitation were an urgent need to\n            prevent further serious deterioration. Hence, the assessment\n            of the Highway sector problems and priorities, and the\n            resultant project of road maintenance and rehabilitation,\n            has been appropriate and
