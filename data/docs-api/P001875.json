Transparent and well-publicized\n            procedures in community-driven projects serve to neutralize\n            exogenous political interference and attempts by the\n            community's elite to capture project's benefits.\n            Once an agreement has been reached on the choice of the\n            communities, eligible investments and maximum investment\n            amounts per community, the specific village investment plans\n            become binding and can only be changed by a new consensus at\n            the community level, and not by one individual. Baseline\n            data and a functional Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            matter even when direct beneficiaries openly express their\n            genuine satisfaction for the many benefits received. The\n            project did not implement a functional M&E system to\n            evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the project's\n            performance. This was further compounded by the fact that\n            the need for a baseline was overlooked during project\n            preparation. An effective centralized Project Implementation\n            Unit (PIU) does not preclude the necessity to decentralize\n            project management as much as possible, especially in a vast\n            country such as Mauritania, with a large number of scattered\n            communities. Mass media communication (TV and radio) is\n            extremely useful in informing the public about the\n            project's activities. This can be further expanded, for\n            example, through interactive radio programs, tailor-made to\n            support specific project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Rainfed
