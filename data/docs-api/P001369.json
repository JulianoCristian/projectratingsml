The project\n            partly achieved all of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was substantial, sustainability is\n            likely, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, emergency projects need to be formulated so\n            that they meet priority needs and, as with non-emergency\n            projects, local consultation and assessment is a necessary\n            part of the design process. Second, there is justification\n            for distributing free seed to impoverished farmers to assist\n            in their drought recovery. Third, rapid disbursement is\n            essential for emergency projects and standard Bank and\n            Government procedures can cause delays in delivery. Fourth,\n            the time scale required for road improvements means that\n            this type of activity can rarely be accommodated in a\n            two-year project. Fifth, mismanagement of funds, when\n            detected, needs to be dealt with swiftly and decisively.\n            Finally, drought relief in pastoral areas is likely to\n            require support for societal restocking, resource sharing,\n            and keeping selected animals alive for rebuilding herds later."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -
