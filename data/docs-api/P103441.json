Some lessons learned included:\n            the broad scope of this project, covering both the central\n            and municipal levels, created a supportive environment for\n            important advances in Chile\u0092s financial management which\n            have already started to have positive impacts in the\n            timeliness of available information. Nevertheless, given the\n            challenges often associated with FMIS projects, it is\n            important to consider and plan for the trade-offs that may\n            be necessary and their impact on full achievement of the\n            development objective.  In the case of Chile, the decision\n            to proceed gradually allowed it to initiate implementation\n            (and deal with the issues that arose) without risking\n            impacting the entirety of the government, and shift towards\n            a more aggressive strategy only when such problems had been\n            addressed. Nevertheless, this strategy has its costs \u0096\n            requiring that resources continue to be allocated to both\n            the old system and the new one, and may diminish individual\n            institution\u0092s incentives to transition to the new system. In\n            projects of this magnitude, it is important that the\n            directorate leading it have all of the necessary\n            competencies related to technology, finances, budgeting, and\n            management capacity. When all of these are not present, it\n            can cause challenges that impact quality, time and/or costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Second Public Expenditure Management
