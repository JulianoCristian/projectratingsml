Ratings for the Third Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit for Senegal are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was\n            significant, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also rated as\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            The PRSCs had a clear impact on Government ownership of the\n            reform program. The PRSCs helped the reformers within the\n            ministries to mobilize the entire Government on\n            cross-cutting issues and encouraged the Government to\n            provide leadership and accountability. Subsequently, the\n            strengthened alignment and predictability of support through\n            the PRSCs have begun to lead to improved decision making by\n            the Government at various levels. This momentum has to be\n            maintained and strengthened in two ways. One, the Bank\n            should reinforce this instrument and confirm its confidence\n            in the country-based model by gradually increasing the share\n            of the budget support in the global portfolio. Two, the Bank\n            has to take the lead in facilitating coordination among\n            donors in order to reassure those countries that hesitate to\n            move toward budget support. 2) The PRSC instrument can be an\n            efficient instrument for reinforcing the Government's\n            monitoring and evaluation system. 3) Budgetary support\n            through an instrument such as a PRSC is an effective tool to\n            address cross-cutting constraints and issues that affect\n            service delivery, notably in health and education -- that\n            cannot be effectively addressed at the sector level or\n            through investment operations only. 4) An institutional\n            anchor is important and necessary to ensure that specific\n            needs are incorporated into budgetary discussions; this is\n            particularly true for issues such as decentralization or the\n            protection of vulnerable groups that involve multiple\n            Ministries and agencies. Conversely, those areas that do not\n            have such an anchor lack an advocate in the budget process\n            and consequently may not receive adequate funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal

protecting\n            environment and managing durable resources; and (viii)\n            protection of vulnerable groups by improving their\n            productive capacity and reducing gender disparities. Within\n            these broad orientations, the PRSP has four pillars: (i)\n            wealth creation through economic reform and private sector\n            development; (ii) capacity building and development of basic\n            social services; (iii) improving living condition of\n            vulnerable groups; and (iv) implementation of the strategy\n            and monitoring of its outcomes. As noted in the joint staff\n            IMF/World Bank assessment (December 2002), the PRSP suffered\n            from some shortcomings, which the authorities intended to\n            address during the first years of strategy implementation.\n            Among them, it was found that the Government's plans to\n            implement the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) were not\n            spelled out in sufficient details, notably with regard to a\n            fiscal decentralization strategy that would assure better\n            public services. The poverty diagnostic did not benefit from\n            a complete analysis of the new household survey data, and\n            the impact of the specific measures on the well-being of the\n            poor was not analyzed in detail."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -
