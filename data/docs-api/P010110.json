The utilization of the credit\n            was slower than anticipated due mainly to the difficult\n            industrial and overall economic environment in Nepal. The\n            major problems encountered included the long delay and\n            inadequate management of project implementations. On hind\n            sight, this was due to the escalating interest and\n            inadequate financial commitment of project sponsors who\n            lacked experience in industry. In comparison to other\n            development financing institution, the Nepal Industrial\n            Development Corporation (NIDC) has relied heavily on equity\n            financing from government and/or government-owned\n            institutions. NIDC is a stronger institution with suitable\n            policies, more streamlined organization and procedures,\n            higher standards, and improved staffing policies and\n            training.
