Key lessons focus on the\n            following areas: 1) institutionally, incremental efforts to\n            strengthen the planning, and implementation capacity of the\n            Ministry of Health (MOH), and of the Project Implementation\n            Unit (PIU), produced good results, namely in the MOH's\n            ability to design, and implement similar programs in the\n            future, with minimal external assistance. However, the PIU\n            should have played a facilitator's role for MOH\n            programs, rather than an implementing authority, and, the\n            Department of Health Services' key role in design,\n            should have been taken into account, possibly as\n            implementing agency, to mainstream with stakeholders, and\n            coordinate implementation during the design phase; 2)\n            technical, and social aspects, addressing the issue of staff\n            security in isolated locations of certain health facilities,\n            facilities which may well remain underused, or even unused,\n            hampering service delivery. Moreover, the inadequacy of\n            community consultations since the early planning stage,\n            hindered ownership, and support, be it for the quality of\n            construction, quality of care, or maintenance of health\n            facilities; and, 3) operational issues, stipulating that\n            while poor donor coordination, precluded the much-needed\n            refresher training for maternal, and child health workers,\n            responsiveness, teamwork, and flexibility led to outputs,\n            which in several cases, exceeded expectations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Population and Family Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Population and Family\n            Health Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1551939/nepal-population-family-health-project","projn":"NP-Population & Health -- P010460","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01072804053881"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"clinics,contraceptives,decision\n            making,districts,doctors,equipment,essential drugs,Family\n            Planning,financial management,health centers,health\n            facilities,health interventions,health policy,health\n            posts,health programs,health sector,Health Services,Health\n            Training,high fertility,Infant Mortality,Infant Mortality\n            Rate,life expectancy,managers,medical equipment,medical\n            supplies,mobility,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,Nutrition,outreach\n            work,partnership,Poverty Reduction,pregnant women,Primary\n            Health Care,public health,rural\n            areas,supervision,Sustainability,Village Development,Wood,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"clinics,contraceptives,decision\n            making,districts,doctors,equipment,essential drugs,Family\n            Planning,financial management,health centers,health\n            facilities,health interventions,health policy,health\n            posts,health programs,health sector,Health Services,Health\n            Training,high fertility,Infant Mortality,Infant Mortality\n            Rate,life expectancy,managers,medical equipment,medical\n            supplies,mobility,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,Nutrition,outreach\n            work,partnership,Poverty Reduction,pregnant women,Primary\n            Health Care,public health,rural\n            areas,supervision,Sustainability,Village Development,Wood,workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
