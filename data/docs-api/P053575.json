The Indigenous\n            Profiles systematically identify the areas populated by\n            indigenous peoples and African descendent communities,\n            particularly their expectations regarding health. During the\n            last few years, the government had undertaken three\n            important initiatives in which indigenous peoples were\n            consulted on health issues. The main health problems they\n            considered priority are: respiratory infections, parasitic\n            infections, and HIV/AIDS. Considered less common are mental\n            disorders, occupational accidents, malaria, and dengue.\n            Also, there are elevated rates of child malnutrition,\n            although not fully accounted by the African descendants in\n            the country's Caribbean region. Child mortality and\n            maternal mortality are also high and associated with low\n            sexual and reproductive health and limited access to health\n            services. Institutional weaknesses and low quality of\n            service were also problems. Finally, environmental\n            degradation, and land and water contamination lead to high\n            levels of diarrhea and a high incidence of dehydrated\n            children and to death. An integral part of the strategy for\n            local participation will include periodic participatory\n            assessments of benefits reaching indigenous African\n            descendent communities and subprojects supporting\n            subcontracting with local nongovernmental organizations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Health System Reform Project :\n            indigenous
