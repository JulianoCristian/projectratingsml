The Bank played a positive role in the preparation\n            of the project. An important lesson to be learned from the\n            project is the need for an adequate advance study of the\n            priorities in the sector prior to appraising a project. This\n            is evident from the major improvements made in the project\n            composition at appraisal as compared to project preparation.\n            The development of a well-balanced project at appraisal was\n            possible because of additional data and information made\n            available after the project preparation mission. The project\n            included construction of axle-load control stations and the\n            Loan Agreement provided a covenant requiring enforcement of\n            axle-load control. Here, it is important to note that the\n            weigh stations were completed on time and axle-load control\n            was fully enforced, which is a rare event in developing\n            countries. An assessment of Botswana's success in\n            enforcement of axle-loads would no doubt provide valuable\n            experience for the Bank in assisting other countries to\n            succeed in their effort to enforce axle-load control."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana -
