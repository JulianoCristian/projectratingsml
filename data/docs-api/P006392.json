Some of the lessons learned from the\n            project are: 1) livestock and plant disease control programs\n            should be linked to a government strategy which specifies\n            the policy position for the agricultural sector including\n            the livestock and plant subsectors, and its links to export\n            growth, and shows concrete evidence of being carried out; 2)\n            state level producer associations and municipalities have\n            tremendous potential to participate with government in\n            animal and plant disease control/eradication programs but\n            this needs simpler, more practical mechanisms which avoid\n            legal and operational difficulties; 3) Project\n            organizational structure and lines of responsibility must be\n            simple, clear and rational, heeding political realities and\n            the incentives system affecting the performance of public\n            and other agencies. Project coordinating units should stress\n            decentralized operations, simplified processes and lean\n            staffing; and 4) a project operating manual, with\n            comprehensive rules and norms for project operation, and\n            flexible enough to permit project modification, can be an\n            important factor in spreading the idea and initiating the\n

resulting from disease.  In order to\n            achieve this objective, the project aims to assist the\n            Ministry of Agriculture in transforming the existing federal\n            and state veterinary departments into modern, cost-effective\n            services.  To this end, the Livestock Disease Control\n            Project is the first Bank-financed project in Brazil to be\n            directly implemented by the Ministry of agriculture.  It\n            intends to (a) strengthen the Federal Government's\n            Department of Animal Health Protection through recruitment\n            and training of staff, management training, employment of\n            consultant services and purchase of field equipment; (b)\n            strengthen 15 state veterinary services through training and\n            the purchase of equipment; and (c) increase and improve the\n            quality of staff at nine federal laboratories belonging to\n            the Department of Animal Disease Laboratories through staff\n            recruitment, training and the use of consultant services.\n            Further to this, the project seeks to (d) improve the\n            physical facilities at the nine federal laboratories, one\n            state laboratory in Rio Grande do Sul, the Panamerican\n            Center for Foot-and-Mouth Disease outside Rio and four\n            quarantine stations.
