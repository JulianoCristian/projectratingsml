Ratings for the\n            System Efficiency Improvement, Equitization, and Renewables\n            Project for Vietnam were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in supporting the sector to move towards\n            long-term financial viability and fiscal sustainability, the\n            Bank should lay primary emphasis on broader institutional\n            and policy measures for cost recovery. In contrast, specific\n            target-oriented and time-bound measures in the form of\n            tariff or financial performance covenants carry excessive\n            political implementation risks and are prone to\n            noncompliance by the Borrower. A national push for universal\n            electricity access provision will primarily depend upon the\n            pursuit of a least cost path for grid expansion backed by\n            appropriate sector policies, complemented by off-grid\n            electricity in the interim, or for the long-term as needed.\n            Rapid growth in electrification can be accompanied by\n            sub-optimal use of electricity especially in a situation of\n            relatively low or subsidized tariffs. The Bank should work\n            to develop an understanding with client countries over the\n            role of key institutions before embarking on full-fledged\n            support for them. In a rapidly evolving sector environment,\n            a de facto flexible approach should be adopted to adjust to\n            changing priorities as well as new institutional and\n            on-the-ground developments. The project monitoring and\n            evaluation (M and E) framework should focus on identifying\n            the direct causal links between project interventions and\n            outcomes to the maximum extent possible. This is\n            particularly important, albeit challenging, in large and\n            rapidly evolving sector context in which Bank-supported\n            interventions only partially influence but do not determine\n            overall outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Transmission, Distribution, and\n            Disaster Reconstruction Project; Rural Energy Project; and\n

Some lessons\n            learned included: the project took a big risk by including a\n            wide ranging institutional development component, and in\n            many ways provided Government of Vietnam (GOV) with the\n            analytical support to undertake the broader set of reforms\n            in the sector, many of which are now being supported through\n            other Bank-funded investment and policy loans. This\n            experience showed that significant institutional development\n            and capacity building are possible to achieve through an\n            investment operation. If the project design involves many\n            predetermined activities of a wide raging energy sector\n            issues and many implementing agencies, there is a high risk\n            that the predetermined activities need to be modified to\n            adjust to the changing needs and circumstances, which can\n            result in implementation delays and project closing date\n            extension. There is a need for a follow up training to\n            implementing agencies to strengthen their capacity to\n            conduct sound economic and financial analyses of\n            transmission and distribution investments. Technical\n            Assistance (TA) is recommended to explore better ways to\n            measure project's performance and results. A more\n            realistic assessment of using lower level of administration\n            (community, commune or district) of power supply operations\n            should be made. District or commune based joint stock\n            distribution companies and community based off-grid micro\n            hydropower plant operations proved to have limited\n            operational
