The two major sustainability\n            related milestones agreed upon were not achieved. The\n            institutional and financial sustainability of the social\n            fund (SFD) is also at stake given the recent developments of\n            restricting the SFD's autonomy and the lack of\n            Government financial contribution to SFD. The overall\n            performance of the Association was satisfactory, while\n            overall Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory. Among\n            the lessons learned were these: For better and wider impact,\n            the SFD should also aim at promoting policy changes with\n            partner institutions to reform their programs and approaches\n            to service delivery and community participation. Communities\n            should be involved early on in the project cycle. The SFD\n            should enhance its baseline monitorable indicators\n            collection and impact assessments. Government commitment and\n            contributions to various progress milestones is needed in\n            the Egyptian context to ensure that ad hoc decisions are\n            avoided which would force the SFD to operate outside its\n            mandate that are unfunded. The Government needs to focus on\n            strengthening executing ministries as well as addressing\n            issues of governance on a broader scale. It was difficult to\n            achieve institutional capacity building due to the erosion\n            of institutional autonomy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Second Social Fund
