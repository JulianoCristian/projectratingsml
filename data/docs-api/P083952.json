Fourth Roads Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Fourth Roads Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Project for Nicaragua received a highly\n            satisfactory outcome with moderate risk to development\n            outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower received\n            satisfactory ratings for their performances. The project\n            underwent eight restructurings and received additional\n            financing (AF). The first restructuring reflect the use of\n            Force Account as an additional procurement method for the\n            implementation of civil works under the project. Increase in\n            construction costs in Nicaragua led to the second\n            restructuring due to high costs the funds available under\n            component 2 could only finance 198 km of rural roads\n            stabilization with adoquines instead of 320 km originally\n            planned. Thus, the intermediate indicator target for km of\n            rural roads stabilized under the Rural Transport Improvement\n            component 2 was reduced from 320 to 198 km. The project was\n            restructured a third time due to the increase in\n            construction costs due to world wide price escalation. The\n            project results framework was revised and the closing date\n            was extended to December 31, 2012. The project closing date\n            was further extended two more times: (i) due to the delays\n            in the procurement of contractor for the road construction\n            works on the Nueva Guinea Naciones Unidas section financed\n            under the AF. Other restructuring included reallocation of\n            proceeds among various categories to allow efficient\n            completion of the project activities. The last restructuring\n            canceled the undisbursed balance due to lack sufficient time\n            to receive any procured goods before project closing date\n            and given that the project achieved its PDO and all results\n            targets. There were several lessons learned from this\n            project including the following: (1) the long term track\n            record of the Bank\u0092s engagement and coordinated efforts in\n            the country\u0092s road sub-sector provides robust platform for\n            well performing performance of projects, (2) a functional\n            Road Maintenance Fund is a key pillar for long-term\n            sustainability of the road sector, (3) application of the\n            innovative adoquines and Modulos Comunitarios de Adoquinado\n            (MCA) model is highly appropriate for rural road\n            improvements with emphasis on the poor regions, (4) projects\n            that promote women\u0092s participation generate important\n            benefits to the recipient population, (5) to encourage\n            impact evaluations in transport projects, significant\n            support and assistance should be incorporated in the project\n            design, (6) the use of MCAs is a technically feasible method\n            that also provides a number of employment and skills\n            building benefits, and (7) Creation of rural road\n            maintenance microenterprises based on trained staff of MCAs\n            can help ensure sustainability of the model after the construction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua -
