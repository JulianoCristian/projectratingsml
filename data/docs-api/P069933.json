Lessons learned included: well\n            implemented Targeted Interventions (TIs) are the key to\n            success; therefore, having Non-Government Organizations\n            (NGOs) in place early on, with a strong NGO capacity\n            building program in place, is essential. The project\n            preparation phase, with the prospect of incoming funds,\n            should be leveraged to convince political and bureaucratic\n            stakeholders of the urgency of taking such crucial actions.\n            Piecemeal extensions and interrupted funding are disruptive\n            to project implementation; particularly in TIs among high\n            risk groups. At the field level, NGOs lose credibility with\n            the community they are serving; and when the objective is\n            long term behavior change, sudden interruptions in\n            programming can cause irreparable harm. The Bank's own\n            business model of investment support with defined\n            effectiveness and closing dates is largely to blame for this\n            situation, as it is not well adapted to an ongoing program\n            with a life span which is far longer than the World\n            Bank-financed project's. The relationship between the\n            IDA and government teams is an important one, and one that\n            is built on mutual trust and understanding. Using a\n            problem-solving, partnership approach allows even tough\n            decisions to be taken and subsequently successfully\n            implemented. Making ad hoc changes in supervisory staff, or\n            an adversarial attitude on the part of the supervision team,\n            can break down the channels of communication between the\n            Bank and government and further impede implementation\n            progress. In low prevalence countries such as Bangladesh,\n            political urgency to respond proactively to a  HIV/AIDS\n            epidemic could be low. It is crucial that political\n            commitment is demonstrated at the highest level, and a\n            network of champions developed within the system, to ensure\n            that the institutional arrangements put in place have the\n            necessary ownership, technical skill and managerial autonomy\n            to successfully implement the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - HIV/AIDS Prevention Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - HIV/AIDS Prevention Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/06/9718280/bangladesh-hivaids-prevention-project","projn":"BD-Hiv/Aids Prevention Project -- P069933","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,HIV AIDS,Housing & Human Habitats,Disease Control & Prevention,Population Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20080730013730"},"theme":"Gender,Population and reproductive health,Participation and civic engagement,HIV/AIDS","subsc":"Central government administration,Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, AIDS\n            Committee, at risk groups, awareness raising, behavior\n            change, behavioral changes, behavioral surveillance,\n            behavioural change, Behavioural Indicators, blood donations,\n            blood safety, blood screening, blood supply, Blood\n            Transfusion, capacity building, circumcision, cities, civil\n            society organizations, commercial sex, commercial sex work,\n            commercial sex workers, communities, community awareness,\n            community groups, condom, condom distribution, condom\n            promotion, condom use, condoms, consistent condom use,\n            correct use of condoms, cost effectiveness, dangers,\n            detoxification, Development Goals, Development Objectives,\n            discrimination, Disease, Disease Control, Disease Research,\n            Dissemination, districts, Drug Use, Drug User, drug users,\n            drugs, effective use, epidemic, Epidemiology, Family Health,\n            Family Health International, Family Welfare, Female, female\n            sex workers, Gender, government capacity, Harm Reduction,\n            health education, Health Services, hepatitis, hepatitis B,\n            high risk groups, high-risk groups, HIV, HIV infected\n            people, HIV infection, HIV prevention, HIV prevention\n            interventions, HIV-AIDS, Hospital, Hotel, hotels, Human\n            Development, Immune Deficiency, important policy, Indigenous\n            Populations, injecting drug users, institutional capacity,\n            Intervention, lack of capacity, low prevalence, Malaria,\n            male circumcision, Male Sex, Male Sex Workers, married\n            women, medical staff, medicines, Ministry of Health,\n            National AIDS, national efforts, National level, National\n            Policy, needle exchange, needle exchange programs, Needle\n            sharing, needles, Nutrition, outreach workers, peer\n            education, Peer Educators, Personal communication,\n            Pharmaceuticals, pharmacies, policy decisions, political\n            unrest, Population Sector, prevalence rates, prevention\n            activities, prevention efforts, Progress, public awareness,\n            public health, quality assurance, quality of services,\n            referral services, religious reasons, reproductive age,\n            reproductive health, research institutions, risk behaviors,\n            risk factors, risk groups, risk populations, Risk status,\n            safe behavior, Safe Blood, Safe Blood Transfusion, safe sex,\n            screening, self help, Self-Help, service delivery, sex\n            industry, Sex with Men, Sex Worker, Sex Workers, Sexually\n            Transmitted Disease, shops, smokers, Social Development,\n            STD, STDs, street workers, supply of condoms, surveillance\n            data, syphilis, syringes, TB, Technical Assistance,\n            technical capacity, training session, transmission,\n            transportation, treatment, Tuberculosis, UNAIDS, UNFPA,\n            United Nations Population Fund, urban centres, use of\n            condoms, viral hepatitis, Virus, vision, vulnerability,\n            vulnerable groups, waste, World Health Organization"}},"owner":"S.A.
