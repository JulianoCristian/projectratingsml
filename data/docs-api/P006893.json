Lessons that\n            contributed positively to the success of this technical\n            assistance (TA) operation, highlight the importance for\n            basic legislation regarding sector reform, to be in place\n            prior to project effectiveness, to strengthen institutions,\n            and in turn, allow the project to become an essential tool\n            for the sector development objectives. Moreover, the TA\n            adapted itself to supporting expenses, which would not have\n            been available through conventional financing, and was\n            responsive in providing resources, e.g., training\n            assistance.

This report\n            analyzes Colombia's proposal for reforming its\n            regulatory regime in environmental licensing against the\n            backdrop of laws on environmental assessment existing in\n            countries with comparable experiences. The proposed changes\n            to Colombia's laws modify existing law by establishing\n            1) an instrument of environmental policy corresponding to\n            the environmental impact evaluation; 2) actions triggering\n            environmental impact studies; 3) mechanisms to determine the\n            reach/range of these studies and evaluation criteria as well\n            as to identify their significance; and 4) mechanisms for\n            public participation in government decisionmaking about\n            investment projects. It also contains six sections\n            presenting recommendations to strengthen national\n            environmental policy, the program for environmental\n            licensing, and the incorporation of environmental\n            considerations in planning, operating, and maintaining\n            infrastructure projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Energy Sector Technical\n            Assistance Project - sectoral environmental assesment guidelines"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Energy Sector\n            Technical Assistance Project - sectoral environmental\n            assesment guidelines (Vol. 2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/08/441872/colombia-energy-sector-technical-assistance-project-sectoral-environmental-assesment-guidelines-vol-2","projn":"CO-Energy Technical Assistance Project -- P006893","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Colombia","authors":{"authr":"Moncayo C, Victor Manuel"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980429111438"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Power,Oil and gas,Central government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Administrative discretion; Capacity\n            building; Community participation; Consultants; Demand\n            management; Denationalization; Electric utilities; Energy;\n            Energy demand; Energy policy; Energy utilization;\n            Environmental impact analysis; Environmental impact\n            assessment; Environmental management & planning;\n            Environmental monitoring techniques; Environmental policy;\n            Environmental regulations; Generators; Legal framework;\n            Legal reform; Licences; National policy; Natural gas;\n            Natural resource management; Nongovernmental organizations;\n            Power plants; Pricing; Private investments; Regulatory\n            agency; Regulatory infrastructure; Regulatory reform;\n            Technical assistance"}},"owner":"Energy (LCSEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF022917-PHRD-PRIVATE SECTOR ENERGY DEV.
