The lessons\n            learned indicate that the overseas training support should\n            have followed the strategic assessment as specified in the\n            Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The Institutional\n            Development Plan (IDP) was developed by a small team of\n            consultants without forming a joint State Audit Board\n            BPK/consultants task force. The Project needed components\n            that supported reform efforts in key external agencies.

The project will: 1) support BEPEKA's\n            efforts to remove existing audit scope limitations and other\n            regulatory constraints and carry out full-fledged financial\n            and performance audits; 2) promote user demand for such\n            audits; 3) reduce internal supply constraints by upgrading\n            technical and managerial skills; 4) build up the audit\n            management information system; and 5) institutionalize\n            international best practices.  The project consists of two\n            major components.  The first one is strategic planning.  An\n            international expert will be retained to (i) analyze\n            sectoral and institutional issues; (ii) review existing and\n            pending legal framework; (iii) increase demand for\n            performance auditing; (iv) plan and conduct the first set of\n            performance audits; and (v) assess other internal\n            institutional factors critical to BEPEKA's long term\n            sustainability.
