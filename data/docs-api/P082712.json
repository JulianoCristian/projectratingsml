Successful economic and\n            social development in Latin America and the Caribbean hinges\n            on the availability of reliable and affordable energy\n            supplies. Development of domestic energy resources was\n            deemed critical in oil-importing countries, notably\n            renewable resources, such as hydro, wind and solar power. In\n            Mexico, International Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development (IBRD) combined development policy lending,\n            investment lending and in-depth analytic work to help\n            develop the country\u2019s substantial renewable energy\n            potential. IBRD was helping to provide new electricity\n            access to an estimated 500,000 rural people by the end of\n            2011. Two studies on lower-carbon development in Brazil and\n            Mexico raised awareness using highly participative\n            approaches involving multiple high-level consultations with\n            ministries and public agencies. Mexico Efficient Lighting\n            and Appliances Project enhanced the country\u2019s energy\n            security by increasing efficient use of energy and\n            supporting its efforts to mitigate climate change.\n            Electrobras Distribution Rehabilitation Project improved the\n            financial and operational performance and the commercial\n            management of six Eletrobr\u00e1s-managed Distribution Companies\n            in Brazil by reducing electricity losses, increasing bill\n            collection rate, and increasing quality of service.
