A range of lessons address both positive and\n            negative aspects. While the establishment of successful tree\n            crop nurseries, and perennial inter-crops, proved\n            appropriate and resilient technical models, favorable to the\n            environment, instances of faulty site selection with respect\n            to soils and climate, and inappropriate selection of\n            varieties or clones have occurred, aggravated by the failure\n            to ensure timely provision of planting material, or vital\n            agro-inputs. Regarding institutional aspects, effective\n            project management ensured the quality of physical\n            achievements, and the development of cohesive farmers'\n            groups, but, following completion of the project, the\n            utilization of a number of local staff, and extension\n            workers is questioned, since remuneration lies on\n            Government's will. Although financing, and cost\n            recovery showed positive aspects given the accessibility to\n            credit by small-holders, credit collection has become\n            counter-productive, and, arbitrary cut-off points induce\n            credit evasion. Further lessons address land titling, and\n            extension/training aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Tree Crops Smallholder\n            Development
