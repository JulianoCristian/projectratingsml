The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Implementation of project across ministries is difficult\n            especially when the lines of authority, support\n            arrangements, and expectations of interaction between\n            ministries are not clearly defined. 2) Components that are\n            not consistent with the core purpose of a project should not\n            be added. 3) When the ability of one component to achieve\n            its objectives is dependent on the success of another, the\n            relationship between the components must be considered at\n            appraisal and throughout implementation. 4) Decisions to\n            extend projects should be made sufficiently in advance to\n            allow for continuity of activities and maximum utility of\n            the extension. 5) Key stakeholders should be involved from\n            project identification. 6) Clear performance indicators\n            should be agreed upon at appraisal. 7) Procurement capacity\n            should be thoroughly assessed at appraisal, and provisions\n            made at that time to address any inadequacies in capacity.\n            8) The experience of this project clearly illustrates the\n            relationship between intensified supervision and\n            implementation progress. 9) A further rationalization of the\n            Government's portfolio of projects is required, as\n            evidenced by the implementation delays caused by the\n            unavailability of the required Government counterpart\n            funding. In addition, strengthened financial management and\n            the introduction of accountability measures are necessary to\n            avoid delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Health Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya -
