Some lessons\n            learned includes: consultations with a wide range of experts\n            and stakeholders are important in developing and\n            successfully launching an innovative development instrument.\n            In the case of Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility\n            (CCRIF), consultations were essential to building\n            understanding of the proposed facility, the risk modeling\n            that would underpin its products, the nature of parametric\n            insurance, etc. They also served to assure the Caribbean\n            Community and Common Market (CARICOM) Heads that the Bank\n            was being responsive to their request. Without this effort\n            at consultations, it is doubtful that CCRIF's\n            membership would have reached 16 at the outset. Donor\n            support can be essential for an innovative and untested\n            development instrument. The generous donor support for CCRIF\n            to reimburse it for initial operating expenditures and pay\n            claims within its risk retention greatly reduced the risks\n            to its achieving financial sustainability. The private\n            sector expertise and hands-on knowledge of relevant markets\n            is vital to the success of a project that seeks to respond\n            to a market failure. In the case of CCRIF, the Executive\n            Chairman and the two Board members appointed just prior to\n            the facility's launch had private sector experience in\n            banking, asset management, indemnity insurance, catastrophe\n            insurance, and reinsurance in the Caribbean as well as\n            elsewhere. Their experience was a key component in decisions\n            regarding matters such selection of service providers,\n            policy conditions, pricing, and client relations. When\n            public funds e.g., capital contributions from donors and\n            beneficiary governments, both ultimately provided by\n            taxpayers support an independently and commercially managed\n            entity, it is important that those managing the entity have\n            experience with stewardship of public resources. In\n            CCRIF's case, the two Directors who were appointed soon\n            after the Facility's launch had experience in senior\n            positions in government and multilateral institutions, along\n            with their expertise in finance, insurance, and banking.\n            On-going communications with clients and other stakeholders\n            are essential in piloting successfully an innovative\n            development solution. To this end, specialized professional\n            expertise in developing and carrying out multi-media\n            communications strategies is required. In a highly\n            innovative project, it is important for Bank supervision to\n            give the implementing agency scope for creativity and\n            flexibility, while still ensuring compliance with Bank\n            operational policies. When the project implementation is in\n            the hands of experienced and highly professional staff, too\n            heavy a hand can result in poor use of available expertise,\n            stifled creativity, and missed opportunities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Caribbean - Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Caribbean - Catastrophe Risk\n
