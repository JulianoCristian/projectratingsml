The extension of the closing\n            date will also support progress toward meeting the\n            Heavily-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) completion point\n            related to textbooks, namely that '90 percent of the\n            students enrolled in all public primary schools have\n            received three textbooks covering French, mathematics, and\n            civic education, during at least the school year immediately\n            preceding the completion point'. The government had\n            purchased textbooks covering French, mathematics and civic\n            education which it intends to distribute for free to\n            students enrolled in public primary schools. This will be\n            the fifth and final extension and will result in a\n            cumulative extension of nine years and eight months from the\n            project's original closing date, requiring Regional\n            Vice President Approval."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Education\n            and Training Support Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/16264338/cote-divoire-education-training-support-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"CI-Education & Training Support -- P035655","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access & Equity in Basic Education,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Education For All","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120511011207"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration,Secondary education,Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to education, basic education,\n            classrooms, completion rates, education reform, education\n            services, improving access, learning, learning outcomes,\n            primary education, primary school, primary school children,\n            primary schools, quality of instruction, secondary\n            education, teaching"}},"owner":"Education - East/Southern (AFTEE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF033825-COTE D'IVOIRE - EDUCATION","repnb":"63644"},"13836586":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/02/13836586/cote-divoire-education-p035655-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-23","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/02/13836586/cote-divoire-education-p035655-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-23","new_url":"2011/02/13836586/cote-divoire-education-p035655-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-23","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-02-27T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-02-27T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b080a6f864","chronical_docm_id":"090224b080a6f864","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2011/02/27/3F97856A3FBF33148525784500055304/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P0356550ISR0Di022720111298854689195.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2011/02/27/3F97856A3FBF33148525784500055304/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0356550ISR0Di022720111298854689195.pdf","credit_no":"IDAP9890;IDA30790","datestored":"2011-02-27T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-02-27T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Education  : P035655 -\n            Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 23"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Education  :\n            P035655 - Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 23"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/02/13836586/cote-divoire-education-p035655-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-23","projn":"CI-Education & Training Support -- P035655","docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report","count":"Cote d'Ivoire","authors":{"authr":"Kamil,Hamoud Abdel Wedoud"},"entityids":{"entityid":"0000A8056_2011022719581086"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-natl govt admin,Tertiary education,Secondary education,Primary education","theme":"Decentralization,Rural services and infrastructure,Education for all,Gender,Participation and civic engagement","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"Education - West/Central (AFTEW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF033825-COTE D'IVOIRE - EDUCATION,TF023976-FAC CONSULTANT TRUST FUND (USD A/C),TF033870-COTE D'IVOIRE - EDUCATION,TF034803-AFRICA REGION - LABOR MARKETS ANALYSIS,TF034431-COTE D'IVOIRE - BASIC\n            EDUCATION SECTOR PROJECT","majtheme":"Public sector governance,Rural development,Human development,Social dev/gender/inclusion"},"facets":{}}}
