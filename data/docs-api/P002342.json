Lessons drawn from the\n            project, focus mainly on the achievements of the sector\n            programs, their benefits, strengths and weaknesses.\n            Experience points at the high cost, and time consuming\n            preparation of sector programs, whose full attention is\n            basically on policy reform. Taking this into account, and\n            while policy dialogue may be strong during program\n            preparation, the implementation of the investment component\n            following the program is obviously the driving force, which,\n            once the program is established, key policy dialogues tend\n            to fade away, weakening donor coordination, to resume,\n            probably, for the preparation of a follow-up program, if\n            any. Thus, the strong continuity in policy dialogue would be\n            instrumental in pursuing sector efficiency, performance, and\n            reforms, if supported by government ownership, and local\n            capacity building. Additionally, the preparation of\n            investment programs within transport sector programs, should\n            be integrated within the process of preparing annual public\n            expenditure programs, to ensure appropriate revisions later\n            on, and, the program scope, and objectives should be also\n            reviewed annually, to reflect the realistic financial availability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Transport Sector Adjustment /\n            Investment Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Transport Sector\n            Adjustment / Investment Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/06/729104/senegal-transport-sector-adjustment-investment-program-project","projn":"SN-Transport Sec.
