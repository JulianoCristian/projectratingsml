Both\n            projects were rated unsatisfactory. The Bank played an\n            important supporting role in the fulfillment of the project.\n            The objectives and approach proposed by the Bank were\n            generally sound. Bank supervision, and technical support\n            increased the transparency of the privatization process, and\n            certain project financed investments may have made the\n            estates more attractive to private investors. A\n            comprehensive strategy, organized around a logical\n            framework, is required in order to: i) generate sustainable\n            growth, and ii) improve the welfare of those who earn a\n            living from the tree crops sector. These ultimate objectives\n            can only be achieved by galvanizing the sector via improved\n            technology and increased factor productivity, and by\n            competing more effectively in international markets. Success\n            with regard to these intermediate objectives in turn\n            requires a significant injection of capital, investment in\n            human resources (\"putting people

The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, institutional development targets\n            were only partly met, sustainability is likely, and both the\n            Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, as businesses, tree\n            crop plantations should be managed by independent,\n            autonomous private sector agents who have either full\n            ownership rights or long-term leases. Second, the policy,\n            institutional, and regulatory environment governing the tree\n            crops sub-sector should be as free as possible of export\n            taxes, political interference, restrictive labor policies,\n            practices, and marketing regulations. Third, there is a need\n            to ensure a firm commitment by donors to finance specific\n            components and establish appropriate implementation and\n            monitoring procedures. Fourth, investment in social welfare\n            development is valuable even in the context of a\n            commercially based program. Lastly, Sri Lanka needs to\n            ensure that research programs reflect the existing knowledge\n            base and adequately address the evolving commercial\n            requirements of the international industry and do not remain\n            confined to investigations of academic or insular interest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Fourth Tree Crops Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Fourth Tree Crops Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/734528/sri-lanka-fourth-tree-crops-project","projn":"LK-Tree Crops IV -- P010213","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925213801"},"subsc":"(Historic)Perennial crops","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting policies,accounting\n            services,ADB,Agriculture,audit reports,auditing,Bank\n            Loans,Bank Performance,Central Bank,centrally planned\n            economy,coconut,Coconut\n            Research,coconuts,commodity,commodity price\n            projections,comparative advantage,copra,crop,crop\n            development,crop processing,crop production,crop\n            research,debt,drainage,economic criteria,Economic\n            Impact,economic policies,Economic Rate of\n            Return,effluents,employment,environmental\n            protection,equipment,Exchange rate,expenditures,export\n            growth,field work,financial crisis,financial\n            management,fiscal policy,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fuelwood,GDP,housing,innovation,Institutional\n            Development,labor costs,labor force,latex,"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting policies,accounting\n            services,ADB,Agriculture,audit reports,auditing,Bank\n            Loans,Bank Performance,Central Bank,centrally planned\n            economy,coconut,Coconut\n            Research,coconuts,commodity,commodity price\n            projections,comparative advantage,copra,crop,crop\n            development,crop processing,crop production,crop\n            research,debt,drainage,economic criteria,Economic\n            Impact,economic policies,Economic Rate of\n            Return,effluents,employment,environmental\n            protection,equipment,Exchange rate,expenditures,export\n            growth,field work,financial crisis,financial\n            management,fiscal policy,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fuelwood,GDP,housing,innovation,Institutional\n            Development,labor costs,labor force,latex,"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"12045"},"740115":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/03/740115/sri-lanka-fourth-tree-crops-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/03/740115/sri-lanka-fourth-tree-crops-project","new_url":"1985/03/740115/sri-lanka-fourth-tree-crops-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/03/01/000009265_3970702135844/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/03/01/000009265_3970702135844/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1562","docdt":"1985-03-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-03-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Fourth Tree Crops Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project aims at increasing the\n            production of tea, rubber, and coconuts by improving the\n            productivity of all publicly-held estates, rehabilitating\n            factories, providing field and nursery equipment, and\n            improving transportation.
