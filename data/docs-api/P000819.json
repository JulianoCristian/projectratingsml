The EDP had four principal objectives: (i)\n            enhance the role of the private sector in the economy\n            thereby generating employment and nurturing the development\n            of Gambian entrepreneurs; (ii) improve the performance of\n            the largest bank, the Gambia Commercial and development Bank\n            (GCDB), and increase the participation of financial\n            intermediaries in the financing of private enterprises;\n            (iii) continue the PE reform program; and (iv) develop the\n            capacity of banks and Small and Medium-size Enterprises\n            (SME) support institutions to prepare, appraise, and\n            supervise SME projects, and provide extension services to\n            SMEs. Bank performance in project preparation and appraisal\n            was unsatisfactory.
