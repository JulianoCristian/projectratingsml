stabilization program, and measures initiated and being\n            implemented since then in areas critical to restoring\n            economic viability. These policies provided the basis for\n            the Structural Adjustment Loan I (Loan No, 1818-TU) and its\n            Supplement (Loan No. 1915-TU). The policy measures which\n            provide the basis for this new loan are in the areas of: (a)\n            macroeconomic policies - domestic resource mobilization,\n            export promotion, and import liberalization; (b) supply-side\n            policies - public and private investment, energy and\n            agriculture; and (c) reform of the State Economic\n            Enterprises. The loan will finance high priority imports\n            leading to fuller utilization of productive capacity in\n            agriculture and industry. For agriculture: fertilizer raw\n            materials and intermediate products ($200 million). For\n            industry: raw materials and intermediate products ($100\n            million). The main risks relate to possible political\n            developments in Turkey which might impede the\n            Government's determination and efforts to carry out the\n            policy reforms
