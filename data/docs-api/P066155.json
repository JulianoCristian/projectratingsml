Some lessons\n            learned included: high-level Government and Federal Tax\n            Service (FTS) ownership of the project and tax\n            administration reforms remained consistently high.\n            Importantly, technical-level ownership and change management\n            within the FTS was embedded through thematic working groups\n            in Ministry of Taxes and Fees (MinTax) and then the FTS.\n            These working groups penetrated very deep into the operating\n            levels of the tax administration and provided strong\n            continuity even through wrenching organizational\n            restructurings and changes in MinTax and FTS leadership. The\n            working groups also functioned, contrary to conventional\n            wisdom which sometimes doubts the efficacy of such change\n            agents internal to an organization, as key channels to\n            introduce and sustain incremental institutional change,\n            modernized business processes, and related automation. It\n            appears that the high organizational pride and esprit de\n            corps so manifest across the entire FTS contributed\n            significantly to this achievement. The importance of the\n            thematic working groups in keeping the banners of ownership,\n            change management and incremental reforms flying through\n            difficult times cannot be over-estimated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Second Tax\n            Administration Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Second Tax\n

          systematic reform, and modernization of the tax\n            administration in Russia, to increase administrative\n            efficiency, strengthen enforcement capacity, enhance skills,\n            and improve tax legislation. Under three general areas - tax\n            administration management; tax administration operations;\n            and, project management - the components will: a) support\n            implementation of the functional structure, which includes\n            the reorganization of territorial, and local tax offices,\n            with further development of the federal level structure\n            based on the organizations, and structure analysis. The\n            review and strengthening of organizational units in MinTax,\n            and at the regional level for formulation of operational\n            strategy will be supported, by targeting operational areas,\n            developing performance indicators, and preparing annual\n            business plans. Moreover, business processes will be\n            standardized, revenue forecasting and tax modeling systems\n            developed, and strategies for managing organizational change\n            supported, as will human resource management, and improved\n            professional ethics. Infrastructure will be developed,\n            including computerization and telecommunications; 2) support\n            the development of a legal and regulatory framework, to\n            assist line ministries in reviewing tax laws and\n            regulations, and strengthen the appeals system. An\n            electronic filing and tax payment accounting systems will be\n            established, while audit and investigation systems will\n            ensure compliance with processing, and
