and efficiency of water supply provision\n            in Kosovo. This environmental assessment reports how adverse\n            environmental impacts will be mitigated. Sand, gravel, and\n            other construction material will be sprayed or transported\n            off site by a covered truck in order to reduce dust\n            circulation, prevent disturbance of the riverbed and to\n            maintain water quality. Hazardous materials will be handled\n            by government-approved and -licensed companies. Metal will\n            be removed from sites and deposited at authorized dealers\n            for recycling. During the operational phase, the noise level\n            will be reduced by limiting activities to reasonable hours.\n            Equipment and machinery will be maintained so as to prevent\n            water and fuel leaks and spills. Appropriate lighting and\n            well-defined safety signs will promote pedestrian safety.\n            Traffic will be controlled by using specified routes and\n            hauling material during off-peak hours.
