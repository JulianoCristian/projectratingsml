This allowed\n            for greater focus on what was important for PDO achievement\n            and course correction, when necessary. Building\n            institutional capacity was critical to the success of this\n            project, especially in the face of political instability.\n            This also enabled the successful roll out of the IT system\n            and the creation of the self-financed Geographic Information\n            System (GIS) Center, which has reduced the registration\n            services' reliance on the state budget and will allow\n            for future investments without straining the government\n            budget. Over the course of this project, separate digital\n            archives were maintained and updated regularly. This was\n            extremely valuable as records could easily be replaced when\n            paper records were lost. As noted, the ability to issue\n            certificates based on these records helped stabilize the\n            country in the aftermath of the violence in the South. Such\n            a practice should be followed elsewhere, especially in\n            politically volatile countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic  - Second Land and Real\n            Estate
