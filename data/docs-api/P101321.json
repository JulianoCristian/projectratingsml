Some\n            lessons learned included: it is essential for the Bank to\n            work in close collaboration with the International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) and other development partners in development\n            policy loan (DPL) operations to ensure complementarities and\n            increase the likelihood of success of the overall program. A\n            single DPL can be a useful entry point to address an\n            emergency and to engage with a country where the Bank had no\n            on-going macroeconomic policy dialogue for an extended\n            period. The Bank proceeded to support the government's\n            reform program that was conceptually sound, but the risk of\n            failure was high due to the magnitude of problems facing the\n            country especially the high government debt and limited\n            fiscal space to support economic growth. Under such\n            conditions, the Bank may alternatively consider focusing\n            more of its efforts on institutional strengthening, such as\n            through advisory services to build capacity and to\n            participate with significant funding in a broader reform\n            program supported by IMF and other International Financial\n            Institutions

were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the programmatic approach to policy based lending\n            has two main advantages: it provides a medium term\n            perspective to a reform program, coupled with more\n            flexibility than a conventional multi-tranche loan. It is\n            particularly suitable when the agenda includes difficult\n            reforms, which cannot be implemented all at once. But even\n            in cases, such as this development policy loan (DPL), where\n            for various reasons the Bank decides to go with a self\n            standing operation, the policy matrix should have a longer\n            term horizon and be designed as if it were a programmatic\n            DPL, as in this operation. Such a matrix provides a context\n            to the prior actions of a DPL, and it would be the basis for\n            following operations if and when they materialize.\n            Implementation of the DPL could have been helped by a better\n            synchronization' and coordination of technical\n            assistance provided by donors: Given the weaknesses in the\n            local civil service, TA should focus on capacity'\n            building and public sector modernization in accordance with\n            the timing of implementation of the DPL program. Since\n            Jamaica has been over studied, what is needed is\n            strengthening the local capacity to implement policies in\n            timely manner. A combination of longer term presence of\n            experts in the country coupled with on the job training of\n            local staff in donor countries will help achieve the\n            Government's development objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Fiscal and Debt Sustainability\n            Development Policy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Fiscal and

policies for macroeconomic\n            stability and helping to improve the efficiency and\n            effectiveness of public spending and investment decisions.\n            Specifically, the loan
