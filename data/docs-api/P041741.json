While the World\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory, the Borrowers was\n            mixed. Key lessons were learned in the following areas: A\n            strong government commitment was critical to achieving the\n            project's objectives. Monitoring and supervision are\n            important, especially in the early phase of reforms when\n            slippage may occur. Project objectives should give priority\n            to measures relevant to law implementation and enforcement\n            rather than approval / establishment. Reform of the banking\n            sector in transitional economies is a very slow process that\n            requires investment and changes in institutions, legal\n            infrastructure, and human capital. More attention should be\n            paid to the fiscal consequences of banking sector reforms,\n            in order to assess short-term and long-term costs. When\n            institution building is crucial for a project's\n            objectives, as it is in transition economies, structural\n            adjustment operations that provide a road agenda for reform\n            in particular sectors should be accompanied and supported by\n            parallel, well designed and timely technical assistance\n            projects.

The adjustment program will tackle the main\n            structural problems of the banking and enterprise sectors\n            through an integrated approach that broadly aims to restore\n            the banking system as an efficient and safe intermediator of\n            resources, and to improve the economic and financial\n            performance of select public and recently privatized\n            enterprises. BESAC will support: the bank restructuring\n            strategy including liquidation of the two insolvent banks,\n            loan recovery efforts through the development of a debt\n            workout unit (DWU) in the Trade and Development Bank, and\n            halting the flow of loans to defaulting borrowers. In the\n            enterprise sector, BESAC will assist the imposition of hard\n            budget constraints, and passively restructure or liquidate\n            six selected state-owned enterprises to jump-start more\n            widespread restructuring in the rest of the economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Banking and Enterprise Sector\n            Adjustment Credit
