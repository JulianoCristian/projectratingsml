the first single-tranche that began\n            in 2012. The goal of the INSTANSI DPL series is to assist\n            the Government of Indonesia to achieve its medium-term\n            growth, poverty reduction, and shared prosperity objectives\n            by supporting measures to enhance Indonesia's capacity\n            and institutions for targeting poverty reduction measures,\n            introducing a major social insurance program, and enhancing\n            the management of public finances for better service\n            delivery. The operation was previously envisioned to be the\n            second of a two-year, programmatic DPL series. However, the\n            government has recently indicated the possibility of\n            extending the series from two to three years. Tentative\n            triggers for a third operation have been developed. The\n            INSTANSI DPL-2 Project supports a set of policy actions\n            surrounding the following two pillars: (i) enhancing poverty\n            alleviation and shared prosperity efforts through improved\n            governance and institutional accountability, better\n            measurement and targeting of the poor and vulnerable in\n            social assistance programs, and implementation of a new\n            national social security system (Sistem Jaminan Sosial\n            Nasional, SJSN); and (ii) strengthening public financial\n            management (PFM) through improvements in the medium-term\n            results orientation of the budget process, the introduction\n            of a more efficient and effective automated budget and\n
