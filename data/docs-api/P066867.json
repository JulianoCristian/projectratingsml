Viewed as a\n            whole, a major project acomplishment was greatly to raise\n            the visibility of the decentralization issue, i.e., to\n            elevate the issue on the Mexican political agenda from\n            \"important\" to \"urgent.\" Project\n            sustainability is considered as likely. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated as highly satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include the following: Borrower commitment\n            is critical to project success. Implementing fundamental\n            reform is a long-term process: the lessons of international\n            experience in decentralization showed that it was best to\n            proceed at a judicious pace, and a conscious decision was\n            made to limit the scope of the project and defer additional\n            decentralization actions. Transparency can be critical to\n            institutional development impact. Publication of fiscal and\n            financial information by the states, as part of the credit\n            rating process and as required by the new rules for\n            sub-national borrowing, has increased their public\n            accountability and motivated improvements in fiscal performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Decentralization Adjustment Loan

and accountability to the country's\n            rapidly moving decentralization process. In particular, the\n            DAL will support four immediate policy objectives - imposing\n            hard budget constraints on federal resources, provided to\n            states and municipalities; reducing moral hazard in\n            sub-national borrowing; increasing transparency and public\n            accountability of sub-national fiscal, and financial\n            management; and, setting pilot mechanisms to enhance\n            efficiency in decentralized expenditures, with an emphasis\n            on health, and environment related issues. The DAL will be\n            disbursed in two tranches, and implemented within the\n            context of an ongoing International Monetary Fund Stand-by\n            operation, and parallel financing from the Inter-American\n            Development Bank. However, several risks may hinder success,\n            given the difficulties in obtaining consensus for the\n            necessary reforms, following the upcoming elections,\n            including the possibility of refusal, from some\n            states/municipalities, in adopting what may be viewed, as\n            imposition. But while financial-sector related technical\n            difficulties may also threaten program objectives, the\n            project design placed an emphasis on avoiding the need for\n            legislative action."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Decentralization Adjustment Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Decentralization\n            Adjustment
