Some lessons learned included: it is essential\n            to maintain a platform for basin-wide dialogue and to\n            continue activities at a technical level in an uncertain\n            political context for cooperation. This is a key principle\n            for any regional institution owned by its member states. The\n            role and added value should be explicit, with the regional\n            institution only undertaking activities which cannot be\n            undertaken by the individual countries. Overall whilst Nile\n            Basin Initiative (NBI) was established by agreement of all\n            member states, there is concern that this is faltering and\n            potentially fragmenting as a result of losing relevance for\n            some countries. NBI is one institution with three centers,\n            each forming an important part of the whole, with strength\n            together, and respect for subsidiarity. ISP was designed\n            with three year duration. With the slow start up (due to\n            capacity deficits at the lead Centre which should have been\n            foreseen), two key studies were delayed which had knock-on\n            efforts throughout the project implementation. The Mid-Term\n            Review (MTR) recommended a time extension that enabled the\n            NBI to satisfactory complete the project. In general,\n            institutional strengthening operations should be of\n            sufficient duration to allow for reflection and\n            self-learning as part of strengthening."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa - Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa - Institutional\n            Strengthening Project
