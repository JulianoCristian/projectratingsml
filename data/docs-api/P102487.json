The project\n            will support policy reforms that will: (i) improve the\n            Government\u0092s capacity to diversify and improve financing\n            mechanisms; (ii) modernize the governance and management\n            efficacy of the sector; and (iii) strengthen quality\n            assurance and accreditation mechanisms. Project has 3\n            components. Component 1: Sustainable Financing for Quality.\n            This component will build the capacity of Ministry of Higher\n            Education and Scientific Research to introduce new funding\n            mechanisms to promote transparency, innovation and effective\n            resource management, including support for competitive\n            program funding and establishing a Student Aid Agency.\n            Component 2: Modernize Governance, Accountability and\n            Management Systems. This component aims to strengthen the\n            management performance and accountability of universities\n            and the overall sector by strengthening the transparency and\n            quality of decision making. Component 3: Strengthen Quality\n            Assurance and Accreditation. This component aims to improve\n            the employability of men and women graduates of university\n            and community colleges programs, and to help enhance the\n            international competitiveness of higher education\n            institutions in Jordan, through more effective quality\n            assurance mechanisms and accreditation standards. The\n            project will finance training, consulting services, and\n            goods for the development of accreditation standards and\n            capacity building for program review,
