The project\n            achieved or exceeded most of it objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development was moderate, sustainability is\n            uncertain, and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower\n            was satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the association of a SECAL operation and an\n            ongoing investment operation is a practical alternative to a\n            hybrid loan. Second, centralized maintenance of scattered\n            rural facilities is not sustainable, even if it is carried\n            out by a private company. Third, a technical department of\n            the central government that is deprived of financial\n            incentives and accountability should not be expected manage\n            and make responsible investment decisions. Finally, projects\n            that aim at developing the connection ratio and water\n            services to the urban poor should systematically measure the\n            actual willingness to pay of
