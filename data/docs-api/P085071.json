Some lessons\n            learned includes: project ownership. The beneficiary is a\n            fundamental requirement for successful outcomes. The General\n            Department of Vietnam Customs (GDVC) has not abandoned its\n            objectives but chosen to adopt a different financing path to\n            meet their Information and Communications Technology (ICT)\n            needs other than through the VCMP. Project implementation\n            design quality. A realistic, detailed implementation plan is\n            an essential underpinning of any investment project. The CMP\n            was prepared relatively quickly with the assistance of a\n            Policy and Human Resource Development Fund (PHRD) grant, but\n            project implementation arrangements were not fully adequate\n            and implementation schedule was overoptimistic without clear\n            sequencing and no provision for delay. Project management\n            unit format and capacity. The CMP Project Management Unit\n            (PMU) proved unable to manage the planned institutional\n            development program in such a way as to meet the\n            implementation schedule. Due to delays it was not fully\n            tested in managing an infrastructure investment program. The\n            enclave format has merit in regard to investment project\n            management not least in simplifying the fiduciary duties of\n            the parties but is less effective in fostering institutional\n            development which typically benefits from an integrated\n            format in which the unit is embedded in the\n            institution's own functional structure. Supervision and\n            monitoring. Project progress was monitored by sector\n            management and the country portfolio management team through\n            the Implementation Supervision Report (ISR) system reports,\n            and by Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and\n            Ministry of Finance (MoF) through the Aligned Monitoring\n            Tool (AMT) reports which were also available to the Bank\n            task team and portfolio management team. The aides-memoir of\n            the early missions identified emerging implementation issues\n            and although helpful suggestions were made the measures\n            proposed were not always fully successful. ISR reports\n            lacked some detail and did not sufficiently highlight the\n            consequences of increasingly serious delays and project\n            management weaknesses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Customs Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Customs Modernization

facilitate trade and increase revenue\n            collection, improve the production of foreign trade\n            statistics, and enhance community protection and national\n            security by improving the effectiveness, efficiency,\n            accountability and transparency of the Customs\n            Administration. In addition, the project would be a key\n            factor in facilitating Vietnam's accession to the World\n            Trade Organization and securing the gains from greater\n            integration into the world trading system. The project is\n            expected to meet these objectives by: (1) introducing modern\n            Customs systems and procedures based on internationally\n            agreed standards and best practice; (2) improving the\n            organizational structure and strengthening the human,\n            financial and physical resource capacity o f the Customs\n            Department; and (3) introducing appropriate information and\n            communication technology to improve effectiveness, increase\n            transparency, and lower transaction costs. The project\n            provides consulting services, training, technical assistance\n            and appropriate infrastructure to support three key\n            operational components, and one support component: Component\n            one deals with the core technical systems, and procedural\n            aspects of the reform program. Component two improves the\n            organizational and resource management of the new systems.\n            Component three provides the information and communication\n            technology (ICT) support to achieve world class standards of\n            performance in Customs administration. Component four\n            provides the technical and managerial support required to\n            achieve effective implementation and long term\n            sustainability of project objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -
