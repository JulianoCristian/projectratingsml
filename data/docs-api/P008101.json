Some\n            key lessons learned and recommendations follow: 1) important\n            factors for project sustainability are the linkages among\n            the private industry, the government and public entities, as\n            well as coordination with the respective ministry, i.e., for\n            the provision or access to facilities, equipment, human\n            resources and technical expertise; 2) an institutional\n            framework should be in place to ease national policies and\n            delineate areas of responsibility; 3) decision making,\n            flexibility and creativity are paramount areas in the\n            vitality of a successful operation, and a constant\n            institutional strengthening provides the likelihood for\n            sustainable projects; 4) selection of courses, responding to\n            client and industry demands may be better obtained through a\n            timely and accurate labor market information; 5) flexibility\n            in the cycle schedule and training modules facilitated the\n            movement from level to level; 6) evidence suggests that the\n            Career Enhancement Program was vital for a successful\n            operation, and it should be strengthened in future\n            operations; and, 7) the Microenterprise Development Program\n            however, hindered success, thus substantial time should be\n            allowed for such programs to take off."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Trinidad and Tobago - Youth Training and\n            Employment Partnership Project (YTEPP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Trinidad and Tobago - Youth\n            Training and Employment Partnership Project (YTEPP)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/12/728014/trinidad-tobago-youth-training-employment-partnership-project-ytepp","projn":"TT-Youth Trg&Empl Proj -- P008101","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,ICT Policy and Strategies,Educational Sciences,Primary Education,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Information and Communication Technologies,Education","count":"Trinidad and Tobago","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99030406253996"},"subsc":"Adult literacy/non-formal education,Central government administration,Vocational training,General industry and trade sector,Micro- and SME finance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Information and Communication Technologies,Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACHIEVEMENT,attention,Basic\n            Education,Business Development,business\n            plans,Career,collaboration,commercial\n            banks,counselors,curriculum,Distance Learning,education\n            sector,Employment,expenditures,Gender,Human\n            Development,human\n            resources,instruction,instructors,literacy,motivation,numeracy,principals,programming,public\n            agencies,schools,secondary education,secondary school\n            teachers,skills training,teacher,teaching,teaching\n            staff,technical assistance,technical\n            training,trainees,training activities,training\n            centers,training courses,training facilities,training\n            programs,tutoring,vocational education,vocational\n            skills,work experience,workers,Youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"ACHIEVEMENT,attention,Basic\n            Education,Business Development,business\n            plans,Career,collaboration,commercial\n            banks,counselors,curriculum,Distance Learning,education\n            sector,Employment,expenditures,Gender,Human\n            Development,human\n            resources,instruction,instructors,literacy,motivation,numeracy,principals,programming,public\n            agencies,schools,secondary education,secondary school\n            teachers,skills training,teacher,teaching,teaching\n            staff,technical assistance,technical\n            training,trainees,training activities,training\n            centers,training courses,training facilities,training\n            programs,tutoring,vocational education,vocational\n            skills,work experience,workers,Youth"}},"owner":"Human Development (LCSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"trustfund":"TF028194-DEET-LABOR MARKET CONSULTANCY\n            (ALAN ABRAHART),TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
