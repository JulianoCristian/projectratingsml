The\n            Economic Recovery Credit Project had the following ratings:\n            outcome was highly satisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was not evaluable; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The Economic Management Credit Project had the\n            following ratings: outcome was moderately satisfactory;\n            sustainability was likely; institutional development impact\n            was modest; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The Third Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project had the following ratings: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was modest; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from this review are:\n            1) Country ownership matters very much. The components of\n            the loans that were owned by the country, such as the public\n            resource management and some of the structural adjustment\n            components were generally successfully implemented; 2) As a\n            general rule, it would be very useful for the Bank to listen\n            better and to go to extra lengths to explain it s positions,\n            and to solicit views and seek genuine agreement with country\n            authorities. This could improve country ownership of\n            programs; 3) It is important to keep a good and substantive\n            dialogue with the main development partners; again by\n            listening better to their view points, keeping them better\n            informed about those of the Bank, and seeking to reach\n            agreements when possible; and 4) As has happened already\n            with the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit, it would be\n            preferable to keep the design of adjustment operations\n            simple and focused on a limited number of key policy areas,\n            whose implementation can be realistically expected within\n            the short disbursement period dictated by an adjustment operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - First

sustainability likely, although the\n            institutional development impact is negligible. Lessons are\n            as follows. Policy-based lending has been an effective\n            mechanism of support in Mali, but structural adjustment\n            credits may not be the best mechanism for supporting public\n            enterprise divestitures. Privatization is a complex process,\n            particularly given the fragility of Mali's economy and\n            high vulnerability to exogenous shocks, thereby forcing the\n            Bank to either amend its conditionality, or penalize the\n            government for good performance under difficult\n            circumstances. The Bank supported a process that would not\n            only be anti-competitive in outcome, but which was also\n            likely to be markedly less attractive to potential\n            investors; similarly, the Bank's acquiescence in the\n            government's decision not to use an investment advisor,\n            in a country fraught with capacity weaknesses, further\n            weakened the likelihood of privatization success. This also\n            suggests the need to ensure up-front that key implementing\n            institutions have sufficient resources, since the shortfall\n            of other donor funding had the potential to substantially\n            undermine credit implementation. Instead, future operations\n            should explicitly ensure that funding, technical assistance,\n            etc. be reliably available; alternatively, provision of such\n            funding should be included in the Bank's operation to\n            make certain that it is forthcoming. Other lessons outline\n            the need for maintaining a tight focus on a limited number\n            of reforms; for an effective partnership with donors; and,\n            for an effective partnership with the International Monetary Fund."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Third Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Third Structural\n
