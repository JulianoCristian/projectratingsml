Some\n            lessons learned included: policy-based lending at the state\n            level has been a huge winner for the Bank. This is a\n            conclusion drawn from a more general analysis of\n            policy-based lending at the state level. There is no doubt\n            that lending to support state reforms has made a large\n            positive impact, and perhaps its biggest contribution to\n            reforms, both in India at large and in AP in particular.\n            While this loan does not contradict this general conclusion,\n            and there are concrete reform gains one can point to, it\n            does also give rise to a few lessons of a more cautionary\n            nature. Over the years, the Bank took a flexible approach on\n            AP in relation to difficult issues, such as the power sector\n            reform. Although there can be trade-offs between flexibility\n            and credibility, overall a large degree of flexibility is\n            needed, not least so that past mistakes can be corrected.\n            The price for inflexibility can be very high both in terms\n            of a reform relationship and the ability to reach project\n            development objectives. Long delays between loans and loan\n            tranches lead to a loss of reform momentum, and can lead to\n            an unraveling of relationship. The decision to move to a\n            two-tranche approach was a decision of the Government of\n            India, apparently because it thought this will introduce\n            greater discipline. However, as evidenced here, two-tranche\n            operations result in less flexibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Andrah Pradesh Economic Reform\n            Loan and Credit Development

implementation of the third policy-based operation in\n            support of the State of Andhra Pradesh medium term\n            development program. It focuses on the actions taken by the\n            Government of Andhra Pradesh (GoAP) to meet the specific\n            conditions for the release of the second tranche of the\n            Third Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform Loan/Credit Project\n            (APERL3). APERL3 is the third in a series of programmatic\n            budget support operations to Andhra Pradesh (AP). It\n            provides financial support for the implementation of a\n            policy and institutional reform program of the GoAP, which\n            has been under implementation for over a decade. The first\n            of these loans, Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform Loan (APERL1)\n            was approved in March 2002, APERL2 in February 2004, and\n            APERL3 in January 2007. While the first two budget support\n            operations comprised only one tranche, APERL3 was designed\n            as a two-tranche operation in accordance with the Government\n            of India's guidelines for policy-based assistance to\n            states. The next section describes the overall\n            macro-economic policy framework in India as well as recent\n            trends in development outcomes in Andhra Pradesh. Section\n            three discusses progress in the implementation of the GoAP\n            overall reform program. Section four details the status of\n            specific tranche release conditions. The memorandum\n            concludes that the conditions for the release of the second\n            tranche have been met and that substantial progress has been\n            made in implementing the
