Some\n            lessons learned includes: poverty targeting requires clearly\n            defined frameworks and monitoring. The initial problems and\n            the time taken to identify and resolve the poverty targeting\n            approach suggest that future operations will benefit from\n            clearer design targets, stronger indicators, improved\n            assessment and closer monitoring. The lesson from the Lao\n            experience is that this trade off can be justified given the\n            specific poverty reduction objectives, the intention to\n            reach villages in
