Although risks include weak institutional\n            capacity, resistance by interest groups, and slippages in\n            the macroeconomic program, these will be mitigated by\n            focusing on few key reforms through the provision of\n            technical assistance, and, by implementing reforms in\n            collaboration with interested parties, including workers and\n            employers. As per the potential downturn in macroeconomic\n            stabilization, the project will complement the policy\n            actions supported by the International Monetary Fund, by\n
