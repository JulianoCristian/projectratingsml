Lessons\n            suggest: 1) over-ambitious project design results in slow\n            implementation, and will thus require restructuring; 2) lack\n            of staff continuity, both by the Bank and borrower, can\n            undermine successful project implementation; 3) donor\n            coordination requires a serious degree of commitment to\n            sector approaches, both from government, and donors to\n            ensure success. However, project design should not be based\n            on a sector approach until there is clear indication that\n            such an approach will actually be adopted; 4) attempts at\n            community mobilization failed as the adopted approach,\n            fostered an insufficient sense of ownership in the\n            community. This experience contrasts with that in some other\n            African countries, in which social funds have successfully\n            mobilized communities to contribute to school construction,\n            and then maintain them. However, community financing for\n            school facilities can create disparities in the quality of\n            schooling - and has already done so in Ghana. Such biases\n            need to be offset by direct support from the government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Primary School Development, and\n            Basic Education Sector Improvement Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana -

In key policy and management changes, the\n            inputs will be:  (a) increasing official teaching hours from\n            4 hours a day to at least 5 a day; (b) ensuring that\n            District Education Officers do not arrange any functions or\n            activities for schoolteachers during official teaching\n            hours; (c) eliminating all fees and levies that are not\n            officially endorsed by the Ministry of Education and that\n            are currently imposed on primary school students; (d)\n            involving communities in the selection of headteachers; (e)\n            training and re-training of circuit monitoring assistants;\n            and (f) strengthening the Ministry of Education's\n            implementation, monitoring and planning capacity.
