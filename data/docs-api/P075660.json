Lessons learned from the project: The success\n            of EERP confirms both post conflict intervention theory and\n            practice in other countries (in particular the Balkans). The\n            project corroborates the relevance of a flexible strategic\n            and programmatic approach. The ring-fenced approach has both\n            positive and negative aspects. The project demonstrates that\n            it is worthwhile to take measured risks. The project also\n            demonstrates the benefits of having a locally-based task\n            team leader, in a context such as Democratic Republic of\n            Congo (DRC).
