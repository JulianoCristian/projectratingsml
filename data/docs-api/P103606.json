Some lessons\n            learned included: project management on the Bank side needs\n            to be sufficiently thought through and adequately funded to\n            ensure that there is sufficient support to implementation.\n            An important contributing factor to the success of project\n            implementation was the strong management of the project by\n            the Bank and the implementing agency. With the Government\n            firmly in the driver seat, the investment was seen as the\n            next logical step in Bank support and was tailored with a\n            comprehensive view of the sector in mind. The project was\n            able to jump start implementation right after effectiveness\n            because it took advantage of the capacity built in the areas\n            of procurement and financial management. The implementation\n            arrangements took advantage of Ministry of Health, Family\n            Planning and Social Protection (MOH) staff in these areas\n            that had been working on Bank projects. The project\n            implemented pilots as a strategic way to test interventions\n            with the intention of scaling up models that worked.\n            Therefore, baseline data was collected and there was\n            financing for proper evaluations. This should be considered\n            good practice in the context of Bank operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Sustainable Health System\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar -

health system, including financing, delivery and\n            management, in order to improve the access and utilization\n            of health services, especially in rural and remote areas,\n            and scale-up the production and delivery of health programs\n            with an emphasis on endemic infectious diseases,\n            reproductive health (including family planning sexually\n            transmitted diseases, and HIV/AIDS) andNutrition.

Suggested mitigation measures are : used syringes\n            must be discard immediately; syringes will not be used\n            twice; toxic waste and bio-medical waste will disposed to a\n            previously selected site; no bio-medical waste (BMW)\n            management structure will be constructed within 100 meters\n            of a surface waterbeds or wetlands; to preserve water supply\n            sources; infectious waste, such as : sharps, chemical and\n            pharmaceuticals, used radioactives, broken thermometers will\n            be disposed to an incinerator or treated before sent to\n            waste disposal site; encourage hospital staff to reduce\n            medical waste by 50kg/daily; follow the norms of\n            environmental and medical / hospital best practices prepared\n            by the Ministry of Health, particularly during vaccination\n            campaigns and everyday shots / injections given at hospital\n            and clinics; never re-sterilize syringes; always follow-up\n            for Manifestation of Adverse Post Injections (MAPI); comply\n            with the joint declaration of OMS, UNICEF, FNUAP of December\n            1999 when conducting vaccination campaigns; electrical and\n            electronic equipment, tubes-lights and bulbs that becomes\n            obsolete will be stored and sent for recycling; to reduce\n            the effects of excessive noise, unloading bays, refuse\n            disposal areas, boiler houses, workshops, laundry and\n            kitchen areas should placed far from hospital sensitive\n            areas;
