Some lessons\n            learned included: the lack of any formal evaluation of\n            project performance until the Implementation Completion and\n            Results Report, or ICR has left inherent weaknesses and\n            performance issues undiscovered for too long. In future,\n            regular mid-term reviews should be held, and sector units\n            should strongly consider the option of a series of\n            programmatic or repeater projects to carry out a long\n            mandate such as this. Such an approach will allow regular\n            opportunities to reassess the project design and objectives\n            and will help to ensure that a large gap does not develop\n            between the intended purpose of the project and its actual\n            activities. This lesson is widely applicable across the Bank\n            portfolio, but in most cases regular review is already in\n            place and prevents 'mission creep' from reaching\n            the very large proportions it reached in the case of this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -

The project consists of two main components\n            involving institutional strengthening and technology\n            transfer. The technology development component includes the\n            following: 1) in the refrigeration sector, introduction of\n            hydrofluorocarbon 134a (HFC-134a) as a refrigerant replacing\n            chlorofluorocarbon 12 (CFC-12), replacement of CFC-11 as a\n            foam-blowing agent by a low CFC and/or non-CFC substance,\n            and the introduction of a CFC-recycling and refrigeration\n            maintenance program to train refrigeration technicians how\n            to recycle CFCs and handle non-ODS refrigerants; 2) flexible\n            foam which will demonstrate the replacement of CFC-11 with a\n            non-ODS substitute; and 3) an aerosol component which will\n            consist of a sectoral study in order to determine the full\n            technical and financial needs for technology development.\n            Finally, the institutional strengthening component will\n            consist of establishing the Ozone Project Implementation\n            Unit which will be responsible for execution of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Phaseout of Ozone Depleting\n            Substances Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Phaseout of Ozone\n            Depleting Substances Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/04/440225/tunisia-phaseout-ozone-depleting-substances-project","projn":"TN-Ozone Depleting Substance -- P005591","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Climate Change and Environment,Montreal Protocol,Global Environment Facility","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the Director","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810191126415"},"subsc":"Other industry,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"annual report,Audits,carbon,carbon\n            tetrachloride,CFC,CFC\n            12,CFCs,Chlorofluorocarbons,CO2,Consumption Patterns,cost\n            savings,cyclopentane,developed\n            countries,emissions,environmental\n            protection,Expenditures,gases,Halon,halons,HC,HCFC,information\n            dissemination,insulation,Methylene Chloride,MFMP,Montreal\n            Protocol,Negotiations,ODS,OTF,Ozone,Ozone Depleting\n            Potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,OZONE PROJECTS TRUST\n            FUND,ozone protection,Pollution,Pollution\n            control,polyols,Private Sector,producers,production\n            processes,programs,recycling,Refrigeration,retirement,rigid\n            foams,safety,safety measures,stratospheric ozone\n            layer,ultraviolet radiation,UNEP,United Nations Environment Programme"},"1":{"cdata!":"annual report,Audits,carbon,carbon\n            tetrachloride,CFC,CFC\n            12,CFCs,Chlorofluorocarbons,CO2,Consumption Patterns,cost\n            savings,cyclopentane,developed\n            countries,emissions,environmental\n            protection,Expenditures,gases,Halon,halons,HC,HCFC,information\n            dissemination,insulation,Methylene Chloride,MFMP,Montreal\n            Protocol,Negotiations,ODS,OTF,Ozone,Ozone Depleting\n            Potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,OZONE PROJECTS TRUST\n            FUND,ozone protection,Pollution,Pollution\n            control,polyols,Private Sector,producers,production\n            processes,programs,recycling,Refrigeration,retirement,rigid\n            foams,safety,safety measures,stratospheric ozone\n            layer,ultraviolet radiation,UNEP,United Nations Environment Programme"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF021936-OTF - TUNISIA ODS PHASEOUT PROJECT","repnb":"12490","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Ozone Trust Fund Grant"}}},"facets":{}}}
