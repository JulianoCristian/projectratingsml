Some lessons learned included: the\n            project showed that a country can deliver reliable property\n            records and improved tenure security in a relatively short\n            time through building interest for and commitment to land\n            policy work and support to new laws. In particular,\n            Government support was critical for moving from completely\n            public sector responsibility for surveying work to the\n            private sector, simplifying the procedures for achieving\n            completion of the REC, initiating regularization of illegal\n            buildings, and improving procedures for access to, and\n            sharing of, land and real estate data. At the same time,\n            willingness at the top level is required to transform the\n            culture of an organization from an inward looking to an\n            outward looking, customer oriented agency that strives to\n            deliver better services more quickly and efficiently. Though\n            its reforms to laws, ICT and office design were important,\n            AREC\u2019s purposeful decision to reach out to its customers\n            (both citizens and professional customers) through new\n            services, new technology, training for its staff, and new\n            means of communicating with customers, stemmed from a clear\n            change of approach by top level management to make\n            customers\u2019 satisfaction the organization\u2019s central focus.\n            Further, the ability of the project to show early results\n            was critical for building momentum for further reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of -\n            Real Estate Cadastre and Registration
