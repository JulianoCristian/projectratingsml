The main\n            project risk is that the free distribution of seedlings\n            might lead to some waste. Experience in other projects\n            indicates strong demand for seedlings but statistics of\n            their survival rate are inadequate. Another risk is that\n            village panchayats might lack sufficient leadership and\n            incentive to assume responsibility for village woodlots.\n            These risks would be minimized by the careful monitoring and\n            supervision of planting programs, and public information and\n            education efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana Social\n            Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Jammu and Kashmir and\n            Haryana Social Forestry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/06/725731/india-jammu-kashmir-haryana-social-forestry-project","projn":"IN-Haryana & J.K.
