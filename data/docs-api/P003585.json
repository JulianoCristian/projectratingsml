Distressed SOEs\n            should be sold to private investors, who should then be free\n            to restructure the enterprise to make it market-competitive.\n            Private sector development -- A Bank-financed line of credit\n            through financial intermediaries is clearly insufficient to\n            promote private sector development. Governments and the\n            World Bank Group should focus on the complete spectrum of\n            investment climate issues. SOE reform needs to be addressed\n            top-down. Key issues include the effectiveness of the state\n            shareholder; organization and procedures for corporate\n            governance of SOEs; open processes for SOE privatization;\n            adequacy of worker safety nets; and maintenance of hard\n            budget constraints for both SOEs and private businesses. Any\n            insistence by a government that it needs to borrow only (or\n            mostly) for hardware (e.g., equipment, works) instead of\n            software (e.g., technical consultants, training) should be\n            viewed with caution. In the case of this Project, greater\n            efforts on the soft side (e.g., training for credit analysis\n            and supervision, working capital management, corporate\n            governance) might have led to better developmental outcomes.\n            If the Bank finances a line of credit, it is not enough to\n            rely on ex ante criteria for approval of sub-loans. The PFI\n            should also monitor repayment performance by sub-borrowers\n            and respond effectively to the emergence of defaults or\n            distress among sub-borrowers. For long-duration projects,\n            the appraisal process should take care to develop realistic\n            operating/financial projections, assess sensitivities, and\n            identify remedial actions in case of performance shortfalls."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Shenyang Industrial Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Shenyang Industrial\n            Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3067045/china-shenyang-industrial-reform-project","projn":"CN-Shenyang Ind.
