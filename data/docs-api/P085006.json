Credit proceeds\n            will be re-allocated to reflect the newly agreed scope of\n            the project. The original amount of the credit will be\n            reduced by ten million US dollars (equivalent to SDR 6.931\n            million) and cancelled from the credit. The partial\n            cancellation amount will be re-committed to the general\n            International Development Association (IDA) pool for Ghana\n            and towards support for fast moving projects. Project\n            outcomes are unchanged; however, the outcome indicators are\n            being modified to better reflect the revised scope of the\n            project. The changes in the results framework include: a)\n            transforming the Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            indicators into a set of Specific, Measurable, Attributable,\n            Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) indicators which reflect the\n            intentions and content of the original PDO; b) consolidating\n            and revising a number of indicators to ensure they are\n            relevant and clearly defined; c) dropping a number of\n            indicators that appear to be of little relevance to the\n            revised project, and/or lack data sources; and d) two\n            separate lists of indicators.
