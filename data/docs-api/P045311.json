Before war erupted in Bosnia and Herzegovina in\n            1992, the country\u2019s economy was based on heavy and military\n            industry, and dominated by several large state-owned\n            conglomerates. A major part of this economy was destroyed\n            during the conflict. As a result, the country was left\n            without the most basic infrastructure and services, and\n            suffered from significant unemployment. People had a hard\n            time launching new businesses since the commercial banking\n            sector was embryonic.

Regardless of success,\n            lessons address the following. Particularly appropriate, was\n            the decision to contract nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs) as implementing partners, given the post-conflict\n            context in the country, for although other legal entities\n            were also eligible, NGOs' comparative advantages, met\n            the needs for micro-credit services provision. However,\n            financial/business skills, and management capacity vary\n            across NGOs; most likely, micro-credit organizations\n            combining client-driven approaches, with strong business\n            management will succeed. This was largely due to the\n            investments in technical assistance, and training, which\n            strengthened micro-finance institutions' capacity in\n            micro-credit operations, and, likewise, their\n            performance-based financing provided incentives to\n            strengthen their institutional, and financial performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Local Initiatives Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Local\n            Initiatives Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/12/1000498/bosnia-herzegovina-local-initiatives-project","projn":"BA-Local Initiatives Project -- P045311","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Finance,Microfinance,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Private Participation in Infrastructure,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01022705321922"},"subsc":"Micro- and SME finance,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,Actual Cost,apex,apex\n            institutions,Audits,Bank Performance,banking\n            sector,Borrower,borrowing,business development,business\n            environment,commercial\n            banks,commitment,Company,consolidation,cost of capital,cost\n            of\n            funds,deposits,disbursement,disbursements,Employment,ethnic\n            groups,financial institutions,Financial management,financial\n            performance,financial services,Financial\n            Structure,firms,FISCAL YEAR,IDA CREDIT,Institutional\n            Development,job creation,Key Performance Indicators,legal\n            framework,legislation,leverage,loan,loan disbursements,loan\n            size,MFI,microcredit,Microcredit\n            Programs,microcredits,microenterprises,microentrepreneurs,Microfinance,microfinance\n            industry,Microfinance Institution,microfinance\n            institutions,microfinance sector,Ministries of\n            Finance,Operating costs,operating expenses,operating\n            income,outreach,Performance\n            Standards,Profitability,regulatory framework,return on\n            assets,savings,small businesses,support\n            services,Sustainability,sustainable microfinance,sustainable\n            microfinance institutions,technical assistance,technical support"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,Actual Cost,apex,apex\n            institutions,Audits,Bank Performance,banking\n            sector,Borrower,borrowing,business development,business\n            environment,commercial\n            banks,commitment,Company,consolidation,cost of capital,cost\n            of\n            funds,deposits,disbursement,disbursements,Employment,ethnic\n            groups,financial institutions,Financial management,financial\n            performance,financial services,Financial\n            Structure,firms,FISCAL YEAR,IDA CREDIT,Institutional\n            Development,job creation,Key Performance Indicators,legal\n            framework,legislation,leverage,loan,loan disbursements,loan\n            size,MFI,microcredit,Microcredit\n            Programs,microcredits,microenterprises,microentrepreneurs,Microfinance,microfinance\n            industry,Microfinance Institution,microfinance\n            institutions,microfinance sector,Ministries of\n            Finance,Operating costs,operating expenses,operating\n            income,outreach,Performance\n            Standards,Profitability,regulatory framework,return on\n            assets,savings,small businesses,support\n            services,Sustainability,sustainable microfinance,sustainable\n            microfinance institutions,technical assistance,technical support"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024086-BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA -\n            SWISS EMERGENCY REHABILITATION TF,TF023572-LOCAL INITIATIVES PROJECT,TF021194-BHZ - LOCAL INITIATIVES PROJECT\n            - II,TF024076-BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA - LOCAL\n            INIATIVES - AUSTRIAN GRANT,TF024768-PHRD-LOCAL INITIATIVES PROJECT,TF024775-BHZ - 1998 DUTCH GRANT FOR\n            LOCAL INITIATIVES,TF024083-BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA -\n            LOCAL INITIATIVE PROJECT,TF020873-RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM\n            PREPARATION (BANK EX.),TF020212-ADVISORY SERVICES AND TECH.
