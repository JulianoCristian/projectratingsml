Some key lessons cited from the project\n            were: 1) The establishment of a strongly staffed, and well\n            managed PIU and PCC led to project success. 2) Adequate\n            project duration should be set. 3) The personnel from\n            supporting agencies (other ministries) should become more\n            familiar with the various Bank guidelines and documentation\n            requirements. 4) Local administrators, coordinators and\n            teachers should be more fully briefed regarding the\n            advantages of participating in the project as well as their\n            responsibilities. 5) Systematic monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) is critical. 6) Lack of cohesion among technical\n            consultants may cause delays in construction, lack of\n            architectural control over the project, and a lack of\n            articulation between various plans and specifications. 7)\n            Teachers were more responsive to changes and innovations\n            when they participated in a continuous professional\n            development model of in-service training. 8) Overseas,\n            long-term training should only be done when local training\n            capacity is not available. 9) In large scale staff\n            development programs, ensure that specific selection\n            criteria are well established, and that the subsequent\n            selection process closely follows the established criteria.\n            10) Government assignment of currently employed, MOE staff\n            to the project for the duration helped to turnover of hired\n            technical staff Also, the selection and assignment of\n            multiple understudies to each technical staff provided some\n            redundancy when key staff resigned; Other lessons concerned\n            management information systems development and curriculum/\n            pedagogical development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia - Education Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malaysia - Education Sector\n            Support
