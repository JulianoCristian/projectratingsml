This rating is\n            based on the fulfillment of economic objectives, completion\n            of the physical components, and, a satisfactory current\n            operation. In addition, the development of the regulatory\n            framework, exceeded project expectations. The key lessons\n            suggest that, although some implementation problems could\n            have been solved with more detailed preparation, and\n            identification of training needs, the strong Project\n            Implementation Unit conveyed the responsibility, through\n            staff continuity, required for changing circumstances.\n            Supervision cost effectiveness succeeded, in that, due to\n            the modest project size (relative to its budget, supervision\n            costs can be substantial), individual consultants were\n            hired, instead of the more expensive approach of a company,\n            with the traditional and permanent field staff. It is\n            suggested that financing arrangements, when multiple\n            co-financiers are involved, should spell out the\n            parties' commitments, nominal fees, and withdrawal\n            penalties, and, be made a condition for negotiations, if\n            possible. When leverage is high, the Bank should front-load\n            the implementation of institutional, and environmental\n            project components, addressing these early on during project\n            execution, and, conditions of effectiveness should be\n            predictable to uncertainties, such as spelling out\n            contracting conditions, to reduce associated
