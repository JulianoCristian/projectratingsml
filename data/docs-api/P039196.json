Rio Grande Do Sul State Reform Loan: the\n            outcome was moderately satisfactory, the sustainability was\n            likely, the institutional development was modest, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the borrower performance\n            was unsatisfactory. Rio the Janeiro State Reform\n            Privatization Loan: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development was\n            modest, the Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            the borrower performance was satisfactory.

The major lessons of general applicability\n            from the five loans assessed include: Continuity of Bank\n            interventions is important for promoting lasting\n            institutional change. Sub-national programmatic loans offer\n            advantages, in this respect, over time-bound State Reform\n            Loan (SRLs). The principles of the Levy Report remain\n            relevant for designing financial sector lending operations.\n            Credit lines (financial intermediary loans) are unlikely to\n            be appropriate instruments for supporting financial sector\n            adjustment. Reconciling project expenditures fully and\n            correctly at closing is a core Bank responsibility. An\n            oversight agency operating within an appropriate regulatory\n            framework is an important prerequisite to successful\n            privatization of public services. As investment loans, the\n            SRLs proved to be cumbersome instruments for supporting\n            structural change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Public Sector Management, Private\n

Some of\n            the key lessons include: 1) Sub-national governments are key\n            elements within the framework of a country's overall\n            reform program. 2) Potential windows of opportunity for\n            reform should be capitalized. 3) For the reforms to be\n            sustainable, a consistent system of incentives has to be in\n            place at the national level. 4) An adequate regulatory\n            framework at the federal level is a pre-requisite for the\n            successful implementation of state-level privatization and\n            concession programs. 5) Focus on those sub-national\n            governments that are most willing and able to implement\n            major reforms. 6) Operations should concentrate on a few,\n            significant reforms that are hard to reverse. 7)\n            Quick-disbursing loans supporting a well-defined set of\n            reforms can be effective tools in promoting structural\n            adjustment at the sub-national level. 8) Reform loans should\n            support the state's own reform program, thus maximizing\n            the state's ownership of the project. 9) Despite the\n            irreversibility of privatization reforms, the project raises\n            the question on whether greater consensus can be achieved\n            with respect to these reforms. 10) The Bank should require\n            the actual sale of public enterprises as a condition for\n            disbursement. 11) Governments should be encouraged to ensure\n            that the composition of the regulatory agencies is\n            politically balanced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rio Grande Do Sul State Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Rio Grande Do Sul

     Grande do Sul (RGS) State Reform Loan Project was developed\n            in a prior sector study that presented options to address\n            the state's debt crises. The objective of the State\n            Reform Project is to improve efficiency in the\n            government's service delivery through privatization and\n            to improve the state's fiscal condition. The project is\n            tailored to support successful implementation of RGS's\n            more limited privatization and fiscal reforms. Its\n            components comprise technical assistance, restructuring of\n            public enterprises that adopt voluntary departure programs,\n            and subprojects and programs to mitigate the reform\n            program's costs, including priority investments and\n            social assistance projects. Selected reforms include actions\n            to privatize the Rio Grande do Sul telecommunications\n            company and the state power company, and to award\n            concessions of water and sewage services, port services, and\n            road maintenance. The environmental targets set for the new\n            utilities will be a critical factor determining both the\n            economic feasibility and the environmental consequences of\n            restructuring; thus, a consistent set of targets and\n            obligations for the restructured utilities will have to be\n            developed early in the process. Other components include\n            reform-related studies, audits, and training; reform-related\n            equipment and rehabilitation works; high priority\n            investments in land management and rural poverty\n            alleviation; highway, school, and hospital rehabilitation;\n            severance pay to employees of reforming state enterprises;\n            and transfers and non-transfers to municipalities and\n            private institutions (to cushion the reform's impact)\n            for incremental, recurrent expenditures in early childhood,\n            public health, sanitation, and basic education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rio Grande do Sul State Reform Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Rio Grande do Sul State\n
