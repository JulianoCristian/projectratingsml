Relations\n            between the Office Militare National pour les Industries\n            Strategiques (OMNIS), and the Bank were excellent, along\n            with the contribution to the completion of the project in\n            spite of all the necessary amendments to, and reallocations\n            of, the credits. The International Development Association\n            (IDA) made an excellent job in preparing and appraising a\n            project which met all of its objectives. The performance of\n            OMNIS consultants was not always satisfactory during the\n            initial period of the credit. This could be explained by a\n            lack of experience on the part of OMNIS, which was unable to\n            set up an efficient system for supervising and monitoring\n            the consultants. This problem was, however, solved, and\n            consultants hired during the second period were, for the\n            most part, excellent. They also provided extremely good\n            public relations for OMNIS abroad. OMNIS would like to see\n            an improvement in future appraisal and supervision missions\n            by the Bank, Each upgrade should include both the staff\n            responsible for the financial and economic side of the\n            project, and the staff responsible for the technical side.\n            This would make both the preparation of these missions and\n            the implementation of their recommendations more effective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
