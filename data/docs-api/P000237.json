The credit was closed on June\n            12, 1997 at government's request, almost two years\n            before its scheduled closing date of March 31, 1999, and the\n            cumulative undisbursed balance was cancelled effective April\n            15, 1997. The project's objectives were to increase and\n            diversify agricultural exports and induce greater efficiency\n            in agricultural production, processing and marketing, by\n            supporting the governments efforts to privatize publicly\n            held agro-industries and by assisting small private\n            entrepreneurs to establish themselves and develop\n            agri-businesses. The project's overall outcome is\n            highly unsatisfactory. None of the projects objectives were\n            attained, the performance of the Banks was satisfactory, and\n            the performance of the borrower was unsatisfactory. The two\n            important lessons learned from this project are: (1) the\n            need to maintain at all times an open dialogue with\n            government and donors that have an active interest in\n            privatization activities given their own past or ongoing\n            investment programs. In the case of this project, the\n            co-financiers were reluctant to speed up the privatization\n            process, because of their desire to ensure that past large\n            investments in the public enterprises were safeguarded and\n            different sensitivities to a changing socio-political\n            environment. It is important for the Bank to be sensitive to\n            this issue during implementation of a privatization program.\n            (2) Project management has to be in line with project\n            activities. In the case of this project, it was unnecessary\n            to have an implementation unit outside of the technical\n            ministry, because of the very limited work load. Moreover,\n            the duration of the contracts for project managers must be\n            limited to allow for timely evaluation. In the case of the\n            project, the contract was for the duration of the project,\n            with only limited scope for performance evaluation and\n            disciplinary action."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
