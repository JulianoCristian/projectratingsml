Any possible financial risk is mitigated by\n            GOI's commitment to a pricing policy which ensures the\n            continued financial viability of CIL."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Dudhichua Coal Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Dudhichua Coal Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/02/725172/india-dudhichua-coal-project","projn":"IN-Coal - Dudhichua Ste -- P009820","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901061248"},"subsc":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abundant coal,aluminum,balance of\n            payments,Benefit Streams,Coal,coal consumption,Coal\n            Demand,Coal Development,coal exploration,coal imports,coal\n            industry,Coal Market,coal mine,coal mines,coal mining,coal\n            producers,Coal Production,coal reserves,coal resources,Coal\n            Sector,coal supplies,Coal Supply,Coking,colliery,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy consumption,deep mines,domestic\n            coal,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic growth,economies of\n            scale,efficiency of energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity consumption,employment,Energy\n            Consumption,Energy Policy,Energy Production,energy\n            resources,energy source,energy supply,energy\n            utilization,engineering,Engineers,exchange rate,exploration\n            and mining,fuel,Gas,gas exploration,gas exploration and\n            development,Geological Survey,hard coal,heat,heating,Hydro\n            Power,hydro resources,imports,Iron,large-scale\n            mines,lignite,mine development,Mineral\n            Exploration,mines,mining companies,mining operations,mining\n            technologies,Natural Gas,nuclear power,nuclear power\n            generation,Oil,oil companies,oil equivalent,open-pit coal\n            mines,petroleum,petroleum products,power generation,power\n            plants,Primary Energy,Primary Energy Production,primary\n            energy requirements,producers,production costs,recoverable\n            reserves,refineries,Steel,thermal coal,Thermal\n            Power,tools,transport,underground mines,underground mining"},"1":{"cdata!":"abundant coal,aluminum,balance of\n            payments,Benefit Streams,Coal,coal consumption,Coal\n            Demand,Coal Development,coal exploration,coal imports,coal\n            industry,Coal Market,coal mine,coal mines,coal mining,coal\n            producers,Coal Production,coal reserves,coal resources,Coal\n            Sector,coal supplies,Coal Supply,Coking,colliery,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy consumption,deep mines,domestic\n            coal,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic growth,economies of\n            scale,efficiency of energy,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity consumption,employment,Energy\n            Consumption,Energy Policy,Energy Production,energy\n            resources,energy source,energy supply,energy\n            utilization,engineering,Engineers,exchange rate,exploration\n            and mining,fuel,Gas,gas exploration,gas exploration and\n            development,Geological Survey,hard coal,heat,heating,Hydro\n            Power,hydro resources,imports,Iron,large-scale\n            mines,lignite,mine development,Mineral\n            Exploration,mines,mining companies,mining operations,mining\n            technologies,Natural Gas,nuclear power,nuclear power\n            generation,Oil,oil companies,oil equivalent,open-pit coal\n            mines,petroleum,petroleum products,power generation,power\n            plants,Primary Energy,Primary Energy Production,primary\n            energy requirements,producers,production costs,recoverable\n            reserves,refineries,Steel,thermal coal,Thermal\n            Power,tools,transport,underground mines,underground mining"}},"owner":"South Asia Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"4714"},"facets":{}}}
