The\n            extensions that were needed further enabled the achievement\n            of the overall project objectives. Sustainability of the\n            project benefits is likely. The overall performances of both\n            the World Bank and the Borrower were satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include the following: Flexibility is required in\n            project design when operating in an uncertain\n            environment--the scope of mechanical repair of the equipment\n            had to be considerably altered during implementation to full\n            rehabilitation in view of the findings based on detailed\n            equipment inspection. Building local capacity through an\n            extended support of technical specialists is critical to\n            sustain the reform program. When new management systems are\n            being introduced, it is useful to build in a long-term\n            service contract to the original contract design. Inability\n            to fully use the stores management database occurred as a\n            result of a lack of supplier support after expiry of the\n            initial contract. policy reforms and capacity building\n            interventions should be accompanied by investment operations\n            to ensure continued leverage in long-term application of the\n            reform agenda. In the procurement of proprietary spare\n            parts, there were no competitive benefits obtained through\n            International Shopping."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea - Road Sector
