The\n            project achieved its principal objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been substantial,\n            sustainability is uncertain at this time, and both the Bank\n            and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can\n            be learned from this project. First, the estimate of the\n            time required for implementation was overly optimistic.\n            Second, the difficult problems associated with land\n            acquisition for the Gujjapura component, and to a lesser\n            extent, the solid waste management component, were not fully\n            appreciated at appraisal. Third, there is a need for a\n            strategy for land acquisition as the lack of one caused\n            major delays. Fourth, urban projects involving multi-agency\n            execution should include a mechanism for integrated project\n            monitoring, coordination, and evaluation. Fifth, the delays\n            with Gujjapura contrasted sharply with the timely benefits\n            provided under the Walled City upgrade. Future projects\n            should concentrate on area upgrading rather than on sites\n            and services. Lastly, the use of integrated area-based\n            packages for basic service civil works contracts should be\n            carefully reviewed in the context of locally available\n            contractor expertise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Lahore Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Lahore Urban\n            Development
