The\n            project is the least-cost solution for the transmission and\n            distribution of electricity for meeting forecast demand;\n            improvement in the reliability of electricity supply and\n            reduction in system losses as well as increased efficiency\n            in the operation of CEB."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius - Power Transmission Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritius - Power Transmission Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/03/727035/mauritius-power-transmission-project","projn":"MU-Power Ii-266999 -- P001889","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Business in Development,Business Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Mauritius","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912291328"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting\n            procedures,Accounts,accounts\n            receivable,acquisition,alternative energy,alternative energy\n            resources,auditing,auditors,Billing,bills,boilers,budgeting,coal,commercial\n            energy,Construction,contractors,cost control,Cost\n            Estimates,covers,diesel engines,diesel\n            fuel,disasters,Economic Analysis,Economic\n            Development,efficient use,electric capacity,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            generation,electricity production,energy consumption,energy\n            crisis,Energy Demand,Energy Policy,energy production,Energy\n            Resources,Engineering,ENGINEERS,exchange rate,financial\n            planning,fire,fossil fuel,fossil fuel resources,Fuel,fuel\n            consumption,fuel oil,FUELS,heat,heating,heavy fuel\n            oil,hydroelectric power,hydroelectric power\n            plants,imports,Income,Insurance,irrigation,offshore\n            oil,offshore oil exploration,oil\n            consumption,overhead,petroleum,petroleum gas,petroleum\n            products,power plants,power stations,Procurement,production\n            costs,rainfall,refined oil,reservoirs,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,Sales,selling,thermal power,thermal power\n            plants,unskilled workers,urban centers,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting\n            procedures,Accounts,accounts\n            receivable,acquisition,alternative energy,alternative energy\n            resources,auditing,auditors,Billing,bills,boilers,budgeting,coal,commercial\n            energy,Construction,contractors,cost control,Cost\n            Estimates,covers,diesel engines,diesel\n            fuel,disasters,Economic Analysis,Economic\n            Development,efficient use,electric capacity,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            generation,electricity production,energy consumption,energy\n            crisis,Energy Demand,Energy Policy,energy production,Energy\n            Resources,Engineering,ENGINEERS,exchange rate,financial\n            planning,fire,fossil fuel,fossil fuel resources,Fuel,fuel\n            consumption,fuel oil,FUELS,heat,heating,heavy fuel\n            oil,hydroelectric power,hydroelectric power\n            plants,imports,Income,Insurance,irrigation,offshore\n            oil,offshore oil exploration,oil\n            consumption,overhead,petroleum,petroleum gas,petroleum\n            products,power plants,power stations,Procurement,production\n            costs,rainfall,refined oil,reservoirs,rivers,Rural\n            Electrification,Sales,selling,thermal power,thermal power\n            plants,unskilled workers,urban centers,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Anchor: MG/MU/KM/SC (AFCMG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"1770"},"facets":{}}}
