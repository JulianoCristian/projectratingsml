Some\n            lessons learned included: during difficult times and when\n            there is limited implementation capacity it is important to\n            keep the design of a project simple even if the project is\n            smaller. This project was too complex with multiple\n            implementing agencies. Given the limited experience with\n            financial sector operations in the Dominican Republic the\n            FSTAL should have been structured as a simple project with\n            clean implementation arrangements or alternatively with a\n            longer execution period and a phased approach, in which\n            triggers will be established for each phase of\n            implementation. If successful, a follow up operation or\n            phases of a longer duration project could have maintained\n            the continuity of institutional support while being more\n            responsive to changing technical assistance (TA) needs over\n            time. The best indicator of project sustainability is\n            borrower engagement in follow-up operations. The FSTAL tried\n            to address too many challenges in the financial system but\n            it should have been more selective particularly with the\n            high degree of uncertainty at the time of project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Financial Sector\n            Technical Assistance Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominican Republic -

capacity of\n            the monetary authorities to improve the design and\n            implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. The project\n            has the following ten components. Component 1) the Central\n            Bank has generated an important quasi-fiscal deficit as a\n            result of the banking crisis management. Component 2) focus\n            on the areas of IT auditing function, external audits\n            accountability, institutional strengthening, implementation\n            of risk-focused supervision and full implementation of the\n            off-site manual. Component 3) seeks to support a gradual\n            development of the market through two major elements\n            focusing on securities markets, and government debt\n            management and fixed income markets. Component 4) will\n            include review and update of the legislation; implementation\n            of risk-based supervision; procurement of IT systems.\n            Component 5) focuses on five areas where institutional\n            capacity would be needed in the medium term: strategic\n            planning, institutional development, human resource and IT\n            and implementation; establishment of appropriate technical\n            and regulatory framework for survivor and disability\n            benefits; investment policy advice on appropriate\n            regulations and linkages to other capital market reforms;\n            training of supervisory staff and; creation of database and\n            production of periodic reports in coordination with other\n            agencies. Component 6) will support a comprehensive reform\n            of the payments system, including the launch of safer and\n            more efficient systems and an improved legal and oversight\n            framework.
