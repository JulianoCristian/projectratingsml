The Xiaolangdi project (stages I and\n            II) is the largest Bank-financed project in China to date.\n            On the international scale, it was a very challenging\n            project because of its huge size, predominantly large\n            underground caverns, high degree of technical difficulties,\n            and complex subsurface conditions. Principal lessons learned\n            from the Project include the following: a) High risk/high\n            reward projects can be effectively implemented with the\n            right skills on the Bank side, and high commitment by the\n            client to good organization and competent management,\n            combined with the judicious use of international technical\n            assistance and review. b) Implementing a project of the\n            magnitude and complexity of Xiaolangdi will be greatly\n            assisted if the implementation organization is in place\n            prior to the start of the project. It should be independent,\n            have full decision-making authority and be accountable and\n            responsibility for implementation performance. c) The\n            separation of the large and complex technical and civil\n            works construction activities from large resettlement\n            activities into two separate project operations worked very\n            well and contributed to the effective and successful\n            implementation of both. It allowed both the Bank and the\n            implementation agencies to concentrate their resources and\n            efforts on the two activities, as separate operations. This\n            provides valuable lessons for the Bank on how to manage\n            large-scale resettlement associated with a major\n            infrastructure investment. d) The establishment and\n            maintenance of effective forum for communications amongst\n            various parties (owner, engineer, designer, advisors and\n            contractors) should be actively pursued from the onset, to\n            avoid misunderstandings that could cause delays and /or\n            losses to the project. Communication difficulties were\n            perhaps the most difficult to resolve in construction of the\n            Xiaolangdi scheme. e) The use of the International Panel of\n            Experts substantially reduced the time for resolving\n            conflicts in understanding technical problems. (f)\n            Experience suggests that an International Panel of Experts\n            for environmental management was necessary to ensure\n            successful implementation of EMP, especially for large-scale\n            projects with significant environmental management risk. g)\n            The use of the Environment Supervising Engineer and\n            International Environmental Panel clearly demonstrated that\n            all environmental issues were observed early and corrective\n            actions were taken. h) The use of Disputes Review Board to\n            resolved claims issues proved to be extremely useful and\n            resulted in most claims being expeditiously resolved. i)\n            Training of staff on all aspects of implementation prior to\n            the start of the project - scheduling, construction\n            supervision, contract management, claims management and cost\n            control averted many of the problems and issues encountered\n            in the project, especially with the international\n            contractor; j) Training of staff prior to completion of the\n            project in financial management, business management and\n            tariff negotiations added significantly the sustainability\n            of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Xiaolangdi Multipurpose\n            (Stage II) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Xiaolangdi\n            Multipurpose (Stage II) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4692137/china-second-xiaolangdi-multipurpose-stage-ii-project","projn":"CN-- Xiaolangdi Multi.

The project's overall plan and\n            its components remain essentially unchanged from that\n            described in the 1993 EA (report no. E30). The XLD project\n            is designed to protect downstream population settlements,\n            farms, and infrastructure from the hazards of disastrous\n            floods; and to achieve a major expansion in downstream\n            irrigation, providing sufficient electric power and water\n            supply to support urbanization/industrialization, to enhance\n            estuarine ecology, and to expand aquaculture. The\n            environmental protection components include the relics\n            protection program; the disease control and protection\n            program; dam stability against earthquake hazards; air,\n            water, and land quality impacts; and impacts on natural\n            vegetation and animals, on rare and commercial species, and\n            on villages around the sites. A detailed archeological\n            exploration, classification, and salvage program has been\n            undertaken to locate, recover, and protect important\n            underground and surface relics and cultural treasures in the\n            area to be inundated. After excavation, objects with value,\n            like earthware, stoneware, etc. will be repaired and stored\n            in museums. The rest, like tomb, ash pit, etc., will be\n            recorded in writing and photographed for further study.\n            According to the evaluation, the main components of objects\n            with historical values will be removed and relocated, if\n            possible, and those which cannot be removed, will be sampled\n            and recorded. A number of serious public health concerns,\n            especially communicable diseases, pose significant problems\n            if protective measures are not taken. The project could\n            significantly increase the hazards of malaria, encephalitis,\n            hemorrhagic fever, and enteric diseases. Measures for\n            control of mosquito vector diseases in the construction zone\n            include: medical screening of all workers; periodic spraying\n            of all buildings in construction work areas and camps; and\n            periodic monitoring of pertinent mosquito species larvae.\n            The hemorrhagic fever control program is based on\n            controlling mice and rat density; and includes medical\n            screening examinations and annual examinations for all\n            construction workers. The mitigation program for enteric and\n            other disease control in the construction zone involves\n            maintaining sanitary conditions in the construction work and\n            living areas, including safe water supply and adequate\n            liquid and solid waste management, and air pollution\n            controls. To address dam safety in the event of earthquakes,\n            a special seismoscopic network is needed to carry out\n            seismic monitoring, allow information feedback, and provide\n            proper earthquake prediction. The assessment determines that\n            either minimally negative or -actually- positive effects\n            will result from the Yellow River's lower flows and\n            less turbid water for the following: freshwater fishery,\n            water quality, land accretion, landslides, reservoir\n            seepage, development of the wetlands, and changes in\n            biodiversity. Reservoir formation will inundate sizable\n            deposits of mineral resources, but the only potentially\n            significant loss would be of coal; however, because the coal\n            lies beneath impermeable shale strata, some mining of it\n            will remain feasible after inundation. Among the number of\n            rare and protected species in the reservoir and in the\n            surrounding area, only waterfowl will be directly affected,\n            their populations possibly increasing. A properly planned\n            flood control system includes not only constructing and\n            operating physical flood control works, but also flood\n            forecasting and an emergency response system. Finally, a\n            detailed resettlement plan is elaborated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Dam Project\n            Stage II : environmental impact assessment (update)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Xiaolangdi Multipurpose\n            Dam Project Stage II : environmental impact assessment\n            (update) (Vol. 2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/02/441310/china-xiaolangdi-multipurpose-dam-project-stage-ii-environmental-impact-assessment-update-vol-2","projn":"CN-- Xiaolangdi Multi.

A detailed archeological\n            exploration, classification, and salvage program has been\n            undertaken to locate, recover, and protect important\n            underground and surface relics and cultural treasures in the\n            area to be inundated. After excavation, objects with value,\n            like earthware, stoneware, etc. will be repaired and stored\n            in museums. The rest, like tomb, ash pit, etc., will be\n            recorded in writing and photographed for further study.\n            According to the evaluation, the main components of objects\n            with historical values will be removed and relocated, if\n            possible, and those which cannot be removed, will be sampled\n            and recorded. A number of serious public health concerns,\n            especially communicable diseases, pose significant problems\n            if protective measures are not taken. The project could\n            significantly increase the hazards of malaria, encephalitis,\n            hemorrhagic fever, and enteric diseases. Measures for\n            control of mosquito vector diseases in the construction zone\n            include: medical screening of all workers; periodic spraying\n            of all buildings in construction work areas and camps; and\n            periodic monitoring of pertinent mosquito species larvae.\n            The hemorrhagic fever control program is based on\n            controlling mice and rat density; and includes medical\n            screening examinations and annual examinations for all\n            construction workers. The mitigation program for enteric and\n            other disease control in the construction zone involves\n            maintaining sanitary conditions in the construction work and\n            living areas, including safe water supply and adequate\n            liquid and solid waste management, and air pollution\n            controls. To address dam safety in the event of earthquakes,\n            a special seismoscopic network is needed to carry out\n            seismic monitoring, allow information feedback, and provide\n            proper earthquake prediction. The assessment determines that\n            either minimally negative or -actually- positive effects\n            will result from the Yellow River's lower flows and\n            less turbid water for the following: freshwater fishery,\n            water quality, land accretion, landslides, reservoir\n            seepage, development of the wetlands, and changes in\n            biodiversity. Reservoir formation will inundate sizable\n            deposits of mineral resources, but the only potentially\n            significant loss would be of coal; however, because the coal\n            lies beneath impermeable shale strata, some mining of it\n            will remain feasible after inundation. Among the number of\n            rare and protected species in the reservoir and in the\n            surrounding area, only waterfowl will be directly affected,\n            their populations possibly increasing. A properly planned\n            flood control system includes not only constructing and\n            operating physical flood control works, but also flood\n            forecasting and an emergency response system. Finally, a\n            detailed resettlement plan is elaborated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Dam Project\n            Stage II : environmental impact assessment (update)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Xiaolangdi Multipurpose\n            Dam Project Stage II : environmental impact assessment (update)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/02/441311/china-xiaolangdi-multipurpose-dam-project-stage-ii-environmental-impact-assessment-update","projn":"CN-- Xiaolangdi Multi.
