Some lessons\n            learned included: given the capacity bottlenecks in the\n            country and the fragile and politically complex\n            post-conflict situation, it is necessary to ensure that a\n            development policy operation is accompanied by appropriately\n            targeted technical assistance to ensure that the commitment\n            and willingness lead to reform results. In this case, the\n            EGRG was supported by Governance and Institutional\n            Development Technical Assistance (TA) Project and a\n            Low-Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) Trust Fund. In such\n            post-conflict situations, it is particularly important to\n            select a focused number of prior actions that are deemed\n            essential to supporting the government's broader reform\n            program. Such selectivity and coordination not only reduces\n            the transaction costs for the government that is burdened by\n            multiple management demands while the capacity is weak, but\n            it also increases the likelihood that such focused actions\n            are implemented and the reform program is moved forward.\n            Given the risks and complexity of this operation in the\n            country's context, close coordination with other\n            development partners has been indispensable to mitigate\n            risks, realize synergies, and improve the leverage in the\n            policy dialogue. Collaboration with the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF) was particularly important."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Implementation\n            Completion and Result Report on the

Given the\n            complex post-conflict environment and governance and\n            transparency issues facing the government, this second\n            objective is pursued by supporting government-owned reforms\n            to improve governance, transparency and efficiency in public\n            expenditure management as well as advance structural reforms\n            aimed at strengthening governance and transparency in the\n            key sectors of the economy (energy, cocoa and financial\n            sector). The Government recognizes the crucial importance of\n            economic governance and transparency and is committed to\n            implement policy reforms to strengthen fiscal\n            sustainability, improve private sector confidence and\n            enhance transparency of state institutions and processes --\n            critical elements for the country's economic and social\n            recovery and for stability and stronger growth in the sub-region."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -
