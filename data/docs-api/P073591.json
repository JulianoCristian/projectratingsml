Lessons learned include: The Bank should stay\n            continuously engaged during critical periods to help sustain\n            ongoing reforms and protect previous achievements. Within a\n            difficult lending and operational environment, focusing on\n            the consolidation of ongoing reforms was an effective\n            strategy. Past institutional relationships matter,\n            particularly during periods of crisis. It is difficult to\n            advance significant social protection reforms during times\n            of extreme fiscal crises. Crises do not always offer windows\n            of opportunities for new reforms. Information technology can\n            effectively improve public management. While SAL operations\n            can be effective tools in establishing the legal framework\n            for the exchange of information across different agencies,\n            they have to be complemented with strong political support\n            from top authorities to successfully overcome institutional\n            resistance and adequate consensus building mechanisms. Loan\n            conditionality should focus on results, and go beyond the\n            enactment of legislation or executive decrees. Overly\n            complex operations are difficult to implement and supervise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina -

within a coherent medium-term\n            framework over the 2001-2003 period. Loan objectives are to\n            improve the quality, equity, and efficiency of social\n            services and to reduce fiscal instability in the\n            federal-provincial public sector. Such reforms are needed to\n            secure sustainability of the economy. Expected benefits\n            include: 1) improved fiscal stability across levels of\n            gocvernment; 2) improved stability in the level of social\n            services provided by the public sector especially those\n            targeted to the poor; 3) improved efficiency, equity, and\n            quality of health insurance services; 4) improved\n            effectiveness of federal and provincial social protection\n            programs in reaching the poor; 5) improved equity and\n            financial sustainability of the national public pension\n            system; and 6) improved efficiency of tax administration.\n            One or two follow-up adjustment operations are planned\n            within the medium-term framework, depending upon progress in\n            implementing the continuing reform agenda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Structural Adjustment\n
