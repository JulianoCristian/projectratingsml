The first focuses on remedying a\n            production shortage by providing new and genetically\n            superior purebred dairy stock, often imported. The second\n            (the operation flood model) involves provision of a reliable\n            market for existing producers. There is overlap in these\n            designs in that both provide for milk processing. The first\n            model includes milk collection, but primarily from its\n            'own' farmers, and the second model includes\n            access to inputs, veterinary services, and crossbred cattle.\n            Despite this overlap, the models are clearly distinct. Only\n            in the case of Turkey was the production strategy\n            unambiguously successful. The Zambian project is of\n            particular interest, since it was designed as a\n            'production' project but implemented as a\n            'marketing' project. The project was appraised on\n            the assumption that crossbred cattle could be freely\n            imported from Zimbabwe. However, the 1980-81 droughts led to\n            a ban on cattle exports from Zimbabwe, and transport costs\n            made it uneconomic to purchase cattle from further a field.\n            This led to a redesign and sharp contraction of the milk\n            production component. Nevertheless, milk collections\n            exceeded the original projections, about half of them from\n            existing small producers. At audit, the five projects that\n            are the subject of this impact evaluation were considered satisfactory."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Karnataka and Rajasthan Dairy\n            Development Projects and the Madhya Pradesh, and First and\n            Second National Dairy Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Karnataka and Rajasthan\n            Dairy Development Projects and the Madhya Pradesh, and First\n            and Second National Dairy Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/441906/india-karnataka-rajasthan-dairy-development-projects-madhya-pradesh-first-second-national-dairy-projects","projn":"IN-Agr.Cr.

the Second National Dairy Project were to\n            promote the establishment of viable cooperative businesses\n            owned and managed by producers, for collecting, processing\n            and marketing milk products in order to expand rural incomes\n            and improve milch animal productivity. These were to be\n            achieved by: (a) expanding and consolidating the integrated\n            cooperative institutional structures; (b) providing the\n            necessary prerequisites for milk productivity enhancement;\n            (c) establishment and expansion of milk collection,\n            processing, storage and distribution activities; and (d)\n            strengthening institutions and training. Some main lesson\n            learnt are:  An understanding of the proper role of\n            government in project implementation is crucial. Project\n            design should explicitly take this role into account.  The\n            AMUL model, a successful experience in milk collection,\n            processing and marketing, controlled and directed by farmers\n            in Gujarat, was considered feasible for replication in other\n            states which had different cooperative traditions and\n            culture. In a sheltered industry, promotion of competition\n            is essential to enhance operating efficiency.  In NDP-II,\n            the quality of management was perceived as a principal risk,\n            thus requiring special attention. However, the Government\n            must also make a contribution to the agency which would be\n            responsible for maintaining quality standards for\n            technically guiding the industry, and for ensuring that good\n            manufacturing practices are applied throughout the dairy\n            industry.  For a project of the size and scope of NDP-II,\n            the Bank should have insisted on the establishment and\n            monitoring of key performance indicators aimed at providing\n            intermediate assessments of project outcomes and likely impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second National Dairy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second National Dairy
