The project will: improve efficient\n            allocation of resources by improving the intermediation\n            capabilities of the banking sector; increase the stability\n            of the banking sector, which will lead to greater\n            mobilization of funds; increase long-term investment by\n            providing critically needed long-term funds to the\n            enterprise

   banking sector and increase the availability of investment\n            financing to the enterprise sector. The project will consist\n            of three components: 1) a commercial bank development\n            component, including long-term funding and technical\n            assistance; 2) assistance to the North Estonian Bank (NEB)\n            and 3) technical assistance to assist in project\n            implementation. The project will: improve efficient\n            allocation of resources by improving the intermediation\n            capabilities of the banking sector; increase the stability\n            of the banking sector, which will lead to greater\n            mobilization of funds; increase long-term investment by\n            providing critically needed long-term funds to the\n            enterprise sector which will in turn improve the\n            productivity of private enterprises by providing technology\n            and capital goods; and provide an incentive for\n            privatization by targeting investment funding toward private companies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Estonia - Financial Institutions Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Estonia - Financial Institutions\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/09/732858/estonia-financial-institutions-development-project","projn":"EE-Financial Institutio -- P008401","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Infrastructure Finance,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring","teratopic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","count":"Estonia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961006163346"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Infrastructure Economics and Finance","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,allocation of resources,asset\n            management,audits,bank assets,bank audits,Bank Group,Bank\n            lending,Bank loan,Bank Loans,banking crisis,banking\n            sector,banking system,capital,capital\n            base,capitalization,commercial bank,commercial bank\n            deposits,commercial banking,commercial banks,Competitive\n            Bidding,demand deposits,depositors,deposits,domestic\n            credit,Economic Rate of Return,Financial\n            Institutions,financial policies,financial\n            resources,financial sector,financing plan,Fiscal\n            Year,GDP,Gross Domestic Product,inflation,initial public\n            offerings,interest rate,international accounting\n            standards,investment,laws,legislation,liquidity,long- term\n            lending,long-term funding,long-term funds,long-term\n            investment,long-term lending,long-term loans,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,private\n            banks,Privatization,productivity,project\n            finance,recapitalization,Savings,technical assistance"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,allocation of resources,asset\n            management,audits,bank assets,bank audits,Bank Group,Bank\n            lending,Bank loan,Bank Loans,banking crisis,banking\n            sector,banking system,capital,capital\n            base,capitalization,commercial bank,commercial bank\n            deposits,commercial banking,commercial banks,Competitive\n            Bidding,demand deposits,depositors,deposits,domestic\n            credit,Economic Rate of Return,Financial\n            Institutions,financial policies,financial\n            resources,financial sector,financing plan,Fiscal\n            Year,GDP,Gross Domestic Product,inflation,initial public\n            offerings,interest rate,international accounting\n            standards,investment,laws,legislation,liquidity,long- term\n            lending,long-term funding,long-term funds,long-term\n            investment,long-term lending,long-term loans,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,private\n            banks,Privatization,productivity,project\n            finance,recapitalization,Savings,technical assistance"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024516-NORWEGIAN CTF-ESTONIA ENVIRONMENT,TF033872-MOLDOVA - FINANCE,TF033029-ESTONIA - FINANCIAL\n            INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF031102-ESTONIA - FINANCIAL AUDITS,TF020223-FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT,TF020222-FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT","repnb":"P6376"},"facets":{}}}
