However, there\n            are some concerns about the on-going privatization of\n            Bedouin rangelands, which has the potential to be both\n            inequitable, and a constraint to sustainable range\n            management in a highly spatially, and temporally variable,\n            low rainfall environment. The experience of this project\n            confirms several familiar lessons: Participatory approaches\n            require an initial phase-in period of skills development,\n            and community interaction, even more so if involving women\n            in a highly traditional society. While independent project\n            units aim at immediate implementation benefits in a\n            slow-moving bureaucracy, even bearing the burden of\n            subsequent costs in terms of sustainability (though possibly\n            justified initially in a pilot demonstration), such a pilot\n            however, still leaves the longer-term institutional\n            questions unanswered, with institutional sustainability\n            remaining at the heart of the development process.\n            Notwithstanding, addressing shorter-term welfare, and\n            poverty is an important precondition, ultimately, for\n            addressing longer-term natural resource sustainability.\n            Finally, despite the potential of participatory development\n            processes at village levels to improve public services, yet,\n            coordination difficulties between programs, often limit such\n            processes to only one program, which is neither

- Matruh Resource Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Matruh Resource Management Project\n            (MRMP) for Egypt had a satisfactory outcome, with likely\n            sustainability, substantial institutional development\n            impact, and satisfactory performances by both the Bank and\n            Borrower.  Lessons were learned in the areas of overall\n            design and participatory approaches and technical or\n            institutional items.  A multi-sectoral/multi-disciplinary\n            approach in natural resource management and poverty\n            alleviation projects is more likely to achieve objectives\n            and should be a first step towards decentralization and\n            local level institutional integration.  Participatory\n            project implementation requires flexible budgeting\n            unconstrained by predetermined outputs, relying on\n            demand-driven identification of activities, to be fully\n            responsive to beneficiary demands, coupled with a change in\n            monitoring and evaluation.  Adequate initial training and\n            capacity building is a prerequisite to activities requiring\n            beneficiary participation.  Rural credit programs require\n            mechanisms that adapt to constraints of both the financial\n            institutions and the beneficiaries and identify a process to\n            bring the two parties into a situation of mutual trust.  The\n            failure to address problems of collateral, religious views\n            to interest rate payment and need for credit delivery at\n            lowest levels will likely lead to failure and eventual\n            component cancellation.  Targeting the poorest segments of\n            the society can be a challenging process where communities\n            have strong traditional structures, and requires time, clear\n            monitoring mechanisms. and strong engagement with the tribal\n            organization.  Accurate unit cost estimation of\n            infrastructure sub-projects is a prerequisite to\n            implementation.  Community rangeland management may have a\n            higher chance of long-term sustainability through ownership,\n            although requiring greater initial time investment.  The\n            project control unit as an add-on and temporary structure\n            for service provision should be critically evaluated when\n            embarking on new development initiatives.  Many of the\n            lessons learned have been incorporated into the second MRMP."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Matruh Resource Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt -

The main purpose of the project is to\n            break the cycle of natural resource degradation and poverty\n            by providing support for improved natural resource\n            management approaches and practices, coupled with\n            agricultural development.  The project is designed to assist\n            the population in making the best use of the limited natural\n            resources available.  The project consists of four\n            components.  The first component is natural resource\n            management which aims to conserve the water, land and\n            vegetation in the area. This component focuses on the\n            effective utilization of surface water flow, through\n            watershed management on about 6000 feddans (2520 ha) and\n            water harvesting, and on the management and sustainable use\n            of land and vegetative cover by the local population and\n            their small livestock.  A second component is adaptive\n            research and extension which focuses on dryland farming and\n            livestock production systems, range management, sustainable\n            agricultural development and training directed to local\n            communities.  A third component is rural finance which gives\n            special attention to the promotion of on-farm and off-farm\n            income-generating activities targeted to small farmers, the\n            landless and rural women. Lastly, a project coordination\n            unit component, aims at strenghtening community\n            participation and the dialogue with existing local institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Matruh Resource Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Matruh Resource\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/05/733131/egypt-matruh-resource-management-project","projn":"EG-Matruh Resource Management -- P005153","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961004064506"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Micro- and SME finance,Agricultural extension and research,Water supply,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            lands,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,climate,commodities,Community\n            Action,community participation,cotton,Crop\n            Yields,Cropping,crops,desertification,Development\n            Projects,DRAINAGE,Economic Analysis,economic\n            development,economic growth,Economic Rate of\n            Return,employment,environmental impact,environmental\n            resources,equipment,exchange rate,exports,extension\n            services,farmers,farming,fertilizers,Fish,GDP,GNP,Gross\n            Domestic Product,Gross National Product,growth\n            rate,income,incomes,Integrated Pest Management,interest\n            rates,intervention,irrigation,labor force,Land\n            Reclamation,land resources,Livestock,"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            lands,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,climate,commodities,Community\n            Action,community participation,cotton,Crop\n            Yields,Cropping,crops,desertification,Development\n            Projects,DRAINAGE,Economic Analysis,economic\n            development,economic growth,Economic Rate of\n            Return,employment,environmental impact,environmental\n            resources,equipment,exchange rate,exports,extension\n            services,farmers,farming,fertilizers,Fish,GDP,GNP,Gross\n            Domestic Product,Gross National Product,growth\n            rate,income,incomes,Integrated Pest Management,interest\n            rates,intervention,irrigation,labor force,Land\n            Reclamation,land resources,Livestock,"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"P6012"},"facets":{}}}
