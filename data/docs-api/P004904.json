This\n            Project was approved by the Board on June 29, 1988. The\n            loan, to assist in the financial strengthening and\n            institutional restructuring of the public power utility,\n            SONELGAZ, was part of the Bank's strategy to support\n            Algeria's far-reaching program of public enterprise\n            reform, to improve the efficiency and viability of these\n            corporations. The project was designed to increase\n            SONELGAZ' capacity to implement the major investments\n            needed to meet increasing demand by optimizing energy\n            production and improving the quality of supply. The\n            longer-term goal was to use the reform of SONELGAZ as a\n            model for the reform of the country's other public\n            enterprises. The main objectives of the project were to: (a)\n            restructure and strengthen the financial position of\n            SONELGAZ, (b) gradually increase SONELGAZ' autonomy,\n            (c) help implement major investments that would help\n            optimize the productivity of the overall power system, (d)\n            improve the quality of the power supply and (e) improve\n            SONELGAZ's' management, planning and engineering capabilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Third Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Third Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/12/731773/algeria-third-power-project","projn":"DZ-Power Iii -- P004904","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980217141328"},"subsc":"Power,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounting\n            systems,accounts,accounts receivable,allocation of\n            resources,audits,autonomy,Bank Performance,Billing,Cash\n            Management,central planning,currency devaluations,debt,debt\n            management,debt service,decision making,Economic\n            Development,economic performance,economic\n            reforms,electricity,electricity generation,enabling\n            environment,expenditures,financial data,financial\n            management,financial management systems,financial\n            performance,Financial performance indicators,financial\n            planning,financial restructuring,financial\n            structure,financial system,financial systems,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,guidelines,income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,internal cash generation,LRMC,Marginal Cost,Mines,net\n            assets,oil,Operating ratio,power plants,private\n            sector,procurement,productivity,public enterprises,public\n            sector,quality of service,reorganization,resource\n            allocation,sales,Savings,Structural Adjustment,technical assistance,telecommunications,utilities,volatility"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounting\n            systems,accounts,accounts receivable,allocation of\n            resources,audits,autonomy,Bank Performance,Billing,Cash\n            Management,central planning,currency devaluations,debt,debt\n            management,debt service,decision making,Economic\n            Development,economic performance,economic\n            reforms,electricity,electricity generation,enabling\n            environment,expenditures,financial data,financial\n            management,financial management systems,financial\n            performance,Financial performance indicators,financial\n            planning,financial restructuring,financial\n            structure,financial system,financial systems,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,guidelines,income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,internal cash generation,LRMC,Marginal Cost,Mines,net\n            assets,oil,Operating ratio,power plants,private\n            sector,procurement,productivity,public enterprises,public\n            sector,quality of service,reorganization,resource\n            allocation,sales,Savings,Structural Adjustment,technical assistance,telecommunications,utilities,volatility"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
