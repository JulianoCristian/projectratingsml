Nutrition Enhancement Project II"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Senegal Nutrition Enhancement\n            Project II received a satisfactory outcome rating with\n            moderate risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower received satisfactory performance ratings. The\n            project was restructured four times. The first time was in\n            2008 to reallocate project funds within the project. About\n            15 percent of the International Development Association\n            (IDA) credit planned for purchase of pharmaceutical products\n            and unallocated funds were reallocated to strengthen the\n            community-based nutrition scale up (Component 1). The second\n            restructuring, again for a reallocation of project funds,\n            was conducted in 2011. The third restructuring was conducted\n            in 2012 when an additional financing from IDA resources\n            became available in March 2012. An extension of the project\n            closing date by 13 months was approved. This additional\n            financing and project extension made it possible to add a\n            fifth PDO and adjust targets upwards that had already been\n            achieved before time. New indicators to strengthen the\n            response mechanisms for the protection of nutrition among\n            vulnerable groups were also added and they reflected a\n            stronger focus on: (i) anemia prevention; and (ii)\n            multi-sectoral approaches at community level to reduce\n            vulnerability to external shocks. The following lessons were\n            gained from this project: (1) A shift in the nutrition\n            discourse to move beyond emergency aid and therapeutic care\n            of malnutrition into the objectives of poverty reduction and\n            development is significant in establishing and sustaining\n            partnerships with Local Governments and sectors infrequently\n            engaging with health and nutrition. (2) The onset of\n            different crises with serious economic consequences\n            demonstrates the need to enhance household and community\n            resilience. (3) Ten years of collaboration between the\n            Government of Senegal and the Bank can improve\n            sustainability of nutrition policy development. (4) Strong\n            national leadership is fundamental to break the invisibility\n            of nutrition and the fragmentation in the discourse\n            surrounding it. (5) Fostering formal partnerships between\n            Local Government, civil society, private sector and sector\n            ministries at the operational level can contribute to the\n            reduction of malnutrition. (6) CEA\u0092s characteristic of being\n            flexible in producing innovative and inclusive forms of\n            community mobilization is essential in gradually turning\n            over the leadership to the local governments. (7) The\n            subsidiarity principle has contributed to: (i) a lean\n            management structure (and low overhead expenditures); and\n            (ii) the development of local capacity among mothers,\n            village leaders and Local Government. (8) Scaling-up\n            nutrition interventions to reach 70 percent of the target\n            population is possible through a community-based approach.\n            (9) The package of direct nutrition interventions have been\n            effective in reducing chronic malnutrition (linear growth\n            retardation), but has done little in making a difference in\n            the rate of acute malnutrition. (10) Effective communication\n            for behavioral change and counseling requires specific\n            messages on the promoted behaviors that build on positive examples."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Nutrition Enhancement Project II"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Nutrition Enhancement\n            Project

The\n            reallocation of the credit proceeds is needed to enhance\n            project effectiveness by ensuring funding for the\n            program's central component on sub-grants for community\n            nutrition sub-projects.
