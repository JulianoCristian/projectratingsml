The following are some lessons\n            of experience. While strong ownership was demonstrated early\n            on, demonstrated by the implementation of major reforms,\n            commitments however, particularly to the sector financial\n            health, waned as the project progressed, resulting in an\n            incomplete reform program. Tariff reform must recognize\n            political economy realities, and must incorporate a\n            sensible, financeable transition subsidy scheme so that full\n            cost recovery, and therefore sustainability of\n            restructuring, can be achieved. Furthermore, reforms need to\n            be institutionalized, putting a burden on capacity building\n            for successor operating entities, and new agencies like the\n            regulatory commission. Regulatory effectiveness is critical,\n            as is independence - in analysis, funding, decision-making -\n            important in building legitimacy among stakeholders. Power\n            sector reforms have important links to broader state fiscal\n            policy initiatives, and each should support the other, while\n            investment programs need to be well prepared and implemented\n            in a way that integrates good financial, and contractor\n            management with social and environmental safeguards."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Orissa Power Sector\n            Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5527284/india-orissa-power-sector-restructuring-project","projn":"IN-Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project\n            -- P035170","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Business in Development,Power & Energy Conversion","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050103121456"},"subsc":"Power,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"audits, average costs, Bank management, Bank\n            Performance, Bank ratings, Bank supervision, best practice,\n            Cancellation, cash generation, clearance, coal, competition\n            policy, conservation, consumer surplus, consumers,\n            corruption, Counterpart, counterpart funds, CURRENCY, Debt,\n            development, dividends, Economic Analysis, economic\n            benefits, Economic Rate of Return, environmental health,\n            environmental management, financial condition, financial\n            costs, financial flows, financial management, Financial\n            Performance, Financial rate of return, financial\n            restructuring, financial returns, financial viability,\n            foreign currency, funds flow, households, inefficiency,\n            insurance, insurance companies, investment funds, local\n            currency, low tariffs, management, management contract,\n            management plans, management problems, margins, mis, Natural\n            disasters, operating costs, partial privatization,\n            performance improvement, political economy, Pollution,\n            private sector, probability, procurement, Project Costs,\n            project management, purchases, rationalization, reforms,\n            regulatory framework, Safety, Service quality, shareholders,\n            supervision, Technical Assistance, uncertainty"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020006-ORISSA POWER SECTOR REFORM\n            (RECIPIENT EX.),TF020007-TO BE DELETED.,TF022510-PRIVATE POWER DEVELOPMENT,TF022621-PHRD-SEBS ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT,TF022865-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY POLICY &\n            PROJECT DEV.,TF023485-USDOE-ALTERNATIVE ENERGY ACTIVITIES,TF025214-PHRD-STATE POWER SECTOR RESTRUCT.PROGRAM,TF025404-PHRD-DSM PLANNING IN STATE\n            POWER SECTOR RESTRUCT.

Issues that have been addressed during the\n            conceptual design of the project are: 1) resettlement and\n            rehabilitation; 2) transmission line rights of way and\n            substation site impacts on land use (agriculture, forest\n            areas, wetlands, wildlands); 3) access roads in remote\n            areas, increase in hunting, exploitation of forest\n            resources, induced development due to new access corridors,\n            human settlement and more extensive clearing; 4) clearing\n            (erosion, loss of habitat) and control of vegetation in\n            rights of ways, including mechanical and chemical clearing\n            operations; 5) erosion during construction, and along access\n            roads, substation and transmission tower sites; 6) potential\n            electromagnetic frequency radiation effects, radio noise and\n            television interference; and &) public access to\n            substations, towers and electrocution hazards, proximity to airports."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Orissa State Power Sector\n            Restructuring Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Orissa State Power Sector\n            Restructuring Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/02/697675/india-orissa-state-power-sector-restructuring-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"IN-Orissa Power Sector Restructuring Project\n            -- P035170","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Roads & Highways,Forestry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"India","authors":{"authr":"The World Bank"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970625092142"},"subsc":"Power,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy,(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access\n            roads,accessibility,afforestation,agricultural\n            land,construction,disposal practices,electrical\n            equipment,electricity,electricity conservation,electricity\n            consumption,electricity demand,emissions,end-users,energy\n            audits,energy conservation,energy efficiency,energy\n            savings,engineers,environmental assessment,Environmental\n            impact,environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental management systems,environmental\n            performance,environmental policies,environmental\n            policy,environmental problems,environmental\n            standards,erosion,erosion control,exploitation,Forest,Forest\n            Act,forest areas,Forest Department,forest land,Forest\n            Officer,forest resources,forest roads,hazards,hunting,Land\n            Acquisition,land use,leakage,noise,power distribution,power\n            systems,radiation,radio,rainfall,rights of way,route\n            surveys,routes,runoff,safety,State\n            Forest,structures,technicians,television,terrain,utilities,vegetation,watershed,watershed management,wetlands"},"1":{"cdata!":"Access\n            roads,accessibility,afforestation,agricultural\n            land,construction,disposal practices,electrical\n            equipment,electricity,electricity conservation,electricity\n            consumption,electricity demand,emissions,end-users,energy\n            audits,energy conservation,energy efficiency,energy\n            savings,engineers,environmental assessment,Environmental\n            impact,environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental management systems,environmental\n            performance,environmental policies,environmental\n            policy,environmental problems,environmental\n            standards,erosion,erosion control,exploitation,Forest,Forest\n            Act,forest areas,Forest Department,forest land,Forest\n            Officer,forest resources,forest roads,hazards,hunting,Land\n            Acquisition,land use,leakage,noise,power distribution,power\n            systems,radiation,radio,rainfall,rights of way,route\n            surveys,routes,runoff,safety,State\n            Forest,structures,technicians,television,terrain,utilities,vegetation,watershed,watershed management,wetlands"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF027165-PHRD-POWER SECTOR REFORM (BANK-EXECUTED),TF025404-PHRD-DSM PLANNING IN STATE\n            POWER SECTOR RESTRUCT.
