Regarding the Managil Project, based on the\n            capital cost of construction through stages 1 and 2, and the\n            estimated cost of completion of stages 3 and 4, the direct\n            return on invested capital is at about nine percent, plus a\n            further 3.4 percent from cotton export duty. It is\n            recommended that priority be given to completion of stages 3\n            and 4, and that the Gezira Board be responsible for\n            technical advice, and supervision of the production of other\n            crops as well as cotton.
