The main\n            objective was originally intended to: (a) increase\n            utilization of domestic coal in primary energy generation in\n            accordance with Government policy at that time; (b)\n            reconstruct and rehabilitate 8 coal power stations belonging\n            to Hungarian Power Companies Limited (MVM) and upgrade other\n            MVM power stations, transmission and distribution systems;\n            and (c) improve MVM 's operational efficiency and\n            management. Bank performance can be considered satisfactory.\n            The performance of the Borrower was also satisfactory. The\n            key lessons learned in the project were: (i) more attention\n            should have been given at appraisal to cost comparisons\n            between indigenous coal and alternative energy options,\n            including environmental costs; (ii) it is important to take\n            account of the risks of actual demand turning out to be\n            different from forecasts, and to adjust investment programs\n            promptly to changed demand information; (iii) to avoid\n            procurement delays under international competitive bidding\n            the Bank should provide to new borrowers and beneficiaries\n            detailed information on its procurement guidelines during\n            project preparation; and (iv) financial covenants should be\n            flexible enough to ensure financial soundness of the\n            enterprises through periods of falling as well as increasing demand."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Hungary - Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/11/733333/hungary-power-project","topic":"Power Transmission m1326842 510,Power Systems m1327093 508,Power-Sharing Agreements m1326381 2477,Power Distribution m1325606 1703,Power Systems Planning m1326167 1704,Power Sector Economics m1326387 516,Power Sector Policy and Institutions\n            m1327094 515","projn":"HU-Power I-113820 -- P008456","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Carbon Policy and Trading,Energy Demand","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Environment,Energy","count":"Hungary","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"World!$!517191"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970701165842"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Power Transmission m1326842 510,Power Systems m1327093 508,Power-Sharing Agreements m1326381 2477,Power Distribution m1325606 1703,Power Systems Planning m1326167 1704,Power Sector Economics m1326387 516,Power Sector Policy and Institutions\n            m1327094 515","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"alternative energy,atmospheric\n            pollution,balance of payments,boilers,calculation,changes in\n            demand,coal,coal mine,coal mining,coal prices,coal\n            supplies,cogeneration,debt,decision making,demand for\n            electricity,demand forecast,district heat,district\n            heating,domestic coal,domestic coal industry,domestic\n            energy,economic analysis,electric\n            power,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            demand,electricity generation,electricity price,electricity\n            prices,electricity production,electricity\n            supply,Emission,emissions,energy conservation,energy\n            demand,Energy Diversification,Energy Management,energy\n            policy,energy prices,energy resources,environmental\n            costs,environmental issues,expenditures,fuel,Fuel\n            consumption,fuel cost,gas,Gas Pipeline,gas turbine,gas\n            turbines,heat recovery,heat supply,heating\n            plant,imports,Industrial Energy,inflation,marginal\n            cost,marginal costs,mines,natural gas,nitrogen\n            oxides,nuclear power,oil,oil prices,particulate\n            emissions,Pipeline,policy environment,pollution\n            control,power generation,power plants,power sector,power\n            stations,primary energy,primary energy\n            consumption,Production of Electricity,thermal\n            efficiency,thermal power"}},"owner":"Energy (ECSEG)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"World"},"1":{"geo_region":"World"},"2":{"geo_region":"World"}},"repnb":"16102"},"739827":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1986/04/739827/hungary-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1986/04/739827/hungary-power-project","new_url":"1986/04/739827/hungary-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1986/04/01/000009265_3970625092552/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1986/04/01/000009265_3970625092552/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2697","docdt":"1986-04-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1986-04-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Power Project is a seven-year time\n            slice of the Hungarian Electric Power Trust's (MVMT)\n            1986-94 reconstruction and rehabilitation program.
