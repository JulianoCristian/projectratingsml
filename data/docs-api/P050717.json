The principal lessons\n            learned in the implementation of the project are: i) In\n            preparing complex sector adjustment operations, the Bank\n            should lead with its comparative advantage - bringing to\n            bear strong technical capacity, honed by practical\n            cross-country experience. ii) Political factors and the\n            legislative needs of the client need to be understood at\n            entry, and should be included in the Bank's dialogue\n            with the client. iii) It is important to select an\n            appropriate instrument. Rather than risk delays and failure\n            in the achievement of the program's long term aims, the\n            Bank team chose to negotiate a medium-term reform strategy,\n            and to allocate its reform goals over a series of\n            single-tranche adjustment operations (STOs). This provided\n            the Bank with greater agility in the disbursement, and will\n            enhance the institution's efficiency and leverage in\n            establishing the conditions of the

     of the capitalized system of individual pension accounts,\n            established as part of Uruguay's 1996 pension reform.\n            Pension reform success depends on the level of pension\n            benefits that the capitalization regime can provide its\n            affiliates. Good financial performance by the capitalization\n            regime would only be achieved if the AFAPs (Pension Fund\n            Administrators) are able to invest in relatively high return\n            marketable securities and reduce their operating costs. This\n            loan supports a number of measures to 1) liberalize the\n            investment regime of the AFAPs to allow greater investment\n            in private securities; 2) increase the availability of\n            private securities to match the growth of capitalized\n            pension funds; and 3) create incentives to improve cost\n            consciousness among the AFAPs and
