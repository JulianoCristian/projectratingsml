Some lessons learned included:\n            in such contexts, relevant capacity building and training\n            initiatives tend to get sidelined if they are not built into\n            the project works execution and therefore require special\n            attention in design, finance and implementation. The\n            addition of the telecenters component, though innovative,\n            was arguably a stretch for Palestinian Economic Council for\n            Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR) with its focus on\n            engineering. The development of the telecenters required a\n            different kind of specialize and was taxing on PECDAR's\n            staff and supervision time. Lack of donor participation in\n            funding or other collaboration should be cause for concern.\n            It is understood with the onset of the intifada (Palestinian\n            uprising), many donors retreated to emergency aid. However,\n            with a proliferation of donors, some continuing to work in\n            community development, there should be more assertive\n            efforts to drive a common framework. The role of the\n            community development consultant (CDC) should be reinforced\n            in project preparation, with buy-in from all stakeholders,\n            and the position active

        rehabilitation, and reconstruction, aiming at improving its\n            operational, and maintenance systems, so as to provide basic\n            social, and economic infrastructure services in marginal\n            areas of the West Bank and Gaza. Although the project is\n            expected to improve pollution levels, and thus improve\n            public health risks, this environmental assessment looks at\n            potential adverse effects on the environment as a result of\n            project implementation. Mitigation is as follows. During\n            construction activities will be limited to a daytime\n            schedule, to reduce noise disturbances; traffic signs will\n            be installed to divert traffic as needed; and, speed will be\n            reduced to prevent excessive congestion. During the design\n            stage, proposals will be included to reduce storm water\n            runoff, and potential wastewater contamination, by\n            intercepting runoff through perforated infiltration pits\n            along the road, diverting part of the runoff to tributary\n            sandy roads. Bond evacuation, and cleaning will be performed\n            during the rainy season. During construction, special care\n            will be taken to avoid water breaks on pipes, or house\n            connections, and, a survey of existing facilities prior to\n            construction, should monitor excavation works, while\n            provisions for immediate repair should an emergency occur,\n            will be established. An appropriate water tariff structure\n            will be implemented, followed by an awareness campaign to\n            educate the population on water consumption issues, and\n            conservation aspects as well."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Integrated Community\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - Integrated\n
