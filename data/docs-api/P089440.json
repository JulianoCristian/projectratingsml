Some lessons\n            learned includes: as part of project preparation, more\n            emphasis should be put on assessing institutional capacity\n            and designing arrangements and mitigation measures to carry\n            out resettlement. Urban upgrading projects are best managed\n            by one agency with delegated authority for all activities\n            within the target area. The presence of an effective\n            grievance redress mechanism is critical to improve\n            development impact by minimizing potential impact on\n            beneficiaries especially in cases of resettlement. The\n            construction of resettlement housing should be prioritized\n            in the chronogram of major works and under the control of\n            the implementing agency. Resettlement options should enable\n            choice differentiated resettlement solutions, and open and\n            frequent consultation with affected families is essential.\n            Resettlement activities must be closely linked to the\n            control of new irregular settlements. The Bank's\n            safeguards policy is not always easy to implement in middle\n            income countries that have their own policies which do not\n            necessarily coincide with the Bank's. Although an\n            integrated approach to environmental sanitation is\n            considered good practice, it may be too complex for some\n            clients. The assessment of political economy issues should\n            be a key part of the preparation in complex/integrated\n            development projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Brasilia

The extension is necessary to allow\n            the Federal District Government (GDF) to finalize the main\n            project activities, especially resettlement activities to\n            ensure safeguards compliance, and achieve the expected\n            project development objective (PDO) results. The nine-month\n            extension will allow the GDF to: (a) complete and deliver to\n            the affected families the houses of second phase in Monjolo,\n            as well as the water supply system and the rehabilitation of\n            a small access bridge; (b) complete the construction of\n            remaining resettlement houses in Vila Estrutural, in\n            accordance with the resettlement action plan, and\n            subsequently conclude remaining infrastructure improvement\n            activities in Vila Estrutural, including paving, drainage,\n            water and sewage systems, and public facilities; (c) improve\n            living conditions for scavengers in the Joquei landfill,\n            including the design of a recycling program for public\n            buildings, construction of a recycling facility with\n            equipment purchase and capacity building; (d) continue\n            preparation of key technical studies in support of\n            policymaking; (e) purchase lake cleaning equipment to\n            improve water quality, which is key to achieve the PDO; and\n            (f) conclude the sewage system for Vicente Pires, another\n            key activity to reach the PDO. The extension of the closing\n            date will also facilitate for the Bank team to continue\n            carrying out project supervision and implementation support\n            to the GDF for the remaining activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -
