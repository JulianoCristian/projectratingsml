and budgeting systems; and (ii) supporting general\n            management improvements where the state performs important\n            economic activities.  The first area will be achieved by:\n            (a) strengthening the macroeconomic framework for planning\n            and budgeting, including better management of external debt;\n            (b) improving preparation of the national budget; and (c)\n            putting in place a pilot financial information system and\n            training accounting professionals to use it.  It will\n            further involve; (d) strengthening public investment\n            monitoring; and (e) studying means for a phased reduction of\n            revenue earmarking.  Subactivities within the second area\n            will include:  (a) helping design a new system for\n            monitoring performance of public enterprises; (b) providing\n            direct assistance to key public enterprises (oil, power, and\n            telephone companies) as well as to mining development\n            initiatives; and (c) streamlining procurement and other\n
