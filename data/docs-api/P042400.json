Lessons reinforce the\n            importance of a clear project design and quality at entry,\n            as well as the significance of incorporating lessons from\n            previous reform efforts. Likewise, commitment to, and\n            ownership for the substance of the reforms, was key to the\n            success of the reform program. In view of this, even in a\n            hostile environment of permanent political and security\n            turmoil, coupled with record high levels of unemployment,\n            implementation of the ambitious and thorny reforms is\n            possible, heavily dependent on effective leadership.\n            Moreover, a daily and open dialogue allows counterparts to\n            better understand the reform objectives. and the specific\n            requirements of each of the components. Appropriate\n            technical assistance (TA) greatly enhanced the reform\n            process, provided by most donors in support of the\n            financial, and enterprise sector reforms, and, the\n            Government of Netherlands provided additional direct budget\n            support for reforms. Nevertheless, certain reforms required\n            appropriate social mitigation measures, particularly in\n            dealing with enterprise restructuring, associated with\n            liquidations and labor redundancies. Hence providing\n            appropriate social support programs, namely through the\n            Social Support Project, facilitated labor restructuring,\n            provided severance payments, and fostered labor programs.\n            Notwithstanding successes, the need for further, third wave\n            reforms aimed at improving the overall investment climate,\n            rule of law and governance, became obvious. This translates\n            into an urgent need for reforms in the judiciary, as the\n            deficiencies and deep systemic problems in the judicial\n            sector, undermined the success of the reforms in the\n            financial and enterprise sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Second Financial and Enterprise\n            Sector Adjustment Loan

will support the\n            Government's sector reform program, to accelerate\n            private sector growth, by strengthening the banking system,\n            and improving the quality of bank inter-mediation. In\n            addition, the project will enable an environment for private\n            sector growth, and, resolve, through privatization/financial\n            restructuring, or closure, the losses that preclude\n            enterprises to succeed within the private sector. The\n            project will foster job creation within the private sector,\n            supported by a strong financial system, and, it is expected\n            that the program would lead to a decline in the current\n            levels of nominal, and real interest rates, and to a\n            concomitant increase in domestic savings, and financial\n            sector inter-mediation, which would generate working\n            capital, and investment finance needed for private sector\n            modernization, and expansion. However, there is the\n            potential risk of an eventual weakening of political\n            commitment to resolve large loss-making enterprises; but,\n            the Social Support Project would partially mitigate this\n            risk, by financing severance payments among such\n            enterprises. Weak institutional capacity is another risk\n            which is to be mitigated by accompanying donor funded\n            technical assistance projects, and, the risk of renewed\n
