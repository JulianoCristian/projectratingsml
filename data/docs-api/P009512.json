Lessons learned from the project are: i)\n            land acquisition compensations should be fair and based on\n            market studies of prevailing land values and the land\n            acquisition system itself ought to be carefully planned and\n            the bureaucratic process should be initiated before project\n            appraisal or negotiations; (ii) while the situation has now\n            improved, counterpart funding was initially an issue\n            impeding project implementation. More careful appraisal of\n            expected funding levels should be undertaken to adjust\n            project size to likely budget constraints; (iii) the\n            Operation Status Survey (OSS), conducted on over 250\n            subprojects completed under the 1979 project and this\n            project, indicated that, with the exception of recently\n            completed works, embankments and hydraulic structures are in\n            a state of disrepair due to faulty operation and delayed\n            maintenance. As agreed, Government of Bangladesh (GOB)\n            should take urgent action, using its own funds, to remedy\n            these defects; and (iv) participatory Operation and\n            Maintenance (O&M) practices, demonstrated on a pilot\n            basis under this project, should be introduced on a wider\n            scale. The International Development Association (IDA), GOB\n            and Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) management\n            should improve monitoring of progress of O&M and timely\n            remedies and actions taken to resolve emerging issues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -

Subprojects are to be selected during\n            project implementation in accordance with guidelines agreed\n            during negotiations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Volume one"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Small Scale\n            Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation Project : Volume one"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/12/740374/bangladesh-second-small-scale-flood-control-drainage-irrigation-project-volume-one","projn":"BD-Sm Sc Fcd & Irrig.Ii -- P009512","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Agricultural Research,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water Law","teratopic":"Water Resources,Law and Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Agriculture","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926131503"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Law and Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            policy,Agricultural Production,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,annual rainfall,aquifer,aquifers,Audit\n            Reports,Canadian International Development\n            Agency,canals,capital costs,catchment,catchment\n            areas,CIDA,Coastal areas,collection of\n            water,Construction,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,Drainage,embankments,erosion,farmers,fertilizers,Fisheries,Flood\n            Control,flood protection,flooding,Floods,food\n            production,forestry,Forests,groundwater,groundwater\n            irrigation,groundwater\n            supplies,HYV,inlets,Irrigation,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            development,irrigation systems,Land Development,land\n            use,lands,Livestock,MOA,National Water Plan,operational\n            practices,population\n            growth,programs,pumps,Rice,rivers,runoff,Rural\n            Development,rural employment,saline water intrusion,surface\n            water,UNDP,Water,water charges,water conservation,water\n            control structures,Water Development,water resource,water\n            resources,water schemes,water sector,wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            policy,Agricultural Production,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,annual rainfall,aquifer,aquifers,Audit\n            Reports,Canadian International Development\n            Agency,canals,capital costs,catchment,catchment\n            areas,CIDA,Coastal areas,collection of\n            water,Construction,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,Drainage,embankments,erosion,farmers,fertilizers,Fisheries,Flood\n            Control,flood protection,flooding,Floods,food\n            production,forestry,Forests,groundwater,groundwater\n            irrigation,groundwater\n            supplies,HYV,inlets,Irrigation,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            development,irrigation systems,Land Development,land\n            use,lands,Livestock,MOA,National Water Plan,operational\n            practices,population\n            growth,programs,pumps,Rice,rivers,runoff,Rural\n            Development,rural employment,saline water intrusion,surface\n            water,UNDP,Water,water charges,water conservation,water\n            control structures,Water Development,water resource,water\n            resources,water schemes,water sector,wheat"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"6904"},"facets":{}}}
