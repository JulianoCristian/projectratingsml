They often are of a political economy nature, as\n            well as technical; and both kinds of risks need to be\n            recognized and planned for. In Indonesia, reluctance to\n            introduce accompanying regulations to new laws was an\n            indicator that new institutional arrangements had yet to\n            mature; and that government was not yet ready to firm up its\n            options for defining new responsibilities. Conventional\n            government processes (budget processes, fiduciary controls)\n            should be amenable to adjustment, especially when the\n            emphasis is on piloting new methods. The purpose of piloting\n            is to learn and adapt, which requires some flexibility. All\n            three projects were piloting new complex reforms in an\n            unsettled environment. All three were closely sequenced,\n            offering limited opportunity for transmitting learning from\n            one project to another. Projects introducing new\n            institutions must be seen as opportunities for learning and\n            improving, and sequencing should have that in mind."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, and Third Phase\n            of the Provincial Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -

Some of the lessons learned\n            included: 1) the central government has limited capacity for\n            decentralization and has not adequately adjusted its\n            structure and functions to respond to the needs. In the\n            early days of decentralization in Indonesia expert and\n            policymakers focused on the limited capacity of districts\n            and provinces to assume their new responsibilities. That the\n            central government needed to scale back on its\n            implementation activities and assume new leadership roles\n            was assumed to be a relatively easy transition. But in time\n            the inability of the Ministry of Health (MOH) to restructure\n            and change its mind-set have emerged as major obstacles to\n            effective decentralization of the health system. Future\n            projects need to address or adapt to the weak leadership\n            from the central level; 2) as stated in the Guidelines for\n            the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), project development\n            objectives should focus on the outcome for which the project\n            can be held accountable given the project's duration,\n            resources and approach. Performance indicators (PI) need to\n            be selected more thoughtfully, defined more precisely, and\n            measured much more carefully. If performance indicators with\n            targets must be set, maybe such targets could be conditional\n            given the uncertainty surrounding current changes in\n            governance. Moreover, both Government of Indonesia (GOI) and\n            Bank could have tried to formally revise the indicators\n            during the life of the operation; and 3) while the project\n            gave excellent insights on institutional changes and why\n            those should happen, in many areas it was less specific on\n            the how. While that is part of the flexibility of the\n            design, in many areas the provinces and districts needed\n            some more guidance and lessons from other provinces and\n            countries to learn how best to proceed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Provincial Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Provincial Health Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/06/9736257/indonesia-provincial-health-project","projn":"ID-Provincial Health I -- P049545","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20080805063026"},"theme":"Decentralization,Participation and civic engagement,Other communicable diseases,Injuries and non-communicable diseases,Health system performance","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health,Compulsory health finance","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, accountability mechanisms,\n            accounting, ADB, auditing, auditors, audits, autonomy, Bank\n            Ratings, basic health services, block grants, budget\n            allocation, certification, cities, civil service,\n            communicable diseases, credit approval, Decentralization,\n            district governments, Districts, doctors, expenditures,\n            external auditors, Financial Balance, financial control,\n            Financial Management, Gender, health care accreditation,\n            health care facilities, health centers, Health Data, health\n            expenditure, health expenditures, health facilities, health\n            finance, health financing, health financing scheme, health\n            indicators, Health Information, Health Information System,\n            health information systems, Health Insurance, health\n            insurance coverage, Health Insurance Scheme, health\n            insurance system, health organization, Health Planning,\n            health policies, health policy, health professionals, HEALTH\n            PROJECT, health projects, Health Promotion, health reform,\n            health sector, health sector reform, Health service, health\n            service delivery, health service providers, health service\n            provision, Health service utilization, health services,\n            Health Specialist, Health Strategy, Health system, Health\n            system performance, health-related programs, hospitals,\n            household expenditure, households, HR, Human Development,\n            human resource management, human resources, incentive\n            structures, income, information dissemination, Injuries,\n            integration, internal audits, intervention, interventions,\n            key performance indicators, laws, legal framework,\n            legislation, Local Government, local governments, managed\n            care, Management Reports, Matching Grants, medical\n            equipment, mortality, national civil service, needs\n            assessment, nurses, Nutrition, outpatient care, Pacific\n            Region, pharmacists, PHO, Primary Health Care, private\n            doctors, private sector, provision of services, public\n            health, public sector, quality control, quality of health,\n            Regional Development, regulatory framework, regulatory\n            tasks, reorganization, Resource Mobilization, retirement,\n            Safety, safety nets, Social Development, social research,\n            social safety nets, social welfare, Technical Assistance,\n            work force"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF025116-PHRD-PROVINCIAL HEALTH PROJ.
