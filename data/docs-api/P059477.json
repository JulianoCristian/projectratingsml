Some lessons learned\n            included: having community organizations manage their own\n            water schemes imposed certain challenges in terms of\n            procuring material, consultants, or conducting maintenance\n            works. From the beginning, the project therefore stimulated\n            the formation of district level associations as an extended\n            arm of the local health department. Adopted through\n            participatory approaches, communities determined the level\n            of their tariffs themselves, mainly basing it on purely\n            social considerations. The project's consultants\n            assisted communities with this exercise, but many of them\n            were also no trained economists, and were therefore not able\n            to focus on economically sustainable tariffs. During two\n            years of extensive project preparation, which included\n            hiring a local NGO with experience in community work, WSLIC\n            II was designed by drawing on a range of lessons learned\n            from its predecessors. The decision with the possibly\n            highest impact on the successful implementation of the\n            project was to keep the project responsibility with only one\n            agency, the Ministry of Health. The experience stemmed from\n            the first WSSLIC project, whose project design was set up in\n            a decentralized way, but ultimately resulted in a focus on\n            constructing infrastructure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Water and Sanitation for\n            Low Income Communities Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second Water and\n

As a growing\n            middle-income country, Indonesia needed to substantially\n            increase access to sanitation services. Second Water and\n            Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project, funded by\n            World Bank helped Indonesian communities to create the\n            technical capacity to plan, manage and sustain improved\n            water programs, sanitation, and community health services.\n            It improved hygiene and health behavior, by providing safe\n            options for waste disposal and clean water supply. The\n            project also provided technical assistance to educate local\n            communities about the importance of managing their own water\n            and sanitation in a sustainable way."},"docna":{"cdata!":"From a flow of funds, a flow of water -\n            Improving water sanitation in Indonesia"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"From a flow of funds, a flow of\n            water - Improving water sanitation in Indonesia"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2011/04/25378345/flow-funds-flow-water-improving-water-sanitation-indonesia","count":"Indonesia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"sanitation, communities, water supplies,\n            community sanitation, villages, sanitation services,\n            construction of infrastructure, village level, local\n            communities, service contracts, households, clean water,\n            provision of water, water sanitation, facilities, water,\n            community health, hygiene, water supply, services,\n            sanitation program, water resource, health care, household,\n            community, access to sanitation, health, accessible water\n            supply, project, service delivery, community management,\n            health and hygiene, rural villages, service, districts,\n            sanitation promotion, waste disposal, clean water supply,\n            sanitation facilities, public health"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"A partir de un flujo de fondos, un\n            caudal de agua - Mejora del saneamiento del agua en Indonesia"}},"topic":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199","projn":"ID-Second Water & Sanitation For Low\n            Income Communities Project -- P059477","subtopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Hygiene Promotion and Social Marketing,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0831b0bc1_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!Southeast Asia"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","theme":"Decentralization,Health system performance,Participation and civic engagement,Other human development,Rural services and infrastructure","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water Supply and Sanitation m1327240 1199","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population - GP (GHNDR)","trustfund":"BBGPG-GLOBAL PUBLIC GOODS FUND,TFM23692-Indonesia Water and Sanitation\n            for Low Income Communities Project,TF023692-TECH ASSISTANCE FOR WATER\n            SUPPLY & SANITATION FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIE,TF039529-INDONESIA - 2ND.WATER SUPPLY\n            AND SANIT.
