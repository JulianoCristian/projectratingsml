The main objectives of the project\n            were to: (a) avert a serious risk of failure of several\n            major structures in the upper reach of the Upper Ganga Canal\n            (UGC) system; (b) rehabilitate and modernize the system and\n            use the savings in water supplies to increase the irrigated\n            areas; (c) increase water supply through conjunctive use of\n            groundwater; (d) improve the State's capacity for\n            sectoral planning and overall management of irrigation\n            schemes; (e) enhance the benefits from sunk cost in the\n            Madhya Ganga Canal (MGC) system which interrelates with the\n            UGC system; and (f) maximize crop production and\n            farmers' income in the project area. The performance of\n            the Bank during supervision was mixed since they failed to\n            push the integrated approach of the project.  The main\n            lessons learnt are: (a) As in many other projects in India,\n            part of the reason for partial completion of the project in\n            Uttar Pradesh is due to the allocation of counterpart funds\n            among too many projects. It is essential that the scale of\n            the project be tailored to the availability of financial\n            resources of the government and to match institutional\n            capabilities.It is essential to have proper designs and\n            adequate investigations of major structures available for\n            review during appraisal and in any case prior to\n            negotiations.  There is a need for future projects to\n            resolve the problem of inadequate operation and  maintenance\n            funding and the related issues of level of water charges and\n            collection rates. In-depth monitoring is an essential tool\n            for improving project performance and for providing reliable\n            data for estimation of project benefits. Follow-up surveys\n            should therefore be encouraged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Upper Ganga Irrigation Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Upper Ganga Irrigation\n            Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/733902/india-upper-ganga-irrigation-modernization-project","topic":"Water Quality Standards m1327118 1215,Water Economics m1327707 1998,Irrigation and Drainage Modernization and\n            Rehabilitation m1326422 997,Water m1326522 137,Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566","projn":"IN-Upper Ganga Irrig -- P009813","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Agricultural Research,Water Use,Environmental Economics & Policies,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Water Resources,Agriculture,Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!517212"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019114818"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Agriculture,Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","topicv3":"Water Quality Standards m1327118 1215,Water Economics m1327707 1998,Irrigation and Drainage Modernization and\n            Rehabilitation m1326422 997,Water m1326522 137,Environment and Natural Resources m1327391 566","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acre-feet,agricultural\n            development,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,conjunctive use,conjunctive use of\n            groundwater,construction,cost savings,crop\n            yields,Cropping,crops,distribution of\n            water,drainage,Economic Analysis,economic\n            policies,Electricity,employment,farmers,financial\n            resources,HYV,income,Irrigation,irrigation\n            services,irrigation water,joint implementation,Operation\n            & Maintenance,policy decisions,Present\n            Value,savings,seepage,surface water resources,trees,water\n            charge,water charge system,water charges,Water\n            distribution,water management,water rates,water\n            supplies,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"acre-feet,agricultural\n            development,agricultural extension,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,conjunctive use,conjunctive use of\n            groundwater,construction,cost savings,crop\n            yields,Cropping,crops,distribution of\n            water,drainage,Economic Analysis,economic\n            policies,Electricity,employment,farmers,financial\n            resources,HYV,income,Irrigation,irrigation\n            services,irrigation water,joint implementation,Operation\n            & Maintenance,policy decisions,Present\n            Value,savings,seepage,surface water resources,trees,water\n            charge,water charge system,water charges,Water\n            distribution,water management,water rates,water\n            supplies,water supply"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"14570"},"722783":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/05/722783/india-upper-ganga-irrigation-modernization-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1984/05/722783/india-upper-ganga-irrigation-modernization-project","new_url":"1984/05/722783/india-upper-ganga-irrigation-modernization-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/09/000178830_98101902443111/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/02/09/000178830_98101902443111/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1483","datestored":"2000-02-09T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1984-05-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - Upper Ganga Irrigation\n            Modernization Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Upper Ganga Irrigation Modernization\n            Project comprises a six-year time-slice of a program for\n            rehabilitation and modernization of the Upper Ganga Canal\n            (UGC) System.
