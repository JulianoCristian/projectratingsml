The overall sustainability of\n            the project is unclear due to uncertainties over technical\n            procedures for forest management and mechanization; the\n            impact of adverse input/output values on economic viability\n            of the forest sector; and weak support for national parks\n            development. Five key lessons result: In a country with\n            strong traditions in forestry production, well-trained\n            personnel, a clear development program and implementation\n            capacity, the main benefits are in introducing modern\n            technologies and institution strengthening. Second, forest\n            establishment and management innovations have to be\n            supported by hard evidence of their technical, financial,\n            environmental, and economic advantage. In-depth technical\n            and economic analysis of the comparative advantage of\n            options and alternative project designs is essential. Third\n            commitment must be obtained during the appraisal process on\n            the source of financing. Fourth, the design of institutional\n            development activities should emphasize the need for\n            financial and economic sustainability. Finally, the Bank\n            should pay more attention to ensuring that problems arising\n            during project implementation are thoroughly addressed\n            during supervision, and

- Forest Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall objective of the project is\n            to assist the government in executing its Program of the\n            Development of Selected Forestry Branches and Protection of\n            Ecosystems in National Parks for 1993-1997, thereby ensuring\n            the protection of Poland's forest ecological capital,\n            providing for social benefits, and accommodating sustainable\n            forestry.  The project consists of seven components grouped\n            into four categories.  The first category, environmental\n            forest management, includes activities to increase the\n            vitality of forest stands and their ability to overcome the\n            effects of present and future levels of air pollution and\n            other stress factors.  Funds will be provided for:\n            labor-intensive activities such as tending and thinning;\n            restoration of air pollution damaged forests to protect\n            delicate watersheds and prevent soil erosion; afforestation\n            of land moving out of agriculture; and a genetic\n            conservation and improvement program to ensure the\n            availability of high quality seed.  The second category,\n            modernization of harvesting, skidding and transport\n            equipment, will reduce the negative environmental impact of\n            current practices.  The General Directorate of State Forests\n            (GDSF) will develop a privatization plan for harvesting,\n            skidding, and transportation operations by June 30, 1994.\n            The third category, ecosystem conservation in national\n            parks, includes funding for the core component of a program\n            to conserve Poland's ecosystems located in the national\n            park system.  Management activities within all national\n            parks will follow the plans of national park protection\n            developed as a result of the project.  Finally, the fourth\n            category, institutional development, includes technical\n            support, equipment, and related investments to the GDSF and\n            the Board of Polish National Parks to assist the\n            organizational, management, and financial restructuring of\n            the GDSF.  Funding will also be provided to develop a\n            strategy for environmentally sound forest utilization to\n            balance environmental and economic considerations.  In\n            addition, an information system, including a Geographic\n            Information System integrated with a planning system, will\n            be expanded to improve management through procedures for the\n            strategic and operational planning of forest operations,\n            market information, logistical planning, and administration.\n            A Section for Privatization of Forestry Services will be\n            established, and financial management capabilities, as well\n            as forest research capabilities will also be strengthened."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
