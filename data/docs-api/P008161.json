Sustainability of the project is likely,\n            considering that laws have been approved that will maintain\n            the changes supported by the project. Overall, The World\n            Bank's performance was satisfacotry during project\n            preparation, appraisal, and implementation. The overall\n            performance of the Borrower was satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons lkearned from the project were the following: Strong\n            and continuous government support is required for even the\n            most gradual phasing of health reforms. It is equally\n            important to have flexibility in project design and a clear\n            exit strategy because of the risks of reforms. Communication\n            strategies should be considered from the very beginning when\n            proposed changes are expected to generate significant\n            resistance and opposition from stakeholders. The concept and\n            importance of monitoring and evaluation has to be introduced\n            right from the beginning of the project. Furthermore, it\n            quickly has to be reflected in functional systems being in\n            place. If not, as project implementation advances and the\n            project's cycle shorten, it will become increasingly\n            difficult to correct this weakness. The project demonstrated\n            that, if an innovative pilot program is implemented well and\n            concides with serious government commitment, it is possible\n            to replicate the program in other hospitals and expand its\n            benefits on a sustainable track. A strong working\n            relationship between the central level staff and the PCU\n            advances implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Health Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay -

Given the complexity\n            inherent in health sector reforms and existing institutional\n            constraints, the project focuses on a limited set of key and\n            attainable objectives to lay the foundation for incremental\n            and sustainable improvements. Its aims are twofold: 1)\n            improve the efficiency and quality of services provided to\n            the poor and uninsured by reducing the Public Health\n            Ministry's (MSP) role in the direct provision of health\n            services; and 2) establish the framework for the development\n            of health sector institutions. To address these objectives\n            the project comprises the following components: 1) The\n            delegation of MSP's service delivery responsibilities\n            will support the reduction of the MSP's role in the\n            direct provision of services, promoting the gradual\n            delegation of MSP service provision responsibilities to\n            eligible entities, primarily in the private sector. 2) The\n            insititutional development component will strengthen the\n            sector's institutional capacity and management\n            practices to support the gradual delegation of the\n            MSP's service provision responsibilities. 3) The\n            establishment of health sector disease priorities component\n            will help adjust the health service model to the\n            country's demographic and epidemiological profile. On\n            the basis of global-burden-of-disease and related cost\n            effectiveness analyses, the component will provide selective\n            support to priority

sector spending. Given the complexity\n            inherent in health sector reforms and existing institutional\n            constraints, the project focuses on a limited set of key and\n            attainable objectives to lay the foundation for incremental\n            and sustainable improvements. Its aims are twofold: 1)\n            improve the efficiency and quality of services provided to\n            the poor and uninsured by reducing the Public Health\n            Ministry's (MSP) role in the direct provision of health\n            services; and 2) establish the framework for the development\n            of health sector institutions. To address these objectives\n            the project comprises the following components: 1) The\n            delegation of MSP's service delivery responsibilities\n            will support the reduction of the MSP's role in the\n            direct provision of services, promoting the gradual\n            delegation of MSP service provision responsibilities to\n            eligible entities, primarily in the private sector. 2) The\n            insititutional development component will strengthen the\n            sector's institutional capacity and management\n            practices to support the gradual delegation of the\n            MSP's service provision responsibilities. 3) The\n            establishment of health sector disease priorities component\n            will help adjust the health service model to the\n            country's demographic and epidemiological profile. On\n            the basis of global-burden-of-disease and related cost\n            effectiveness analyses, the component will provide selective\n            support to priority programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Health Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay - Health Sector\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/02/732784/uruguay-health-sector-development-project","projn":"UY-Health Sector Development -- P008161","subtopic":"Health Economics & Finance,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Governance Indicators,Banks & Banking Reform,Poverty Assessment","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Uruguay","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007114845"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency\n            Syndrome,Administrative costs,aging,auditors,audits,Capital\n            markets,cardiovascular\n            diseases,debt,decentralization,economic\n            performance,expenditures,external environment,face\n            value,feasibility study,financial sector,financial sector\n            reforms,Financial Systems,financing mechanisms,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,health care,health\n            interventions,health programs,Health Sector,health\n            service,health services,hospitals,human capital,human\n            resource,Immunodeficiency,Implementing Agency,income,income\n            distribution,income populations,inflation,informal\n            sectors,Institutional Development,institutional\n            reform,Insurance,local government,macroeconomic\n            variables,management capacity,management information\n            systems,media,Natural Resources,Participatory\n            Approach,physicians,policy framework,political\n            commitment,political parties,political stability,Poverty\n            Category,Present Value,primary education,Private\n            Insurance,private sector,privatization,Public Health,public\n            sector,recurrent costs,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,Resource allocation,service\n            delivery,Service provision,Social Security,structural\n            adjustment,technical assistance,Transport,treasury\n            notes,Vocational Training,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency\n            Syndrome,Administrative costs,aging,auditors,audits,Capital\n            markets,cardiovascular\n            diseases,debt,decentralization,economic\n            performance,expenditures,external environment,face\n            value,feasibility study,financial sector,financial sector\n            reforms,Financial Systems,financing mechanisms,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,health care,health\n            interventions,health programs,Health Sector,health\n            service,health services,hospitals,human capital,human\n            resource,Immunodeficiency,Implementing Agency,income,income\n            distribution,income populations,inflation,informal\n            sectors,Institutional Development,institutional\n            reform,Insurance,local government,macroeconomic\n            variables,management capacity,management information\n            systems,media,Natural Resources,Participatory\n            Approach,physicians,policy framework,political\n            commitment,political parties,political stability,Poverty\n            Category,Present Value,primary education,Private\n            Insurance,private sector,privatization,Public Health,public\n            sector,recurrent costs,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,Resource allocation,service\n            delivery,Service provision,Social Security,structural\n            adjustment,technical assistance,Transport,treasury\n            notes,Vocational Training,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P6468"},"facets":{}}}
