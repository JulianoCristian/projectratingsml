Some lessons learned includes: the dual\n            objectives of financial stabilization and market development\n            requires favorable market conditions and tight and direct\n            linkages between what is being financed and what is the\n            desired outcome to be effective. The project might have\n            benefited from a more modest objective of just\n            stabilization, in particular given the market turbulence.\n            Market stabilization can generate important development\n            benefits by preventing negative impacts, particularly during\n            a time of crisis, which commonly hit the lowest-income\n            sectors the hardest. The link between the expenditures\n            financed and the outcomes must be straightforward. Project\n            design should maximize the ability of the project to\n            leverage change. Finally, the instrument used-an investment\n            loan with a fast disbursement component-enabled the Bank to\n            address the specific needs of the Borrower but at the same\n
