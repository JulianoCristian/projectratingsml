of\n            exports and industry as well as strengthening the financial\n            sector. More particularly this program will focus on two key\n            areas. First, the remaining distortions in the trade regime\n            would be eleminated by establishing a broad based and more\n            uniform tarriff structure with appropriate incentives for\n            export. Second, private investment and equity investment\n            bias would be reduced by eliminating distortions in the\n            financial markets. The project would finance imports of raw\n            materials, intermediate goods, non-luxury consumer goods,\n            capital equipment and spare parts. Counterpart funds would\n            be used to reduce the indebtedness of the Government with\n            the domestic banking system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Trade and Financial Sector\n
