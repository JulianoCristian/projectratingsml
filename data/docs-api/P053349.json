Some\n            lessons learned included: flexibility is needed in designing\n            and allocating budgets to project activities to accommodate\n            unanticipated externalities (such as climate change), to\n            respond to new opportunities, and to meet changes in client\n            needs during implementation. Regional data collection and\n            dissemination should be demand-driven to ensure use of\n            information and markets to pay for it. Alternative\n            livelihoods must be introduced in tandem with restrictions\n            on former resource use and closures on new entrants to the\n            sector to reduce pressure on targeted resources. Training in\n            alternative livelihoods must be accompanied by marketing and\n            incubation of new lines of business. The private sector must\n            be involved in setting codes of conduct for sustainable\n            tourism and in generating investments in greener operations,\n            but to engage the industry effectively, regulatory policies\n            must be aligned with economic incentives. Implementing\n            regional projects to protect Tran's boundary public\n            goods is complicated by: (a) processes and institutional\n            arrangements in the Bank that are designed primarily for\n            single-country operations; (b) differences in client country\n            readiness and capacity; and (c) biases that favor national\n            interests over shared regional ones. Overcoming these\n            barriers requires flexibility in administrative processes,\n            innovative financing to access regional financing and\n            educating stakeholders about the benefits of a regional\n            approach through continuous dialogue, consultation, and outreach."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and Caribbean - Conservation\n            and Sustainable

safeguard\n            biodiversity values, and functional integrity; and, create a\n            framework for its sustainable use. The components will: 1)\n            support immediate improvements in marine, and coastal\n            protected areas (MPAs), through planning, management, and\n            monitoring efforts, specifically, through the establishment\n            of a MPA data-baseline, and monitoring programs; the\n            development of management plans for MPAs; supply of basic\n            equipment, and infrastructure for MPA planning; and, a\n            trans-boundary cooperation in policy, protection, and\n            management of MPAs. Capacity building for MPA management\n            will include regional training courses/workshops, namely the\n            Marine Park and Tourism Resource Development Program, and\n            Training Library Development; 2) establish a regional\n            environmental monitoring, and information system (EIS), and,\n            develop a web-based EIS, as tools to organize, and\n            disseminate environmental data on reefs, and ecosystems in\n            the MBRS. Targeted research will support field studies, to\n            include water quality flows, and develop a hydrodynamic\n            surface flow model; 3) promote sustainable fisheries\n            management, through institutional strengthening, and\n            monitoring, and, facilitate sustainable coastal/marine\n            tourism, through policy dialogues, and a cooperative action\n            forum; and, 4) develop public awareness campaigns, provide\n            formal/informal education, supported by the coordination of\n            a regional steering committee, a consultative group, and the\n            program coordination unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and Caribbean -

In order to mitigate\n            potentially negative consequences, this environmental\n            assessment (EA) suggests the following be considered for the\n            construction and operation of the marine protected areas\n            infrastructure: Construction will take place during the dry\n            season to reduce potential for rain and storm-related\n            erosion/sedimentation and contamination. The construction of\n            the siting structures should avoid clearing and/or draining\n            of mangroves or wetland areas. The EA suggests avoiding\n            excavation/dredging or quarrying of coral rocks and sand,\n            especially along coastal headlands, reefs, and seagrass\n            areas. Construction techniques will include silt barriers\n            and berms to control accelerated erosion and sedimentation\n            of nearby wetland, riparian or coastal areas. To avoid\n            contamination of the surrounding environment with liquid and\n            solid wastes caused by the operation of the facilities, a\n            solid waste management plan will be in place at the\n            initiation of construction. Any oil, grease or fuel should\n            be stored in containers and protected from storms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and the Caribbean -\n            Sustainable Use of the Mesoamerican
