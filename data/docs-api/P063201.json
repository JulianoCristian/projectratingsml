Bank post-disaster assistance needs to\n            be rethought in light of the experience not only of this\n            project, but also of other emergency operations which had\n            faced similar problems. Significantly, some of the most\n            successful emergency operations designed in a similar way to\n            this project required several extensions and on average a\n            five year implementation period (against an initial\n            three-year implementation period) to meet its reconstruction\n            and longer-term institutional capacity building objectives.\n            These experiences suggest the following: Emergency Recovery\n            Loans (ERLs) require rapid preparation, smooth\n            implementation, and project objectives that can be achieved\n            in a short period of time. Although the pressure to respond\n            rapidly to a government's request for post-disaster\n            assistance is great, special attention should be paid to\n            flexibility of project design and scope, realism of\n            development objectives and monitoring and evaluation of\n            project outcomes and impact. To the extent possible,\n            emergency assistance should take advantage of available\n            funds in the existing country portfolio. However, the impact\n            of reprogramming of funds on the CAS and the development\n            objectives of the affected projects should be carefully\n            assessed. In general, initial assistance should be focused\n            on repairing / rehabilitating critical social and economic\n            infrastructure. Medium-term objectives of reconstruction and\n            rehabilitation to hazard-resistant standards and longer-term\n            institutional capacity building objectives should, as much\n            as possible, be dealt with through separate means or\n            instruments. Fiduciary requirements -- financial management\n            and procurement -- should be more flexible than in\n            investment operations, particularly in projects with\n            relatively short-term rehabilitation and reconstruction\n            activities. Project Implementation and Supervision: The\n            development effectiveness of emergency operations depends on\n            how fast results are obtained on the ground. The Bank should\n            pay special attention to effectiveness and disbursement\n            conditions since project start up may be slow down if these\n            prove to be too stringent. Once it is clear that project\n            extension is needed to meet development objectives, decision\n            on the length of closing date extension should be made on\n            the basis of actual project needs. Emergency operations that\n            are multi-sectoral and also include mid-or-long-term\n            institutional components demand a larger amount of\n            supervision resources than investment projects and should be\n            budgeted accordingly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Hurricane Georges\n            Emergency Recovery
