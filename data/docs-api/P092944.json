Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) As evidenced by the allocation of expenditures\n            under the Government of Rwanda (GoR's) budget over the\n            period of the first PRSC/G series, the nominal amount\n            allocated to the social sectors and agriculture increased\n            due to the overall increase in public expenditure both in\n            nominal and real terms, accompanied by an increase in GDP\n            over the period. However, the share of the budget allocated\n            to these sectors remained steady or decreased slightly (as\n            in education). 2) The infrastructure sub sectors of water\n            and energy were successfully supported as part of the\n            service delivery agenda under the first PRSC/G series.\n            Elevating the dialogue on these sub sectors allowed donor\n            partners and GoR to address policy issues more efficiently\n            and effectively than had been the case exclusively through\n            projects. Sector priorities, support for local level private\n            operator schemes in water, extra electricity generation\n            capacity in energy, that were not being fully addressed\n            through projects received support under the PRSC/G series.\n            Inclusion in the PRSC/G series also forced these sub sectors\n            to examine weaknesses in sector strategies, policy\n            frameworks, Medium Term Economic Framework (MTEFs), and\n            planning and budgeting, and established a foundation for, or\n            accelerated, donor cooperation and the move to sector-wide\n            approaches. 3) In large measure, members of the Bank team,\n            including the task team leader and sector specialists,\n            remained the same over the course of all three PRSC/Gs in\n            the series. While this is unfortunately more often an\n            exception rather than the rule, continuity in team\n            leadership and team members was a contributing factor to the\n            success of the program. GoR strongly highlighted the impact\n            that team continuity had on the exceptionally robust\n            dialogue between GoR and the PRSC/G team. Such continuity\n            facilitated the building of strong relationships and trust\n            and understanding amongst all parties and allowed for\n            consistent follow-through on the agreed reform program. 4)\n            While significant progress is evident within sectors, more\n            work is needed to strengthen cross-sectoral linkages. The\n            health and water sectors have taken steps to coordinate\n            their efforts, but much more needs to be done to capture\n            synergies between sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - First, Second, and Third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit/Grant"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - First, Second, and Third\n

(PRSP). The PRSP\n            focuses on (a) creating a favorable private sector\n            investment climate to promote macroeconomic stability and\n            sustained economic growth; (b) improving quality, coverage,\n            and equity of basic service delivery through improved\n            expenditure efficiency; and (c) supporting overall\n            improvement of public expenditure management and governance,\n            with an emphasis on transparency and accountability to\n            citizens' voice and participation. In line with this\n            agenda, the project continues and deepens support to the\n            Government as it implements the next steps in its reform\n            program supported by PRSC I. This includes (a) maintaining a\n            stable macroeconomic framework, creating a strong basis for\n            private sector-led economic growth, driven by agricultural\n            transformation, promotion of exports, and deepening of the\n            financial sector; (b) strengthening the results orientation\n            of its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and\n            associated sectoral MTEFs, particularly in education,\n            health, water, and energy; strengthening the linkages\n            between MTEF priorities and the budget; and expanding\n            performance-based contracting of services; and (c) continued\n            strengthening of governance and transparency, by improving\n            the fiduciary framework and empowering local communities. At\n            the Government's request, policy dialogue in the\n            transport sector has been added under PRSG II, though this\n            sector will also continue to benefit from investment\n            support.
