Following are lessons learned from the\n            project: Post-conflict countries often face the urgent\n            challenge of rebuilding critical infrastructure and\n            restoring basic services. An effective and transparent\n            procurement process requires: well-defined procedures,\n            adequate training, rigorous internal monitoring, regular\n            independent external evaluations, and appropriate and\n            enforceable penalties and a commitment to invoke them.\n            Project design should focus on developing results-based\n            monitoring and evaluation systems. Projects aimed at\n            supporting poor communities and specific beneficiary groups\n            should have a coherent targeting mechanism in place.\n            Decentralizing project responsibilities such as procurement\n            can be an effective means of building local capacity.\n            Partnerships with other development organizations can be\n            used to facilitate local participation, improve reach to\n            poorer and more remote communities, and help ensure\n            sustainability. Although day-to-day implementation\n            challenges may demand immediate attention, larger country\n            context issues relevant to the project should be closely\n            tracked and accommodated as needed to increase project\n            impact and sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia -
