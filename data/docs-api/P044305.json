The temptation to put\n            in place special mechanisms to protect specific resources\n            and accomplish results is understandable in a weak capacity\n            and governance environment, but institutional enclaves are\n            generally not successful beyond the short term and even when\n            successful in the short term they tend to undermine the\n            already weak local systems and thus long-term development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad and Cameroon - Petroleum Development\n            and Pipeline Project;
