The\n            lessons learned indicate that the implementing agency has\n            adopted for sometime the principles of efficient management,\n            giving attention to proper planning and cost controls in a\n            budget constrained environment. During the project period\n            the program assisted the agency to carry on effective short\n            and mid-term planning, employing advanced tools in its\n            planning and implementation. The main lesson is that the\n            project sustainability prospects remained high throughout\n            the implementation period mainly because it was inserted in\n            a counterpart agency that had adequate, reliable and timely\n            financial planning and programming, managed by well trained\n            and dedicated staff, and able to participate in the\n            development of the country. Financing: Even though the total\n            contribution of the Bank financing was modest (compared to\n            the entire program) the association with a sophisticated\n            Borrower allowed to introduce a major and very significant\n            change in the administration and efficiency of road\n            maintenance. Institutional Development: The fact that a\n            greater emphasis was placed on achieving the institutional\n            development objectives of the project during the last 3\n            years of project implementation indicates that maybe this\n            component could have been given more resources during\n            supervision early on in the project implementation period.\n            Performance Indicators: The early agreement on properly\n            designed and experience-proven outcome and output indicators\n            was useful for the supervision of the project and to assess\n            the satisfactory implementation of the Road Investment and\n            Expenditures Program. These indicators are replicable\n            elsewhere in the region and could be compared with other\n            public works agencies in Chile. Timely reviews allowed to\n            assess the willingness of the implementation agency to take\n            corrective measures. International Competitive Bidding\n            (ICB): When expressions of interest were requested for ICB,\n            there were few companies interested in participating,\n            perhaps dissuaded by the low amount set for the thresholds.\n            This would indicate that it may be convenient to increase\n            such threshold for future projects. In the end, only Chilean\n            affiliates participated in most bids."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Third Road Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile - Third Road Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2418147/chile-third-road-sector-project","projn":"CL-Third Rd Sctr -- P006661","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Business Environment,Health Economics & Finance,Business in Development,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Chile","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20030709112342"},"subsc":"Roads and highways","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,acquisition,asphalt,asphalt\n            roads,budgeting,calibration,concessions,contractors,cost\n            accounting,cost estimates,earth roads,economic\n            analysis,environmental health,environmental\n            studies,expenditures,feasibility studies,financial\n            planning,framework,geographical information\n            systems,grade,gravel,gravel roads,heavy vehicles,Highway\n            Design,impact assessment,intersections,ISO,landscaping,main\n            roads,maintenance costs,managers,overpasses,paved\n            roads,pavement,pavement management,pavement management\n            system,pavements,Police,Pollution,prisons,Private\n            Sector,procurement,purchasing,quality control,rate of\n            return,reporting,road concessions,Road Investment,road\n            investments,road maintenance,road management,road\n            networks,Road Safety,road traffic,road user costs,road\n            widening,Roads,Roads & highways,roughness,routine\n            maintenance,sidewalks,signs,snow,speed,surface\n            treatment,traffic accidents,traffic control,traffic\n            growth,traffic safety,traffic\n            volume,transport,transportation,tunnels,unit costs,unpaved\n            roads,urban roads,ventilation,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,acquisition,asphalt,asphalt\n            roads,budgeting,calibration,concessions,contractors,cost\n            accounting,cost estimates,earth roads,economic\n            analysis,environmental health,environmental\n            studies,expenditures,feasibility studies,financial\n            planning,framework,geographical information\n            systems,grade,gravel,gravel roads,heavy vehicles,Highway\n            Design,impact assessment,intersections,ISO,landscaping,main\n            roads,maintenance costs,managers,overpasses,paved\n            roads,pavement,pavement management,pavement management\n            system,pavements,Police,Pollution,prisons,Private\n            Sector,procurement,purchasing,quality control,rate of\n            return,reporting,road concessions,Road Investment,road\n            investments,road maintenance,road management,road\n            networks,Road Safety,road traffic,road user costs,road\n            widening,Roads,Roads & highways,roughness,routine\n            maintenance,sidewalks,signs,snow,speed,surface\n            treatment,traffic accidents,traffic control,traffic\n            growth,traffic safety,traffic\n            volume,transport,transportation,tunnels,unit costs,unpaved\n            roads,urban roads,ventilation,workers"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF021409-PHRD -
