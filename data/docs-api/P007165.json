Some\n            lessons learned included: as in any adjustment program,\n            Borrower ownership is critical. Because of the\n            Government's strong commitment to the reforms supported\n            by SAL II, the negotiation and implementation of the program\n            was achieved in an environment of mutual confidence. The\n            success of one structural adjustment operation is likely to\n            be repeated in a follow-on operation if: (i) sequencing is\n            appropriate; and (ii) there is continuity in the staff, both\n            in the Government and in the Bank, working on both\n            operations. The financial sector is highly vulnerable to\n            structural economic changes, requiring a gradual and careful\n            sequencing of reforms. In the case of El Salvador, banking\n            sector reforms were well sequenced and gradual\n            (restructuring, capitalization, and privatization of the\n            banks, accompanied by

Progress on implementation of the\n            Bank's assistance strategy will be judged on four\n            criteria: maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic\n            framework; successful implementation of the reform program\n            supported by this loan; government willingness and ability\n            to carry out a comprehensive public sector reform program;\n            and
