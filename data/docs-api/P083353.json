The extension\n            requested by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of Bosnia\n            and Herzegovina on June 29, 2010 is necessary to provide\n            time for implementation and completion of all sub-projects\n            supported by the credits. The Borrower developed a detailed\n            implementation monitoring plan for monthly follow-up with\n            the Bank. However, as some of the delays will affect ongoing\n            procurement, and given that completion of all activities by\n            December 15, 2010 seems unlikely, the Borrower requested\n            extension of the closing date by June 30, 2011. This will be\n            the second extension of the project. Extension was granted\n            earlier to align the closing date of the initial and\n            additional financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Urban\n            Infrastructure and Services Delivery Project : restructuring\n            : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/07/12562713/bosnia-herzegovina-urban-infrastructure-services-delivery-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"BA-Urban Infrastructure & Service\n            Delivery Project -- P083353","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets,Housing & Human Habitats,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100720001318"},"subsc":"Sanitation,Water supply,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Rural Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, action plan, Borrower,\n            budgeting, business plans, Credits, disbursement, equipment,\n            Extension, financial management, financial management\n            system, ID, IP, procurement, result, traffic, Treasury"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF030454-AUSTRIA GENERAL CTF FY04 - ECA","repnb":"55725"},"facets":{}}}
