Lessons learned from the project: The Bank is\n            well positioned to respond to similar emergency events in\n            the future. To effectively do so, the Bank must continue to\n            mobilize expertise not only during the immediate response\n            phase, but also throughout implementation. There can be\n            significant advantages to implementing programs for the OECS\n            through a regional entity. By coordinating various aspects\n            of implementation, such as institutional strengthening and\n            the provision of training, the entity directly supports\n            participating country's ability to address regional\n            issues. Regional procurement can bring important cost\n            benefits. The participating governments would have greatly\n            benefited by pooling procurement resources to purchase\n            standardized equipment in bulk.
