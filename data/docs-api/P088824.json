- Second Road Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second Road Maintenance\n            and Rehabilitation Project for Poland were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            mixing quick-disbursing operations with capacity building\n            risks disappointment. It was logical for the Bank to offer\n            relatively large, quick-disbursing support to a part of the\n            infrastructure that is perennially a poor cousin:\n            maintenance and rehabilitation because the new economy of\n            the enlarged European Union (EU) is very much reliant on\n            intra-EU trade and much of that trade is road-based; and\n            because mobility is a fairly high priority among consumption\n            goals in new middle income countries. However, institutional\n            change is never rapid, even in a literate, educated country,\n            especially during a period of political instability. It may\n            be tempting to the fast-disbursing elements of a project\n            will generate leverage to induce institutional change, but\n            success is far from assured. Since the first of these loans,\n            the Bank has rightly increased emphasis on results as the\n            central criterion for evaluating success and hence for\n            orienting management attention - 'what gets measured\n            gets managed' - both in the Bank and in the\n            borrower's administration. These operations, which\n            embody that policy, suggest that the key performance\n            indicators should become an integral part of the loan\n            agreement, rather than a supplementary letter which is not\n            (clearly) in the public domain, so that everyone gives them\n            more prominence in design and implementation. At the same\n            time, attention needs to be paid to ensuring consistency and\n            clarity in the definition of the indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Second Road Maintenance

          financial viability, and road user satisfaction. The project\n            includes two components: 1) The General Directorate for\n            National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) road maintenance and\n            rehabilitation program; and, 2) implementation of GDDKiA\n            management information system (MIS). The road maintenance\n            and rehabilitation program has been prepared by GDDKiA\n            within the framework of the 2005 budget. For the period\n            beyond 2005 the proposed program is expected to be well\n            balanced between maintenance-rehabilitation, strengthening\n            and reconstruction of existing roads, together with new\n            construction of motorways and expressways. Its financing\n            will be from both, domestic and foreign sources. The second\n            component - GDDKiA MIS - will support the implementation of\n            a modem management and information system (MIS) within\n            GDDKiA, that will properly integrate all data necessary to\n            efficiently carry out its activities (including technical,\n            financial, human resources, and contract related data) and\n            support all core functions and decision-making processes\n            within GDDKiA. This Component will include, but not be\n            limited to: a) development of an Enterprise Resource\n            Planning (ERP), consisting of integrated modules such as\n            planning, controlling, finances, fixed assets management,\n            human resources management, and project management; b)\n            development of a system workflow for the management of\n            documents and information; and, c) procurement of any\n            related system, supporting equipment, and hardware/software."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -

In\n            accordance with the European Union (EU) laws and regulation,\n            Polish legislation on the environment stipulates there is no\n            requirement for an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for\n            individual sub-projects financed by the Bank loan.\n            Nevertheless, Polish law includes provisions on mandatory\n            control of environmental risks to soil, land, air, water\n            resources, noise emissions, and other, which may result from\n            implementation of project activities. The Environmental\n            Mitigation Measures Matrix presented in this report\n            identifies possible negative impacts on environment, lists\n            the regulatory controls and technical guidance applicable in\n            roads sector interventions in Poland, specifies the\n            mitigation measures inherent in these controls, and a\n            summary of the monitoring and reporting measures. Upon\n            area-specific conditions, construction contracts for\n            sub-projects defined as type \"B\" projects, will\n            refer to specific measures such as prevention of tree\n            cutting and runoff control, and specify mandatory\n            requirements set by standards and guidelines. In all cases\n            the contractors are responsible to observe applicable\n            national laws, and are subject to monitoring by\n            Environmental Inspectorates during works implementation.\n            Project location shall consider potential environmental\n            adversity, taking into account: existing land use, relative\n            abundance, quality and regenerative capacity of natural\n            resources in the area, values of natural environment and\n            landscape, conditions of the local land-use plans, having\n            regard, in particular, to: wetlands; coastal zones; mountain\n            and forest areas; protected areas, including the protection\n            zones of water intakes and protection areas of\n            surface-waters ponds; special protection areas because of\n            existing fauna and flora and natural habitats; areas in\n            which the environmental quality standards have already been\n            exceeded; populated areas; and, landscapes of historical,\n            cultural or archaeological significance.
