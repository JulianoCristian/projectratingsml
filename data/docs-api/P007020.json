Likewise, both the Bank\n            and Borrower performances were unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            outline the following, but most strikingly, the importance\n            of a significant analysis of risks for fulfilling\n            developmental objectives, particularly when dealing with\n            known agencies within borrowers facing difficult\n            circumstances. Among the many lessons, some specific ones\n            reinforce and convey that projects with the objective to\n            test methodologies for public interventions in the rural\n            sector, need to ensure that baseline studies are available,\n            and monitoring and evaluation systems in place to evaluate\n            those methodologies, at the early stages of project\n            preparation. This also leads to the issue of transfers of\n            irrigation schemes from the public sector to water user\n            organizations (WUOs), a process that requires political\n            will, and adequate transfer policies and processes. In these\n            cases, the Bank should make clear agreements with the\n            Borrower before, or during loan negotiations on those\n            policies and processes, and on the specific support needed\n            to implement such processes. In addition, the participatory\n            process of technology transfer requires both agronomic, and\n            agro-economic analyses, therefore the monitoring system\n            should carry out agronomic and agro-economic studies to\n            ensure that technologies and methodologies are profitable\n            and sustainable. Notwithstanding, the costs per beneficiary\n            of training, technical assistance, investment support and\n            administration should be closely monitored, and contained\n            within limits that are acceptable from a replicable point of view."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic -

This will imply waiving on an exceptional\n            basis in regard to the Refinancing of a PPF, thus allowing\n            that the refinancing costs of the above PPF be funded\n            through this loan. As per the Constitution of the Dominican\n            Republic, this amendment will have to be ratified by\n            Congress. Nevertheless, the amendment will serve the\n            country's needs, and support their recovery efforts in\n            this critical macroeconomic juncture; as such, it should be\n            approved by the Board. Despite years of sustained growth,\n            the country entered a period of recession, which although\n            not fully evaluated, the social impacts of the crisis are\n            dramatic, and the economy continues in crisis. The tight\n            fiscal discipline required to meet the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF) targets, in addition to postponing the\n            proposed project, is precluding the Government to proceed\n            with an immediate repayment of the PPF advance, and accrued\n            interests to the Bank. Given the above reasons, and the\n            proper utilization of advance funds, the Board shall amend\n            the Loan Agreement to include a new component that would\n            cover the re-payment of the PPF through this Loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic -

both for efficient production\n            support services, water management, and operation and\n            maintenance of irrigation systems and for sustainable and\n            environmentally sound watershed management. The criteria for\n            selection of the three irrigation areas were based on\n            agronomic and economic potential as well as the strength of\n            local water users' associations, which are key project\n            beneficiaries and implementing agencies. The project will\n            also rehabilitate and improve existing irrigation systems\n            and strengthen user associations for the development and\n            management of the selected irrigated areas and the Nizao\n            watershed. The Nizao watershed was chosen because of the\n            existence of a strong, local nongovernmental organization\n            that will play a key role in mobilizing community\n            participation in the project. Last, the project should help\n            reduce the fiscal cost of irrigation schemes to the\n            government through appropriate cost-recovery policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Irrigated Land and\n            Watershed Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominican Republic - Irrigated\n            Land and Watershed Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/01/5678728/dominican-republic-irrigated-land-watershed-management-project","projn":"DO-Irrig Land & Watersh (Sim) -- P007020","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Use,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Agricultural Research,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Dominican Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050321144117"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Agricultural extension and research,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agronomic characters; Community\n            participation; Cost recovery; Environmental impact\n            assessment; Environmental indicators; Irrigation;\n            Nongovernmental organizations; Water management; Watershed management,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agronomic characters; Community\n            participation; Cost recovery; Environmental impact\n            assessment; Environmental indicators; Irrigation;\n            Nongovernmental organizations; Water management; Watershed management,"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"trustfund":"TF038519-HAITI:  SUSTAINABLE\n            CONSERVATION, DR IRRIGATED LANDS,TF038486-DOMINICAN REPUBLIC:  IRRIGATED\n            LANDS & WATERSHED MGT.","repnb":"12233"},"facets":{}}}
