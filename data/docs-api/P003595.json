The lessons learned indicate that despite\n            the time pressure during project preparation and appraisal,\n            a lot of attention was paid to design details including\n            breakdown of costs and procurement down to county level.\n            Even more importantly, the scope of the project was well\n            focused, and preparation avoided the inclusion of too many\n            or too sophisticated components. In emergency reconstruction\n            programs, early availability of funds or authorization,\n            together with competent business procedures and record\n            keeping are essential to address the disaster repairs in a\n            timely manner. Dedicated high-level government management\n            and close interaction between Provincial, Prefecture and\n            County-level management teams is essential to achieve\n            success. In emergency reconstruction programs, Assisting\n            individual households in their recovery from an emergency\n            situation requires considerable attention to a well\n            thought-through targeting of the limited resources. Due to\n            its emergency nature the project focuses on reconstruction\n            of physical and social infrastructure. However, a crucial\n            part of the success towards this aim was the training\n            provided under the project. A strong emphasis on input and\n            output monitoring, reporting, and supervision has\n            contributed to a quality implementation of the project. The\n            transfer of this management approaches will serve the\n            implementing agencies well in many future activities. The\n            lesson is to be careful in including tasks in an emergency\n            project that involves continual coordination between line\n            agencies. While the other components were under the primary\n            responsibility of the Project Management Office (PMO) staff\n            located in the Animal Husbandry Bureau (AHB) and the\n            Financial Bureau (FB), the rehabilitation of schools and\n            clinics required strong involvement of the FB as well as the\n            bureaus for education and health on various levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Inner Mongolia Snowstorm Emergency\n            Recovery Component Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Inner Mongolia Snowstorm\n            Emergency Recovery Component Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/11/2850884/china-inner-mongolia-snowstorm-emergency-recovery-component-project","projn":"CN-Second Red Soils Area Dev.

Moreover, production diversification was a\n            contributing factor, particularly in minimizing risks of\n            weather-related crop-damage: diversifying orchard crops with\n            deciduous fruits, i.e., plum, pear, and peach, or citrus\n            varieties, as well as lychee, longan, and loquat, gave\n            positive results, following the careful site selection of\n            frost-susceptible crops. The need for diversification is\n            reinforced by the volatility of agricultural market prices;\n            however, production marketing, particularly of high-value\n            fruit output, requires strengthening of market information\n            systems, and assistance to growers in setting-up marketing\n            groups.
