Ratings for the\n            First, Second, Third Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery\n            Credit Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Fourth Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit Grant\n            Project were as follows:  outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            and the Bank and the Borrower performance were satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included:  overall, the ERR operations\n            were effective in providing critical budget support to\n            Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) during the initial\n            post-conflict years. The effectiveness was greater in\n            directly supporting the demobilization effort under the DDR\n            program, achieving the initial protective, social, and\n            economic security advances, and in accomplishing process\n            improvements, than in achieving better governance, improved\n            allocation of budget resources and development results in\n            the longer run. Early start of Bank interventions and\n            informed risk taking can help consolidate the peace process.\n            Delayed adoption of a country strategy and programmatic\n            budget support weakens ownership, creates funding\n            uncertainty, and hampers capacity building under the\n            circumstances. Stronger signaling of longer-term resource\n            availability for budget support and capacity-building\n            substitutes for the lack of formal programmatic framework.\n            While project or program designs were kept simple and\n            realistic, more could have been done to develop an\n            appropriate results framework calibrated to post-conflict\n            country circumstances. The Bank is (often) expected to\n            assume a leading role in mobilizing and coordinating\n            external donor assistance in post-conflict situations, and\n            is not always adequately resourced to do this. In\n            recognition of this, post-conflict Bank programs may benefit\n            from senior management support that would enable country\n            teams to more appropriately structure

The\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            satisfactory. The lessons cited from this project echoed\n            lessons learned from ERRC I-III, and are recommended for\n            other countries characterized by low capacity, resulting\n            from conflict or other causes, and high aid dependency. They\n            include: not relying on the single tranche model as a\n            guarantee of predictable funds release; being proactive in\n            facilitating good outcome; reducing the number and\n            complexity of conditions and aligning them with the\n            administrative and implementing capacity of Government;\n            finding an   empowered leader from within the Government to\n            coordinate implementation of the reform program; being\n            prepared to invest extra resources into the supervision\n            effort; seeking a better fit between triggers, the degree of\n            consensus within Government leadership circles, and the\n            degree of technical and administrative capacity within\n            implementing ministries; and  embarking on a medium-term\n            comprehensive program of capacity building.

achievements as demonstrated\n            by the outcome of the credit; Bank support for policy\n            reforms should therefore continue to seek to integrate the\n            efforts of other

Rehabilitation and\n            Recovery Grant (ERRG4) Project will provide quick disbursing\n            support to the Government's 2005 budget in a single\n            tranche. This project (the fourth in a series), is designed\n            to consolidate Sierra Leone's transition from\n            peace-keeping and relief aid, to equitable and sustainable\n            development, in the context of Sierra Leone's Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy. The ERRG4 will provide critical\n            resources to consolidate and deepen the agenda set by the\n            ERRC series, including progress made in governance,\n            decentralization of government, management of public\n            resources, human resource development, and private\n            sector-led economic growth. The grant will contribute to\n            economic recovery and growth, by providing foreign exchange\n            resources for the imports of essential commodities, by\n            providing financial resources to the Government budget, to\n            finance priority public expenditures, and by supporting\n            reforms to attract private investment. In helping to close\n            the financing gap in 2005, it will also contribute to\n            maintaining macroeconomic stability, and low inflation.\n            However risks include delayed or inadequate public services\n            that could exacerbate poverty, and possibly lead to social\n            unrest; the budget is heavily dependent upon external\n            assistance; macroeconomic stability could prove difficult to\n            maintain; and, weak institutional capacity could cause\n            delays in implementing the program; and, conflict in\n            neighboring Cote d'Ivoire may affect trade, or spill\n            over into Sierra Leone, while slow or incomplete disarmament\n            in Liberia could create tensions between Guinea and Sierra\n            Leone, which could spark a new war."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Fourth Economic\n            Rehabilitation and Recovery Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra
