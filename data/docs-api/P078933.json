Some lessons learned included: although\n            municipalities were charged with implementing school\n            construction activities, they did not have the capacity to\n            comply with World Bank safeguards and fiduciary\n            requirements. At the same time, the Ministry of Education\n            and Science (MoES) did not, and still does not, have a\n            mechanism to compel the municipalities to act, which puts at\n            risk the infrastructure investments supported by the\n            project. To support Albania's decentralized system of\n            government and ensure achievement and sustainability of\n            outcomes, there must be a formal mechanism (e.g. memoranda\n            of understanding between the MoES and relevant\n            municipalities) to ensure transparency and accountability\n            for project outcomes at the level of the implementing\n            agencies. Such mechanisms have been used in other countries\n            to link resources to agreements reached between central and\n            sub-national government entities, as well as to results\n            achieved through project interventions. The project yields\n            some important lessons regarding civil works, which were\n            time consuming and unsystematic under the EEEP. Supervising\n            civil works was costly and excessively laborious given that\n            the EEEP constructed and rehabilitated 22 schools while the\n            Government undertook a parallel civil works program that\n            supported an additional 1,152 schools between 2006 until\n            2012. The Government's demonstrated capacity to manage\n            civil works should discourage the Bank's future\n            involvement. Going forward, the MoES must ensure that\n            standard designs are followed across all municipalities in\n            order to ensure that facilities are appropriate for an\n            educational context and for use by children and adolescents.\n            Quality could be improved if the architect would also\n            supervise implementation of the civil works. Furthermore,\n            school administrators should be involved in the school\n            design and construction process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Education Excellence and Equity
