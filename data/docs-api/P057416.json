Bank performance was\n            satisfactory and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Several lessons were drawn from this project including the\n            following: 1) Culturally-based productive initiatives of\n            indigenous producer groups can constitute a financial and\n            economic valid alternative for improving their incomes and\n            for poverty reduction. 2) Indigenous peoples can improve\n            their incomes by accessing markets through the provision of\n            products and services that are not necessarily\n            \"indigenous.\" 3) It is useful to differentiate\n            support for productive initiatives from support for local\n            development plans. 4) Project Directorates involving social\n            organizations need to reflect the specific composition of\n            the intended beneficiaries. 5) Direct transfers induce\n            positive effects beyond the objectives of subprojects\n            themselves. Effective empowerment is a result of new-found\n            confidence in managing projects and funds, and can have\n            large spill-over effects over other areas of community life.\n            6) Training indigenous people to participate in the\n            monitoring and evaluation of poverty reduction policies is\n            an important feature for future interventions to have\n            adequate impact. 7) A project such as this, which requires\n            setting up new institutional mechanisms, and involves actors\n            with low capacities, needs to be given sufficient time for\n            implementation. Testing out and failure need to be included\n            in the design, and sufficient time needs to be allotted for\n            follow up and evaluation beyond the investment phase. 8) A\n            key lesson learned in this project is the importance of\n            proper technical assistance. 9) The failure of the use of a\n            management services entity in this particular learning\n            process should not invalidate the use of a private\n            management unit provided that adequate procedures for the\n            selection and supervision processes are followed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Indigenous Peoples Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Indigenous Peoples\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/04/6804624/bolivia-indigenous-peoples-development-project","projn":"BO-Indigenous Peoples Development Project -- P057416","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Knowledge Economy,ICT Policy and Strategies,Community Development and Empowerment,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Education for the Knowledge Economy","teratopic":"Education,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Social Development","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060522115838"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Other industry,Other domestic and international trade,Crops","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Information and Communication Technologies,Social Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"beneficiaries, capacity building, CAS, civic\n            engagement, collaboration, communities, community\n            initiatives, community members, community procurement,\n            consultation, cost benefit analysis, eligibility criteria,\n            Exchange Rate, farm income, field visits, HIPC, ICR, impact\n            evaluation, IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT, Income,\n            indigenous groups, indigenous organizations, innovations,\n            institutional framework, Learning, Lessons Learned, natural\n            resource management, outcome indicators, participatory\n            evaluation, participatory monitoring, pilot projects, policy\n            initiatives, portfolios, poverty alleviation, Poverty\n            Reduction, procurement, programs, Project Appraisal, project\n            evaluation, Project Implementation, Project Management,\n            project objectives, project preparation, social capital,\n            social services, Sustainable Development, technical\n            criteria, Technicians, text, traditional knowledge, transparency"}},"owner":"Social Development (LCSSO)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Learning and Innovation Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF025601-PHRD-INDIGENOUS PEOPLES DEV.

There are three project components. The first\n            component finances as a pilot a number of demand-driven,\n            community or small-producer initiatives, which aim to\n            improve the forms and conditions in which indigenous peoples\n            produce and sell their products and services. This component\n            also includes grant financing of pre-investment studies,\n            technical assistance, small works, goods and operational\n            costs for investments. The second component supports\n            institutional strengthening and training of national level\n            indigenous/campesino organizations and their regional\n            organizations. Activities to be strengthened include\n            operational monitoring, collection of basic information\n            needed for the learning process, participatory evaluation,\n            and feedback into the poverty reduction strategy's\n            social control mechanism. Assistance and training funded by\n            this component covers the hiring of consultants, training\n            and consultation workshops for project evaluation and\n            learning and for PRS adjustment, specialists to coordinate\n            the monitoring and learning process, designing and operating\n            a monitoring and evaluation system, and contracting for an\n            independent impact evaluation study.
