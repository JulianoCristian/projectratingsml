Some lessons learned included: 1) With\n            respect to program coordination, Kenya HIV/AIDS Disaster\n            Response Project (KHADREP) support to National HIV/AIDS\n            Control Council (NACC) has been essential for the progress\n            which has been achieved, and support should be continued\n            under the planned new Project (TOWA). Future support should\n            also be linked to the full implementation of NACC's\n            institutional restructuring plan, and NACC's delivery\n            of the specific results outlined in the Kenya National\n            HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP) 2005-2010 results framework;\n            2) Attention should be paid to both the internal and the\n            external domains of public sector programs when the emphasis\n            of the work of the AIDS Control Units (ACUs) has been on the\n            internal domain; 3) The role of the financial management\n            agent (FMA) and the arrangements to mitigate concerns about\n            inappropriate selection of projects and \"briefcase\n            NGOs\" should be strengthened; 4) The lack of an\n            effective programmatic monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            has made it difficult to quantify the impact of the KHADREP.\n            This is a lesson that applies not only to Kenya, but more\n            generally to other countries fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic;\n            and 5) The KHADREP experience shows that the NACC needs\n            leadership that is creative, results-based, effective in\n            communications, collaborative and with complete integrity.\n            In addition to the specific investments needed in such areas\n            as financial management strengthening, internal oversight\n            and audit, and the development of a fiduciary risk\n            management policy, strengthening local decision-making,\n            monitoring and accountability at the central and local\n            levels, communications, it is also critically important that\n            the newly recruited senior staff at the NACC should be\n            trained and supported to enable them to function effectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - HIV/AIDS Disaster Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - HIV/AIDS Disaster\n            Response Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/04/7591298/kenya-hivaids-disaster-response-project","projn":"KE-Hiv/Aids Disaster Response Project -- P070920","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Early Child and Children's Health,HIV AIDS,Technology Industry,Population Policies,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070509095903"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absenteeism, accountability, accounting,\n            accounting procedures, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome,\n            AIDS deaths, AIDS epidemic, AIDS Prevention, AIDS Program,\n            awareness raising, behavior change, behavioral changes,\n            Behaviour Change, Blood Transfusion, capacity building,\n            Child health, civil society organizations, Commercial Sex,\n            Commercial Sex Workers, community activities, Components,\n            condom, condom dispensers, condom distribution, condom\n            promotion, condoms, Control Units, CPU, development of\n            policies, discrimination, Employment, Employment Creation,\n            financial management, gender issues, high-risk groups, HIV,\n            HIV AIDS, Home Affairs, Immune Deficiency, Injecting Drug\n            Users, institutional capacity, Institutional Development,\n            International Conference on AIDS, key performance\n            indicators, lack of capacity, local communities, Local\n            Government, Marketing, media, Ministry of Health, mortality,\n            mortality rates, Mother, Mother to Child, Mother to Child\n            Transmission, Multi-Country AIDS, NATIONAL AIDS, NATIONAL\n            AIDS CONTROL, National Council, national levels, National\n            Plan, national strategy, Natural Resources, networking, new\n            infections, operating costs, Opportunistic Infection,\n            orphan, orphan support, Orphans, participation of\n            communities, participatory process, population density, Post\n            Exposure Prophylaxis, prevalence rate, prevalence rates,\n            prevention efforts, preventive activities, progress, public\n            debate, Public Service, reproductive health, research\n            institutions, Rural Development, safety nets, service\n            delivery, service providers, Sex with Men, sexual partner,\n            Social safety nets, social services, support for people,\n            Transmission, Transport, Tuberculosis, UNAIDS, unmarried\n            men, unmarried women, Voluntary Counselling, Vulnerable\n            Children, vulnerable populations, Water Resources, young people"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 1 (AFTH1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF030371-DANISH CTF FY03 - SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA,TF054879-NORWEGIAN EDUCATION TRUST FUND,TF055300-SIDA FUNDING OF A SR.

The project is\n            the first phase of the regional Program, covering Ethiopia,\n            and Kenya, who have met the eligibility criteria for\n            accessing funds under the MAP, developed comprehensive\n            multi-sectoral strategic plans for the medium term, and\n            endorsed the principle of public/private partnerships, to\n            implement their national strategies, and assume overall\n            program coordination. Each individual country project\n            operation has their own specific development objectives, but\n            provide the basis for this program. The program for Ethiopia\n            will finance the Government's 2000-2004 HIV/AIDS\n            strategic plan, that include support for capacity building\n            within, both private, and government agencies. Prevention,\n            care, and treatment activities will also be financed, to\n            expand the public multi-sectoral response of civil society,\n            and communities to the AIDS epidemic. The Kenya program will\n            intensify the fight against AIDS, supporting five priority\n            areas, that include prevention, and advocacy, treatment and\n            support of the
