development impacts substantial. Main lessons are suggested\n            as follows. Fundamental to the success of the Agricultural\n            Sector Management Project, was the implementation of\n            macroeconomic reform programs in the first half of the 90s,\n            critical for the implementation of the institutional\n            reforms, and capacity building initiatives of the project,\n            and its development objectives. Also critical, is the\n            implementation of broad reform measures, demonstrated by\n            either the presence, or lack thereof, of certain overarching\n            institutional reforms, and guidelines, which both fostered,\n            or hindered the progress of project activities,\n            respectively. However, although the project succeeded in\n            curtailing the Ministry of Agriculture's costs through\n            retrenchment, and streamlining functions, the savings made\n            did not result in returns to the Ministry, for neither\n            increased operating costs, nor salaries were obtained, which\n            was contrary to management expectations, and rather hindered\n            an aggressive move in the reform process. Thus, as seen by\n            the project outcome, a sustained long-term assistance that\n            realizes the full benefit of institutional reform, is\n            needed, through follow-up projects to carry forward the\n            project initiatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Agricultural Sector Management\n            (ASMP) Projet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania
