Lessons learned from the project:\n            When new project agencies and implementing units are being\n            established in conjunction with a project, and related\n            institutional and financial sector reforms are to be\n            advanced, this project demonstrated the importance of\n            setting the corresponding reform targets. While the\n            monitoring indicators provided in the SAR, and subsequently\n            enhanced in conjunction with the additional works, were\n            overall comprehensive in the Chinese context.

The project will\n            support policy and institutional innovation, and provide\n            physical works for wastewater handling, air pollution\n            control, and solid waste management. Its components are the\n            following: 1) Wastewater management in Huangshi, Wuhan and\n            Xiangfan, comprising sewer systems, pump stations, and\n            wastewater treatment facilities; 2) municipal wastes\n            management in Huangshi, Wuhan, Xiangfan and Yichang,\n            comprising sanitary landfill development, waste transfer\n            facilities,
