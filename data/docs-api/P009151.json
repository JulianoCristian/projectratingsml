The civil\n            works component of the project was successfully completed\n            generally in line with the appraisal schedule. However, the\n            training program, which was a new feature of Bank highway\n            lending in Yugoslavia, experienced considerable delay due to\n            cultural and administrative difficulties not envisioned at\n            appraisal. Overall, this project has been successful and the\n            Bank and Borrowers are generally pleased with the results.\n            One sub-Borrower did express some apprehension over the\n            increasing cost of borrowing from the Bank due to exchange\n            rate fluctuations. This is a situation which the Bank has\n            been studying for some time. Lessons learned from the\n            project include: 1) the need for a thorough investigation of\n            traffic potential; 2) the need to review the impact of tolls\n            and their effect on traffic; 3) careful development of a\n            training program and adequate attention to constraints; and\n            4)Borrower's concern over exchange rate risk in Bank loans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia -
