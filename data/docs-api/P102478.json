Sanitation Services through Output-Based Aid (OBA)\n            Scheme Project for Senegal were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the technological options should\n            not be too firmly set at the outset. Thus, in this case,\n            one-quarter of the facilities ultimately built were options\n            not originally proposed: connections to existing condominium\n            systems and construction of the superstructure by\n            beneficiaries themselves. It should be possible for the\n            payment percentages going to various stakeholders (main\n            contractor, social engineering, construction companies,\n            etc.) to evolve during project implementation. The principle\n            of full payment of the beneficiary's contribution\n            before work can begin appears too rigid and does not\n            encourage participation by the most underprivileged\n            populations. Ways to spread out the contributions should be\n            examined when future projects are implemented. This could be\n            done either (i) through the project, with well defined\n            requirements to be met, or (ii) by relying on microcredit\n            organizations, with membership arrangements and repayment\n            rates that do not excessively increase the size of the\n            household contribution. The method of calculating the\n            subsidy per facility should be absolutely explicit because\n            this is an important indicator for monitoring the project.\n            In this project, the project appraisal document, or PAD did\n            not specify whether the subsidy ceiling was supposed to\n            apply to each individual facility or rather, as an average\n            figure, to all the facilities as a whole. This point should\n            be spelled out clearly in upcoming projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Supporting Access to On-Site\n            Sanitation Services through Output-Based Aid (OBA) Scheme Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal -

While the project is seen as having\n            tremendous upside for the community, there are several\n            potential negative impacts resulting primarily from the\n            construction phase. The laying of the sewer mains may result\n            in damage to trees and vegetation, and as a result, there is\n            a risk of soil erosion. Noise pollution will be a problem,\n            as well as the possibility of accidents occurring during\n            excavation.
