Some lessons\n            learned included: the project's demand-driven feature\n            improves local governance by giving poor rural communities a\n            unique set of experiences involving: collective action;\n            priority-setting; decision-making; and subproject financial\n            management, operation and maintenance. Social capital under\n            this and similar projects is both a benefit in its own right\n            and an element in the success of community-driven rural\n            poverty reduction. Tangible benefits from subproject\n            investments strengthen collective capacity, generate a sense\n            of citizenship, and raise the bar for local government\n            accountability. By delegating responsibility for day-to-day\n            implementation to regional technical offices, the\n            project's markedly increased its visibility and\n            accountability to beneficiary families. The proximity of\n            assistance activities including technical and legal support\n            reduce subproject processing times, strengthen the Community\n            Association (CAs') management capacity and increase the\n            quality and frequency of State Technical Unit (STU)\n            supervision of overall implementation. Community-Driven\n            Development (CDD) can effectively target and empower poor\n            rural women: Experience in Pernambuco and elsewhere shows\n            unequivocally that demand-driven mechanisms not only enable\n            women to access the benefits of community investments, but\n            provide important leadership/learning opportunities for\n            women through the community associations and Municipal\n            Councils. The project showed that participatory,\n            demand-driven mechanisms are consistent with the cultural\n            practices of these groups and that they can manage the\n            subproject cycle, including its participatory mechanisms, effectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Rural Poverty Reducation Project - Pernambuco"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Rural
