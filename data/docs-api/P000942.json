Ratings for the\n            Natural Resources Management Project were as follows:\n            outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome\n            was significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included from the project: it is essential to gauge\n            support at higher levels of government than the concerned\n            environmental agencies. Care has to be taken that\n            international environmental pressure, vested interests and\n            the understandable enthusiasm of the Bank's own\n            appraisal process does not lead to financing of worthy\n            causes that governments are unwilling to support. Care has\n            to be taken that individuals and community stakeholders are\n            empowered in the decision-making process, particularly over\n            allocation of rights to utilize natural resources. The\n            assessed projects clearly show that insecure property rights\n            allied with centralized, top-down award of concessions to\n            commercial operations and capture of economic rents creates\n            conflict and promotes non-sustainable natural resource\n            utilization. When partners operate on differing schedules\n            and priorities there is a danger that mixed signals will be\n            passed to the in-country stakeholders. In that respect\n            common pool budget support mechanisms have a strategic\n            advantage in bringing coherence to reform agendas.\n            Insufficient attention to addressing the causes of rural\n            poverty drives people to live off the environmental commons\n            where short-term survival interests typically outweigh\n            consideration of longer-term stability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Environmental Resource Management\n            Project: GEF Coastal Wetlands Management Project; Natural\n            Resources Management

While the project correctly identified the\n            risk that, recognition of the five coastal wetland sites\n            under the Ramsar Convention may not be achieved, it wrongly\n            assumed that this could be minimized by the availability of\n            project funds for other activities, but project funds did\n            not shorten the significant delay in government approvals.\n            Therefore, the project overestimated, both the level of\n            government ownership, and the availability of counterpart\n            funds. Lessons re-emphasize that close involvement with\n            stakeholders, and communities ensure the sustainability of\n            an operation. Stronger flexibility should have been\n            prevalent in the composition of supervision missions, to be\n            able to adjust the skills mix, to either legal expertise in\n            dealing with the delays in government approvals, or, social\n            expertise in developing suitable methods for monitoring\n            community-level trends, for the sustainable use of wetland\n            resources. Tolerance for weak government agencies'\n            performance can be avoided, by limiting agencies to a\n            defined policy agenda, and instead channel funds through\n            more dynamic, non-governmental organizations, to instead\n            submit project concepts for lesser financing, and, smaller\n            in scope."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

It recommends the establishment and\n            protection of the five most important coastal wetlands as\n            Ramsar sites: Keta lagoon, Songor, Sakumo, Densu delta and\n            Muni. It outlines a management strategy for the selected\n            sites and defines institutional framework and mechanisms for\n            the implementation of the conservation actions proposed\n            (section one). Sections two-five provides detailed\n            management plans for four of the sites, Muni, Songor,\n            Sakumo, and Densu delta. The fourth site, Keta, is a special\n            case. Although the site is the most important seashore bird\n            site on the Ghana coast, it is also the most problematic.\n            The international importance of the Keta lagoon and the\n            socio-ecological problems in the area are high-lighted; and\n            recommendations on studies required for the preparation of\n            detailed management plans for the site are given in section\n            six. Section seven identifies training needs and technical\n            assistance requirements; and also provides a phased plan for\n            implementation of the proposed programs. Cost estimates are\n            given in section eight. It should be emphasized at this\n            point that the preparation of a management plan is a dynamic\n            process. The plans outlined here were based on the\n            information currently available on the sites. As more data\n            become available through the scientific studies recommended,\n            it would be necessary to review and update the plans as and\n            when necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Coastal wetlands management plans"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Coastal wetlands\n            management
