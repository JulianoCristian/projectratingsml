Some lessons learned included:\n            performance-based programming, where funds are released\n            annually based on pre-determined phase-out schedules and\n            targets provides an excellent implementation structure with\n            which to motivate and incentivize stakeholders to find the\n            most cost effective ways to convert to non-ODS technologies\n            and alternatives. Addressing the phase-out of ODS from the\n            perspective of sectors versus project-by-project is a\n            rational and cost-effective way by which to curb non-uniform\n            and diverse consumption of ODS. The use of a phase-out\n            approach that supports policy/regulatory development,\n            technical assistance and capacity-building activities and\n            the provision of financing for inputs to support sustainable\n            ODS phase-out based on annual reduction targets by sector\n            lays the foundations for sustainable management of complex\n            sector and national initiatives. Such an approach\n            necessitates strong, integrated management, where all\n            parties involved clearly understand and embrace their roles\n            and responsibilities. Lessons learned through implementation\n            of the HCHP Plan Project echo those of other projects\n            implemented by the Bank\u2019s Ozone Trust Fund in the region\n            with respect to the value of adopting a national phase out\n            plan approach to strategically address remaining consumption\n            within specific sectors. These lessons have generated\n            economies of scale in terms of knowledge and experience\n            exchange: they have been translated beyond \u2018remaining\n            consumption\u2019 to inform the design and implementation of\n            current performance-based, HCFC sectoral phase out initiatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - National Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)\n
