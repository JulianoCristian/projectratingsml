In September\n            2010, at least 12.7 million families (or nearly 50 million\n            people) were benefited by the program, according to\n            Brazil's Ministry of Social Development and Hunger\n            Alleviation. Bolsa Familia is a CCT program which provides\n            direct cash transfers to poor families who keep their\n            children in school and under regular medical supervision. By\n            this, it seeks to reduce both immediate and future poverty.\n            The Bolsa Familia Program was launched in October 2003,\n            during Brazilian President Luiz Inascio Lula da Silva's\n            first term, as the Government's flagship social program\n            in support of his \u0091zero hunger\u0092 initiative. In fact,\n            Brazilian efforts to address the structural causes of\n            poverty started in 1995, with municipal CCT programs, which\n            led to the creation of several national CCT programs in the\n            early 2000s. In 2003, four existing federal CCT programs\n            were merged into Bolsa Familia. Since the program\u0092s\n            inception in 2003, the World Bank played an important role\n            in the consolidation of first phase of Bolsa Familia, when\n            the program was supported by a US$572 million loan approved\n            in 2004, to help develop, strengthen and expand Brazil\u0092s\n            flagship social protection program. In September 2010, the\n            World Bank approved a US$200 million loan for the second\n            phase of support to Brazil\u0092s Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, which aims to\n            further strengthen Bolsa Familia\u0092s ability to achieve its\n            objectives of reducing poverty and inequality and promoting\n            the use of education and health services of the poor\n            population. Between 2003 and 2009, poverty (PPP $2 per day)\n            has fallen from 22 percent of the population to 7 percent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lifting families out of poverty in Brazil :\n            Bolsa Familia Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lifting families out of poverty\n            in Brazil : Bolsa Familia Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2005/12/23947349/lifting-families-out-poverty-brazil-bolsa-familia-program","count":"Brazil","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"beneficiaries, beneficiary, beneficiary\n            families, Bolsa, cash transfer, cash transfers, Families,\n            health services, Hunger, income, income inequality, labor\n            market, loan, loan amount, poor families, poor population,\n            programs, social protection"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Bresil -

Program-Based Sector-wide\n            Approach (SWAp); and (c) mechanisms to pace disbursements\n            against conditional cash transfers under the Bolsa Familia\n            Program (BFP) in line with technical improvements. These\n            three features will help foster an effective link between\n            the implementation of the BFP while helping strengthen the\n            program through crucial technical assistance. The project\n            has the following five components: Component 1) will provide\n            support to the Government in consolidating and rationalizing\n            conditional cash transfers, and in reducing duplications and\n            gaps in coverage of the BFP, as part of a broader and\n            balanced strategy for economic and human capital\n            development. Component 2) will provide assistance to improve\n            the mechanisms used to identify the target population of the\n            BFP, which constitute a key element of the basic\n            architecture of the program. Component 3) will support the\n            design and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) system. Such a system would constitute a key\n            element of the basic architecture of the program, and one\n            that the Government has made a top priority since the\n            launching of the (BFP). Component 4) will support the\n            strengthening of the basic institutional functioning of the\n            BFP in terms of strengthening of the operational\n            institutional framework; strengthening program management;\n            developing a solid communications and dissemination strategy\n            with consideration of culturally, and ethnically diverse\n            publics; identifying and evaluating social welfare\n            innovations in \"empowerment\" and\n            \"bridging\" approaches. Component 5) will support a\n            strengthening of the implementation capacity of Ministerio\n            do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate a Fome (MDS). To provide\n            such support, the proposed project will finance incremental\n            costs related to management and supervision of Project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Bolsa Familia Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -
