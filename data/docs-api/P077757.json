          Education Quality Improvement Project is to assist the\n            Government of the Department of Cundinamarca to develop the\n            skills in basic and secondary school students that will\n            improve their productivity, competitiveness and overall\n            social skills. The development objectives of the\n            Cundinamarca Education Quality Improvement Project are to:\n            (i) improve the quality and relevance of the education\n            system and (ii) improve the internal and external efficiency\n            of education at the department level, municipal and school\n            levels. There three components to the project. Component 1.\n            this component will support changes to school management and\n            practices in accordance with new legislation and department\n            development plans that seek quality and relevance\n            improvements as well as the identification and\n            implementation of school-community activities to support\n            education for peace projects designed to mitigate the\n            incidence of violence and conflicts. Component 2.  This\n            component will strengthen the institutional and management\n            capacity of the Cundinamarca Education Secretariat (SEC) and\n            the municipalities. The objective of this component is to\n            improve the overall efficiency of the Cundinamarca education\n            system. Component 3. This component will finance the Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) operating within the Education\n            Secretariat of Cundinamarca. The PCU would be responsible\n            for overall project coordination working closely with the\n            line departments within the SEC which in turn will have the\n            responsibility for implementing the project components The\n            PCU will be responsible for planning, monitoring and\n            evaluating the project. Specifically, the PCU will: (i)\n            develop the administrative and technical procedures to\n            assure quality improvements of education through the\n            administrative, financial and pedagogical management of the\n            schools and the decentralized operation of the education\n            system; and (ii) be directly responsible for the technical\n
