Some lessons\n            learned included: it is important to maintain sufficient\n            flexibility to adapt and respond to client needs and\n            economic realities in the country. As the risks in the\n            financial sector were high during the preparation phase,\n            adding a strong sense of urgency to the need to adopt\n            financial sector related reforms, the team worked hard to\n            build sufficient ownership of the many policy and regulatory\n            changes. In particular, previous engagement through\n            knowledge sharing activities (the 2013 FSAP, TAs with BoA)\n            also enabled the WBG to react quickly to the pressing needs\n            of counterparts. This approach proved the importance of\n            continuous engagement with client through capacity building/\n            technical assistance activities during the absence of a\n            lending project. The regular coordination with other\n            partners, combined with providing necessary technical\n            assistance on a timely basis, positively impacted the\n            outcomes achieved. Cooperation with other international\n            agencies (IMF, USAID, and EU) proved essential, given the\n            extensive technical assistance that needed to be coordinated\n            and aligned with the country\u2019s and sector\u2019s priorities. In\n            particular, this project benefited extensively from\n            coordination with IMF on knowledge sharing activities as\n            well as the Fund\u2019s three year EFF program. This program has\n            ensured the adequacy of macroeconomic framework by helping\n            Albania to meet its external financing needs, while\n            providing the necessary support to strengthen fiscal and\n            debt sustainability, lower public financing risks, and put\n            the economy on a sustained growth path."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

The present operation is designed to support the\n            government's reform agenda to address key challenges\n            across the financial sector. The operation is structured\n            around three pillars: (i) strengthening regulation and\n            supervision of the banking sector and financial safety net;\n            (ii) expediting the resolution of non-performing loans\n            (NPLs); and (iii) strengthening the regulation and\n            supervision of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). This\n            is a standalone operation in the amount of United States\n            (U.S.) 100 million dollars. Domestic and external\n            vulnerabilities are high and continue to pose risks to\n            macroeconomic stability. In sum, the financial sector\n            authorities have undertaken significant measures to minimize\n            vulnerabilities in the financial sector, and are currently\n            working on the implementation of several other key reforms\n            to further mitigate risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Financial Sector Modernization\n            Development Policy Loan
