Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) educational infrastructure is an\n            appropriate project objective when it is coupled with a\n            lending program that is focused on quality issues. Large\n            stand-alone operations focused on rehabilitating or\n            constructing educational facilities may have development\n            effectiveness, if the operations are strongly linked to a\n            country's education quality improvement policy and\n            development agenda; 2) when projects involve large amounts\n            of civil works, it may be efficient to separate the\n            educational and the construction roles. A specialized entity\n            with a mandate limited to construction may carry out this\n            role more efficiently than an agency that also has\n            responsibilities for quality, policy and capacity building\n            issues. Conversely, an implementing agency of an education\n            project without an infrastructure component would be able to\n            focus its efforts and resources effectively on complex\n            education content and quality intervention; 3) maintenance\n            and the associated long-term expenditures are an important\n            aspect to consider in educational infrastructure. Contractor\n            quality must be carefully monitored to ensure that works are\n            built to last and do not require extensive repairs soon.\n            Warranty periods should be carefully assessed; and 4) to\n            reduce the number of small schools it may be possible to\n            transport students to larger schools in town. However, this\n            policy would create tradeoffs in terms of expenditures and\n            environmental effects. These could be assessed in future projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - School Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - School Rehabilitation

- Schools Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project ratings are as follows:\n            Project outcome is highly satisfactory; sustainability is\n            likely; institutional development impact is substantial;\n            Bank performance is overall satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance is overall satisfactory. Among the lessons\n            learned are the following. 1) The close linkages and\n            consultations between architects/engineers and education\n            specialists ensured the pedagogical suitability of the\n            rehabilitated facilities. The project has influenced a\n            profound and forward-looking change in the way Romania\n            invests in and manages its educational infrastructure\n            program. 2) School building characteristics can foster or\n            block education reform measures. 3) Community participation\n            in ECA middle-income countries has a different focus than in\n            other regions/countries - more on consultations, not on\n            participation in works. 4) Simultaneous investments and\n            on-going works financed by other authorities tend to create\n            confusion. The differences between the approach used by the\n            Bank and that of other parallel investments need to be\n            emphasized in careful communications with other authorities.\n            5) This project was among the first risk mitigation\n            operations in the HD sector and lessons can be extracted\n            from the project design and its implementation, which\n            included measures and investments addressing the mitigation\n            of the risk of physical injury. 6) A timely decision was\n            made to undertake rehabilitations of historical and cultural\n            monuments only under a co-financing scheme, with the Bank\n            financing only the strengthening costs while local\n            authorities would finance the restoration costs; otherwise\n            the amounts incurred would have left the other schools under\n            the project without necessary funds. 7) Countries in\n            transition face property rights issues; claims on school\n            buildings or land were satisfactorily resolved by local\n            authorities, but they represent sensitive issues and due\n            attention needs to be paid to relevant regulations and laws,\n            often changing during the process. 8) There were few\n            instances in which Local Authorities or other parties\n            committed to finance works in addition to project\n            interventions, but failed to do so in due time; therefore,\n            attention should be paid in the future to such arrangements\n            in order to avoid delays in schools becoming fully\n            operational, as planned. 9) The realistic and economic\n            rehabilitation options adopted under the project and the\n            firm cost control confirmed this was a good option. The\n            project was able to extend its investment benefits to 31.5%\n            more beneficiaries than had been initially targeted. 10) In\n            terms of quality of works and goods, lessons include\n            increased focus on: (a) architectural designs and more\n            precise specifications of materials and fittings to ensure\n            they are appropriate and adapted to education facilities;\n            (b) more involvement of the designers in the site\n            supervision to ensure the quality of construction and\n            increase responsibility for the design choices. 11)\n            Sustained political commitment due to the general\n            recognition of the emergency issues at the top is essential\n            in bringing an operation to successful conclusion\n            notwithstanding a rough sailing. 12) The continuity of\n            staff, combined with a strong presence of staff from the\n            field and proactive country managers, has led to very good\n            borrower and stakeholder relationships."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Schools Rehabilitation
