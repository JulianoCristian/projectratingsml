Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) With upfront agreement of core policy\n            and regulatory reforms, sector institutional development can\n            be successfully carried out, even in a weak country\n            environment provided there is a long term support to\n            implementation of second order reforms generated through\n            project activities; 2) With newly established institutions,\n            caution needs to be exercised in estimation of\n            implementation capacity and there needs to be greater\n            pro-activity on part of the Bank and the Borrower to adjust\n            to the realities on the ground; 3) Effective government\n            ownership and support from the development partners, can\n            lead to initially weak institutions being challenged to\n            deliver more than average results even under adverse\n            macroeconomic environment; 4) Continuity of task team\n            leadership and ensuring an adequate skill mix, contributes\n            positively to the outcomes of a project; and 5) For\n            successful monitoring and use of indicators, there needs to\n            be a periodic review of indicators to reflect current\n            country and Bank objectives.

The project consists of four components. 1)\n            Strengthening the road sector institutional framework will\n            support institutional development and changes in various\n            road sector agencies to accommodate the new sector policy\n            framework. It will also support capacity building and skills\n            development of road sector personnel for sustainable road\n            sector management. 2) Development of the construction and\n            consulting industries will support the establishment of the\n            National Construction Industry Council as the principal\n            stakeholder representative body for the development of the\n            local industry and will support the development and\n            implementation of action plans to address industry\n            constraints. 3) Support to sustainable periodic maintenance\n            will cover priority periodic maintenance requirements of the\n            core network to assure road infrastructure quality. 4)\n            Support to selective
