Some lessons learned included: ADS\n            (Agence de Developpement Social - Social Development Agency)\n            has repositioned its role in participatory diagnostic and\n            planning, capacity building of local actors, and income\n            generating activities. A clearer Government support for this\n            'niche' could help equip the agency with the\n            resources that will be needed to maximize its impact on\n            poverty. The social agenda is large and complex. Several\n            entities and/or programs can be the implementing vehicles\n            but their roles and responsibilities need to be\n            well-delineated, promoting coherence/complementary of\n            interventions and avoiding overlap. The lack of attention to\n            the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system during\n            preparation and the early stage of supervision prevent a\n            full assessment of the cost effectiveness of ADS'\n            approaches to community participation or capacity building\n            of local actors. A strengthened M&E system is also\n            necessary to produce the analysis that can justify ADS'\n            institutionalization in the territorial development/poverty\n            alleviation agenda by substantiating its areas of strengths.\n            To do so, it will be important that ADS quickly revise its\n            M&E framework and adapt it to its new areas of focus.\n            Finally, Bank technical support to the impact evaluation\n            should have been better planned to influence the quality of\n            the evaluation. Social fund projects should be supervised by\n            social fund specialists. This helps projects benefit from\n            all the knowledge on social funds accumulated by the Bank in\n            the last 20 years and from the tools that have been\n            developed. It ensures that critical dimensions of social\n            funds are not missed during supervision. The project\n            benefited from an excellent exposure to international\n            experience during preparation when the project was managed\n            by a social fund specialist, but less so during supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Support for the Social Development\n            Agency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Support for the Social\n

communities, and social\n            infrastructure, support economic infrastructure and income\n            generation, develop institutional capacity, and, provide\n            support to the institutional, and operational aspects,\n            through relevant studies. The potential for environmental\n            adversity lies basically during construction, and operation\n            of roads, schools, health care centers, and water supply,\n            and sanitation systems. This environmental management plan\n            stipulates that subprojects, with potentially irreversible\n            negative impacts, will not be approved for funding, namely,\n            those requiring terracing for a high percentage of slope\n            lands; those requiring deforestation, or affecting natural\n            habitats and biodiversity; those affecting cultural heritage\n            sites; and, those requiring the use of pesticides and\n            herbicides. Mitigation calls for measures as follows.\n            Ditches and outlets will be maintained to control clogging\n            of naturally damaged channels, while drainage facilities\n            will be functional to appropriately conduct storm water\n            drainage. Site locations should be selected for disposal of\n            excavated soil, and, re-vegetation practices along road\n            sides, etc., would combat erosion. Water contamination, and\n            degradation of water quality, will undergo regular quality\n            tests, surveyed according to local water regulations, and\n            management practices. Priority will be given to\n            rehabilitating toilets, and sanitary installations to\n            control improper wastes disposal, including medical wastes,\n            and to prevent water borne diseases. Aforestation through\n            new techniques, and the use of renewable energy sources,\n            will be introduced to control grazing, and deforestation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Social
