The Bank and\n            borrower performance were moderately satisfactory. The risk\n            to development outcome was moderate. Significant changes\n            included an extension of the closing date.   Several lessons\n            were learned. Emergency operations should be designed to be\n            as simple as possible, with clear and unambiguous\n            implementing arrangements, facilitating prompt\n            implementation. Emergency operations in a post conflict -\n            oil rich country should also provide a framework for\n            parallel finance. Emergency projects are designed to be\n            implemented quickly. An emergency operation is designed to\n            meet urgent and pressing needs and is usually implemented\n            within a period of 36 months. If there is a lengthy delay in\n            preparation or approval or effectiveness, consideration\n            should be given to converting the emergency operation into a\n            more traditional investment operation, focusing on the\n            emerging mid-term needs of the country. Key performance\n            indicators should always be designed to assess sector\n            performance, and should be well matched with the project\n            development objectives and adequately monitored during\n            project implementation. It is critical to reach agreement\n            with the client on a well-designed monitoring and evaluation\n            results framework.  The lack of a Midterm Review proved to\n            be a missed opportunity for adjustment.  Flexible,\n            innovative and coordinated responses are critical in a post\n            conflict-oil rich country where the Government can fund many\n            activities but lacks the planning and implementation expertise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - Emergency Multisector Recovery\n            Program Phase II"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Angola - Emergency Multisector\n
