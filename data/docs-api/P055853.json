Lessons learned from\n            the project: Privatizations are very difficult processes\n            that require strong political will to implement. Frequent\n            changes in leadership in the implementing agency can delay\n            reform processes in the institution.

The design,\n            and operations of a rural telecommunications development\n            fund will be supported, to provide incentives for private\n            investments, thus improving the sector's services in\n            those areas. The project components will: 1) strengthen\n            institutional capacity, and policy functions of the\n            Instituto Nicaraguense de Telecomunicaciones y Correos\n            (TELCOR), through: revision, and drafting of legal\n            amendments, and regulations; recommendation for\n            institutional changes, be it structural, managerial,\n            procedural and/or administrative; identification, and\n            provision of training needs; and, preparation for an action\n            plan; 2) establish new radio spectrum management, and\n            monitoring systems, assessing development needs, and,\n            procurement related issues; 3) create a rural\n            telecommunications development fund, by preparing the\n            strategy, and, analysis of legal and economic frameworks,\n            for financing the development of pilot community information\n            centers to service rural areas; 4) provide legal, and\n            financial technical assistance for the on-going\n            privatization of the Empresa Nicaraguense de\n            Telecomunicaciones (ENITEL); 5) provide management support\n            to the implementing agency; and, 6) upgrade software and\n            data systems in connection with Y2K problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Telecommunications Sector Reform
