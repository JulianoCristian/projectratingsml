In addition, despite\n            substantial institutional development, and satisfactory\n            performance by the Borrower, the Bank performance is rated\n            as marginally satisfactory, because supervision reporting\n            was incomplete, and little was done to support follow-up\n            funding generation. This is therefore the main lesson drawn\n            from this project. During the early stages of the pilot\n            phase of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), it was\n            implicitly assumed that environmental follow-up funding,\n            would supersede the initial GEF input to support maintenance\n            operations. However, this assumption proved incorrect,\n            therefore, after ten years of experience, it is now\n            suggested that GEF should review the possibility to ensure\n            long-term support to protect resources of high global\n            biodiversity value, considering a broader view of\n            biodiversity, and conservation issues. A more general review\n            on how to ensure sustainability of globally valuable\n            bio-resources, should be raised at the tenth anniversary of\n            the Rio Conference."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Belarus - Forest Biodiversity Protection Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Belarus - Forest Biodiversity\n            Protection Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/04/1089544/belarus-forest-biodiversity-protection-project","projn":"BY-Forest Biodiversity Protection Gef\n            Project -- P008290","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Tourism and Ecotourism,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Forestry,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Wetlands","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Belarus","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01042508503144"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            land,agriculture,air,biodiversity conservation,Biodiversity\n            Protection,biological resources,Biosphere,bogs,buffer\n            zone,conservation activities,conservation\n            issues,conservation of forests,drainage,Ecosystems\n            Biodiversity,Environmental Protection,farms,foreign\n            visitors,Forest,forest areas,Forest Biodiversity,Forest\n            Ecosystems,forest reserves,foresters,forestry,forestry\n            activities,forestry equipment,forests,Geographic\n            Information,hunting,hunting areas,media,National\n            Park,national parks,Natural Resources,NGOs,park\n            management,parks,pollution,preservation,professional\n            development,promotional materials,public\n            awareness,regeneration,Research\n            institutions,Sustainability,tourism,tourist,tourist\n            revenues,tourists,tree species,trees,wetland\n            ecosystems,wetlands,wetlands policy,wild boar,wildlife"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural\n            land,agriculture,air,biodiversity conservation,Biodiversity\n            Protection,biological resources,Biosphere,bogs,buffer\n            zone,conservation activities,conservation\n            issues,conservation of forests,drainage,Ecosystems\n            Biodiversity,Environmental Protection,farms,foreign\n            visitors,Forest,forest areas,Forest Biodiversity,Forest\n            Ecosystems,forest reserves,foresters,forestry,forestry\n            activities,forestry equipment,forests,Geographic\n            Information,hunting,hunting areas,media,National\n            Park,national parks,Natural Resources,NGOs,park\n            management,parks,pollution,preservation,professional\n            development,promotional materials,public\n            awareness,regeneration,Research\n            institutions,Sustainability,tourism,tourist,tourist\n            revenues,tourists,tree species,trees,wetland\n            ecosystems,wetlands,wetlands policy,wild boar,wildlife"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF028621-GET-BELARUS BIODIVERSITY PROJECT","repnb":"22073"},"727936":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/06/727936/belarus-forest-biodiversity-protection-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/06/727936/belarus-forest-biodiversity-protection-project","new_url":"1998/06/727936/belarus-forest-biodiversity-protection-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/03/000094946_99030406204747/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/03/000094946_99030406204747/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","datestored":"2000-03-03T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1998-06-11T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Belarus - Forest Biodiversity Protection Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall outcome of the project is\n            rated as satisfactory. The key lessons learned are: a) The\n            social assessment component of the management plan conducted\n            in the last year of the project revealed that public\n            awareness of the project objectives and activities was weak.\n            Local residents valued the park's conservation\n            objectives and would be more supportive of the national park\n            if they received some of the benefits. As a result, the\n            national park is improving its communication with local\n            communities. Participation of local communities would have\n            been more successful if the social assessment had been\n            conducted earlier in the project. b) The project was\n            strongly oriented to achieving results, especially in\n            technical subjects. The project design could have been\n            improved by identifying discrete results to be achieved at\n            different stages of the project, and used as measures of\n            success. c) Professional development and training activities\n            were an important ingredient of the project's success.\n            d) Early in the project, a needs assessment of the Project\n            Managing Unit could have identified the need for training in\n            the office management and business skills needed to\n            implement the project.
