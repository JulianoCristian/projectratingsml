Its institutional development\n            impact is rated as moderate. Due to pending institutional\n            improvements and the Borrower's still relatively weak\n            financial situation, project sustainability is rated as\n            uncertain. The Bank's performance in the formulation of\n            the physical aspects of the project was satisfactory.\n            However, the design and appraisal of institutional aspects\n            of the project were inadequate. The Borrower executed the\n            physical investment program satisfactorily. However, the\n            Borrower's performance in the institutional and\n            financial performance was unsatisfactory. The project mostly\n            achieved, and in some cases exceeded, its physical targets.\n            Achievements were mixed on the financial and institutional\n            fronts. Overall project implementation was satisfactory, and\n            most components were achieved ahead of the original\n            schedule. Project completion was, however, extended by\n            fifteen months due to the inclusion of additional work in\n            the project and delays in the Government approval of a\n            revised project proforma prepared to accommodate the\n            revisions. The main lessons learned are: (a) institutional\n            support needs to be clearly linked to institutional\n            objectives and specific components to have any significant\n            impact; (b) poor initial progress caused in part by the\n            delay in the appointment of consultants could have been\n            avoided if such appointments and designs for the first year\n            works had been ready by Board Presentation; (c) the\n            Borrower's inability to comply with financial covenants\n            was partly due to the lack of clear linkage between\n            financial and institutional development components in the\n            project and the covenants; and (d) lack of autonomy,\n            accountability, and responsibility within the Borrower\n            adversely affected its efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -

   strengthening of sectoral training and planning.  It aims to\n            achieve them through:  implementation of a large-scale leak\n            detection program to reduce leakage and unaccounted-for\n            water; installation of a computer system in DWASA for\n            commercial management and monitoring of operations; and a\n            study of DWASA staff productivity and deployment of staff\n            resources.  The project further supports expansion of water\n            supply and sewerage facilities; rehabilitation of old water\n            mains; and a pilot low-cost sanitation program.  Lastly,\n            this venture provides for the resettlement of residents at\n            Demra if necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Third Dhaka Water Supply and\n            Sanitation
