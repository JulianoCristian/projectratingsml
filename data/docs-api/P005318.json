The ESAL objectives covered: (a) energy pricing - to\n            rationalize prices and improve sector finances; (b) sector\n            restructuring - to improve the institutional and legislative\n            framework for: (i) corporate commercial operations in the\n            power and oil and gas subsectors; (ii) separate and\n            transparent regulation of the power subsector; (iii)\n            competition among power entitiies(; iv) private sector\n            investmenta nd participationi n power generationa nd\n            distribution; and (v) sector policy formulation and\n            planning; (c) environmental protection - to improve\n            environmental guidelines and regulations for the energy\n            sector and designate a monitoring and enforcement authority;\n            and (d) energy conservation - to improve electricity demand\n            management, power plant efficiency, and end-use energy\n            conservation. Overall, Bank performance was rated as\n            satisfactory. Borrower Performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned in this project were as follows: (i) the\n            presence of strong, up-front borrower ownership to the\n            reform agenda is of major importance for effective\n            implementation; (ii) institutional arrangements need to be\n            clearly defined and bought into by appraisal; (iii) single\n            tranche adjustment operations may be more effective lending\n            instruments for adjustment operations involving\n            institutional reforms; and (iv) the availability of\n            concurrent technical assistance can be critical to the\n            effective implementation of sector adjustment operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Energy Sector Adjustment Loan
