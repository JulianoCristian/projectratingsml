The\n            request for inspection was submitted by individuals from\n            Sengwer communities who live, and represent other members\n            who live, in four areas of the Cherangany hills in the\n            western highlands of Kenya, namely the Kapolet forest (in\n            Trans-Nzoia county), Talau and Kaipos (in West Pokot\n            county), and Embobut forest (in Marakwet county). The\n            requesters claimed that they had been forcibly evicted from\n            their lands within the forests as a result of the project,\n            and that there had been a lack of recognition and protection\n            of their customary rights during project implementation. The\n            Panel determined that no evictions were supported by the\n            NRMP, but more attention should have been given from the\n            outset to identify risks for affected people and adequately\n            mitigate such risks as required by Bank policies on\n            environmental assessment, project appraisal, indigenous\n            peoples, and involuntary resettlement.

Some lessons learned included: the\n            project offers a number of lessons on institutions,\n            investments, information and implementation for future GOK\n            programming and external financial support to natural\n            resources and the sectors it drives or helps protect.

The first request, submitted on\n            January 2, 2013, was sent by members of the Sengwer\n            Indigenous community from four areas of the Cherangany Hills\n            in the Western Highlands of Kenya; the second one, submitted\n            on June 28, 2013, was sent by four representatives of the\n            Cherangany indigenous people's community on behalf of\n            people living in the Cherangany hills. The two requests\n            address overlapping issues.

On\n            January 14, 2013, the Inspection Panel received a request\n            for inspection related to the Natural Resource Management\n            Project for Kenya. According to the request, Kenya Forest\n            Service (KFS) has burned over 500 houses and property in\n            Empoput forest since 2007 in the process of carrying out\n            forceful evictions. The Requesters state that the Empoput\n            forest is part of the ancestral land of the Sengwer people\n            as an ethnic minority hunter-gatherer people. The Requesters\n            state that second phase and the demarcation of Sengwer land\n            was stopped so 97 Sengwer families who were to be settled\n            under second phase moved to the land that belonged to them\n            but were arrested and charged with encroachment in the\n            forest. The Request indicates that this case related to\n            arrested community members is pending in the Kitale courts\n            since 2009 and has cost the communities hundreds of\n            thousands of Kenya Shillings in legal fees and other\n            expenses. The Request concludes with a number of\n            recommendations including; that the Government recognizes\n            the rights of the Sengwer to live in their ancestral home in\n            Kapolet and Empoput forest, and that it compensates the\n            families whose houses and property were destroyed, and those\n            who were arrested in Kapolet and the woman who was shot."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Natural Resource Management Project\n            : inspection panel report and recommendation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Natural Resource\n
