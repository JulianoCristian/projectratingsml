Since project approval in October 1999,\n            implementation was hampered by two main events. First, there\n            was delay in project effectiveness. The project was\n            originally scheduled to become effective in January 2000 but\n            did not become effective until February 2001. Second, not\n            long after project effectiveness, in May 2001 the Government\n            declared a major energy supply crisis which significantly\n            dampened the incentives for distribution companies to\n            execute the proposed project activities. There are two main\n            lessons from the project that should be used in subsequent\n            World Bank energy efficiency projects. (1) Demand-side\n            management (DSM) programs can be successful only if the\n            underlying incentives of the regulatory framework are in\n            place and correct. (2) The rationing program that was put in\n            place in 2002 to deal with severe cuts in electricity supply\n            was effective in reducing consumption, but also resulted in\n            large financial losses to the distribution utilities that\n            have been being made up through utility bills since the crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

The first phase is to demonstrate cost-effective\n            measures in the electricity sub-sector through load\n            management and targeted peak period reductions so as to\n            better utilize existing facilities; demonstrate the same to\n            reduce energy use in public, residential, commercial, and\n            industrial facilities; enhance standards and labeling\n            programs; and set up a market-based support structure for\n            energy service companies. Project components will consist of\n            Demonstration Projects as follows: 1) Proper electricity\n            price signals and service options will target selected\n            electricity energy markets to test and demonstrate\n            innovative demand charge and time-of-day-tariffs, load\n            demand limiters, options in service conditions, and other\n            commercial actions. 2) Delivery mechanisms for dissemination\n            of emerging technologies will test delivery mechanisms to\n            increase the use of more efficient appliances, equipment,\n            and operational practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
