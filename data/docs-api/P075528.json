HIV/AIDS Prevention\n            and Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Trinidad and Tobago has completed a\n            major assessment of the level of HIV/AIDS infection in the\n            country, and an analysis of the social, cultural, political\n            and economic risks associated with the spread of the\n            epidemic. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has set two\n            overarching and strategic goals: (a) To reduce the incidence\n            of HIV infections; and to mitigate the negative impact of\n            HIV/AIDS on persons infected and affected i(PLWA).. The\n            activities are grouped into 5 components, similar to the 5\n            priority areas contemplated in the Five-Year National\n            HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (2003-2007). These components would\n            apply to Trinidad, Tobago or both: Component 1 helps prevent\n            the spread of HIV/AIDS by promoting behavioral change. It\n            intensifies education and heightens awareness, targets\n            high-risk groups, and improves the availability and\n            accessibility of condoms. This component also supports\n            interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission,\n            supports a national voluntary testing and counseling (VCT)\n            program, which includes the establishment of private VCT\n            sites; provides diagnosis, treatment, and counseling for\n            sexually transmitted diseases; improves biomedical waste\n            management; and finances technical assistance for blood bank\n            and transfusion services. Component 2 finances the\n            installation capacity for HIV testing in selected health\n            centers, as well as in all Enhanced Health Centers and\n            District Health Centers (DHC); finances the construction of\n            new buildings ; purchases equipment; trains medical staff\n            and lab staff in diagnosiing  HIV/AIDS and opportunistic\n            infections; upgrades pharmacy service infrastructures;\n            trains pharmacy staff and funds training manuals for home\n            care. Component 3 supports drafting legislation in relation\n            to discrimination against PLWA in the workplace. Consultants\n            will review the legislation and make recommendations as to\n            the amendments of such legislation and/or propose\n            legislation which may be needed. The project will also\n            finance nongovernmental organization services for planning\n            and implementing positive advocacy campaigns. Component 4\n            supports the implementation of standardized protocols for\n            behavioral (\"second generation\") and biological\n            surveillance. It also provides technical assistance required\n            for the selection, acquisition, adaptation and\n            implementation of clinical information systems; sexual risk;\n            behavior surveys; HIV/AIDS surveillance training;\n            information technology training; LAN installation, hubs,\n            UPS, communications; servers, work stations and operational\n            software; scanners and printers; broad band installation\n            & annual service; research proposed by national and\n            regional agencies. Lastly, Component 5 supports the\n            establishment and initial operations of a sustainable\n            institutional structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Trinidad & Tobago - HIV/AIDS Prevention\n
