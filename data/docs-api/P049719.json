Lessons learned\n            include: a single implementation agency for land\n            administration has operational advantages over a dual or\n            multi-agency approach. As the sole agency responsible for\n            land administration it was easier for Gosregister to\n            coordinate cadastral and registration activities, to reduce\n            bottlenecks, and to improve efficiency. The project's\n            success can be attributed in part to several design factors:\n            (a) the implementing agency and supporting legislation were\n            established before project implementation; (b) the project\n            prioritized development of a trained cadre of professional\n            staff; and (c) large-scale or complex activities were\n            introduced in phases. Gosregister could commence operations\n            immediately. Major training built staff proficiency in all\n            key skills. The network of registration offices and the\n            digitization and information technology systems were\n            developed progressively in line with evolving management and\n

as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) the project\n            confirms a number of recognized lessons with respect to\n            lending. Foremost among these is the importance of\n            Government ownership and commitment over the long term which\n            were evident in identification of a true champion for\n            implementation of the project and further, stability over\n            time of a qualified and high-performing management team.\n            Continuity of staff was also important on the Bank's\n            side. This approach was deeply appreciated by the borrower\n            and allowed for building and maintaining a relationship of\n            trust that was an important part of the project's\n            success; 2) the LRERP also serves to confirm findings on the\n            advantages of a single agency model for handling\n            registration and cadastre, and to approach these\n            interventions through stand-alone projects rather than as\n            components in larger projects; 3) the project reconfirmed\n            the importance of a good monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            program. For a project such as this with multiple points of\n            service provision to the population, this could not have\n            been accomplished, even in a country of relatively small\n            scale as the Kyrgyz Republic, without the use of regional\n            monitors and the insistence that those monitors spend their\n            time in the field; and 4) the benefits of the project were\n            and are wider than the direct benefits of achieving the\n            project development objective (PDO). The well recognized\n            success of this intervention had a positive impact on the\n            broader Bank-Borrower relationship and on the reputation of\n            the Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic. Further, it is useful as a\n            model of success for land registration and land\n            administration projects more broadly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Land and Real Estate\n

Among impacts\n            identified: Prevent loss of biodiversity and cultural\n            features by avoiding priority protection areas and areas of\n            little or no cultural significance. Select locations where\n            noise, odor, or aesthetic nuisance to neighborhoods will be\n            reduced. To reduce soil erosion, ensure worker awareness,\n            adopt appropriate soil protection techniques, avoid exposing\n            soil surfaces, conserve topsoil, and recover and replant,\n            and landscape where appropriate when construction is\n            completed. To minimize loss of soil productivity and\n            contaminating groundwater, train workers in handling and\n            storing fuels, lubricants, and chemicals; provide proper\n            on-site storage facilities; and install toilets and transfer\n            waste to municipal treatment facility. Operate during\n            working hours only, and water access roads during dry\n            periods to cut down on noise and dust. Dispose of\n            construction waste and garbage at designated sites. Ensure\n            that local people are aware of restricted access and arrange\n            for alternatives. Instruct workers on safety, use signage,\n            and barricade exposed areas. Provide protective clothing,\n            effective use of disinfectants, and conduct sanitary\n            inspections according to standards, including regulatory\n            animal and meat inspection. Ground waste bone, meat , and\n            offal into flour for animal feed, use blood for blood\n            sausage, collect and treat other water and blood waste\n            before disposing into municipal waste treatment systems,\n            recycle manure and allow to mature in an impervious\n            containment, apply manure as fertilizer for crop production\n            or on pastures. Properly apply pesticides. Remove and\n            recycle or effectively dispose of all toxic materials,\n            complete demolition after recycling useful materials, and\n            remove to a designated environmentally safe disposal site\n            and bury clean and inert materials. Avoid escaping NH3,\n            maintain sanitary conditions, and dispose of manure in a\n            timely manner to reduce odors. Convert refrigerants from\n            ozone depleting substances to a hydrofluorocarbon. To\n            prevent groundwater depletion, apportion water and use\n            efficiently. To reduce impacts from lead (lead solder used\n            for can seams), use tin instead or adopt other appropriate\n            sealing methods. To lessen risk to toxic chemicals modifying\n            aquatic habitats, contain and treat effluent discharges, and\n            store chemicals to prevent spills. To reduce surface water\n            contamination, collect and treat whey (waste from cheese\n            making) before discharge, and use for feedstock. To prevent\n            food contamination, know origin of milk, use effective\n            pasteurization process, conduct veterinary inspections, wear\n            protective gear, and disinfect. Regularly inspecting\n            markets, exterminating vermin, refrigerating meat and dairy\n            products will prevent spread of disease and worker illness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz

A\n            training program will be established for the promotion of\n            real estate markets, and, a long-term training program will\n            be established to foresee future needs of the State Agency\n            for Registration, and of a private professional capacity in\n            land, and real estate markets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic -
