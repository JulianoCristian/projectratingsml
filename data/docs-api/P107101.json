The\n            implementing agencies must also be made aware of the\n            damaging consequences of withholding payment approval at\n            length, far beyond the time that the contractor had been led\n            to expect (with reasonable safety margins) when he prepared\n            his bid. Traffic management and the planning of access for\n            the contractor's crews and equipment is very important\n            in any project involving works to upgrade crowded city\n            streets. The arguments for pre-qualification versus\n            post-qualification need to be weighed carefully when the\n            procurement plan is developed. In difficult work\n            environments like this one it is imperative to locate the\n            core members of the Bank's project team in the country.\n            This will significantly improve communication with the\n            client and other players in the project, provide hands-on\n            guidance to the client and other parties, and address issues\n            as they
