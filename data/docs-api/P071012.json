Lessons\n            learned include: fiscal sustainability of rapid expansion of\n            secondary education needs to be reassessed carefully within\n            the realistic context of limited fiscal resources and\n            competing needs of other education subsectors. The\n            unprecedented rate of expansion of community secondary\n            schools is putting extreme pressure on the education budget.\n            In recent years the government responded by reducing per\n            unit resources which in turn compromises the quality of\n            secondary education. Finding the financial resources to\n            complete the job of building quality into the expanded\n            system is an enormous challenge to be resolved by the\n            government and development partners. Rapid expansion of\n            secondary education is more complex and difficult than\n            rapidly expanding primary education. Secondary education\n            systems have subject specialties requiring efficient\n            matching of student class streams and teachers; teacher\n            shortages and lack of capacity limit the ability to increase\n            the number of teachers of appropriate qualifications\n            rapidly; curriculum, textbooks, and examinations need to be\n            reformed simultaneously; and the management challenge\n            inherent in rapid expansion and reform simultaneously would\n            tax even the most capable systems of education. The labor\n            market situation warrants closer and careful monitoring as\n            the supply of secondary school leavers is increasing. There\n            is a risk of creating an increasing pool of unemployed\n            secondary graduates as a consequence of the overly rapid\n            expansion of relatively low quality community secondary schools."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Human Resource Development Pilot\n            Project, Primary Education Development Program Project, and\n            Secondary Education
