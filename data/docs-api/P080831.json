The\n            overall rating for all the four projects is rated as\n            satisfactory in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)\n            rating, and also the performance of the Bank and the\n            Borrower for all four projects is rated as satisfactory. The\n            main lessons learned from this review are: (i) as noted in\n            Independent Evaluation Group (IEG's) ICR Review of\n            Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loan (FIAL III), project\n            design needs to be clearly aligned with its development\n            objectives in order to attain the latter. Even if the\n            structural deficit of the central administration is\n            \"highly sensitive and political\" as the ICR\n            states, the magnitudes of these structural rigidities were\n            such that they must be addressed if progress is to be made\n            in achieving the substantial fiscal adjustment that is\n            required for sustained macroeconomic stability; (ii) loans\n            with large numbers of objectives and conditions, and\n            involving too many institutions relative to the management\n            capacity of the Government and the Bank itself, overtax the\n            implementation capacity of both the Bank and the borrower\n            and result in poor execution; (iii) the inclusion of\n            objectives of widely different levels of priority and weak\n            connection with the ultimate goals of the operations tends\n            to obscure the degree of attainment of the latter; and (iv)\n            success depends on the borrower's ownership of the\n            objectives of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Structural Fiscal Adjustment; and\n            First, Second,

- Programmatic Fiscal and\n            Institutional Structural Adjustment Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Programmatic Fiscal and\n            Institutional Structural Adjustment Loan (FIAL) Project for\n            Colombia is the first of four loans using a Programmatic\n            Structural Adjustment Loan (PSAL) instrument. It will\n            support the first phase of the constitutional referendum;\n            the enactment of the tax reform law; modernization of the\n            tax administration; improvement of budget management with\n            modern tools and legal reforms; prevent massive losses to\n            the State from judicial claims; strengthen the public sector\n            procurement system; improve performance through management\n            contract for government agencies; promote the development of\n            a sound fiscal responsibility legal framework; support a\n            coherent and comprehensive reform implementation process;\n            and the initial measures that comprise the building blocks\n            for subsequent public sector reform initiatives supported by\n            the overall program. A single tranche amount of US$300\n            Million will be disbursed in March 2003. The timing of the\n            first loan is calibrated to support the government efforts\n            to deliver an immediate confidence building signal to the\n            markets through major reforms that have recently been\n            approved or are being implemented. On balance consequently,\n            the FIAL is judged to be a high-risk, high-return project.\n            Therefore, it is essential to maintain a close working\n            relationship with the Government of Colombia, and to provide\n            ample, ongoing dialogue and assistance during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Programmatic Fiscal and\n            Institutional
