Rwanda - Burundi interconnected system; and\n            (c) strengthen Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL)\n            as an institution.  These objectives will be achieved\n            through several methods.  The first will be accomplished by\n            (i) rehabilitating the existing Ruzizi I plant and the\n            distribution networks of (a); (ii) completing the\n            rehabilitation of the generation stations and transmission\n            and distribution system in the Shaba Region; and (iii)\n            carrying out urgent maintenance works and improving\n            operation of the Inga hydropower complex.  Secondly, optimal\n            use of electric energy will be achieved through increasing\n            the transmission and distribution capacity of the\n            electricity network in that portion of the Kivu region where\n            there is considerable suppressed demand. Finally, SNEL will\n            be strengthened through better planning, rational pricing,\n            improved financial policies and training of its staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Second Power

- Second Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Through this Second Power Project, Zaire\n            hopes to (a) ensure a reliable supply of electrical energy\n            to the main interconnected networks of Bukavu, Goma, Uvira\n            and Kiliba; (b) make use of the electric energy within the\n            Zaire (Kivu) - Rwanda - Burundi interconnected system; and\n            (c) strengthen Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL)\n            as an institution.  These objectives will be achieved\n            through several methods.  The first will be accomplished by\n            (i) rehabilitating the existing Ruzizi I plant and the\n            distribution networks of (a); (ii) completing the\n            rehabilitation of the generation stations and transmission\n            and distribution system in the Shaba Region; and (iii)\n            carrying out urgent maintenance works and improving\n            operation of the Inga hydropower complex.  Secondly, optimal\n            use of electric energy will be achieved through increasing\n            the transmission and distribution capacity of the\n            electricity network in that portion of the Kivu region where\n            there is considerable suppressed demand. Finally, SNEL will\n            be strengthened through better planning, rational pricing,\n            improved financial policies and training of its staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Second Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire - Second Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/05/739825/zaire-second-power-project","projn":"ZR-Power Ii-267751 -- P003054","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,National Governance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970625092731"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,assets,Authority,authorization,balance\n            of payments,Bank loans,borrowing,budget deficit,budget\n            surplus,budgetary expenditures,budgetary funds,budgetary\n            resources,budgetary support,capital flows,Central\n            Bank,coal,competitive bidding,consumers,copper\n            smelters,debt,debt\n            relief,deforestation,deposits,devaluation,Economic\n            Change,Economic conditions,economic growth,economic\n            justification,Economic Rate of Return,economic\n            situation,employment,energy consumption,exchange\n            rate,execution,expenditure,expenditures,exploitation,export\n            growth,exports,financial assistance,financial\n            crisis,financial discipline,financial management,financial\n            performance,financial policies,financial\n            resources,FISCAL,fiscal management,fiscal revenues,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,foreign exchange market,foreign\n            investment,forestry,fuels,furnaces,GDP,GNP,GNP per\n            capita,Government agencies,Government\n            intervention,government ministries,growth\n            rate,imports,income,inflation,institution\n            building,institutional reform,institutional\n            weaknesses,interest rates,intermediate goods,investment\n            expenditures,investment spending,London Club,"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agriculture,assets,Authority,authorization,balance\n            of payments,Bank loans,borrowing,budget deficit,budget\n            surplus,budgetary expenditures,budgetary funds,budgetary\n            resources,budgetary support,capital flows,Central\n            Bank,coal,competitive bidding,consumers,copper\n            smelters,debt,debt\n            relief,deforestation,deposits,devaluation,Economic\n            Change,Economic conditions,economic growth,economic\n            justification,Economic Rate of Return,economic\n            situation,employment,energy consumption,exchange\n            rate,execution,expenditure,expenditures,exploitation,export\n            growth,exports,financial assistance,financial\n            crisis,financial discipline,financial management,financial\n            performance,financial policies,financial\n            resources,FISCAL,fiscal management,fiscal revenues,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,foreign exchange market,foreign\n            investment,forestry,fuels,furnaces,GDP,GNP,GNP per\n            capita,Government agencies,Government\n            intervention,government ministries,growth\n            rate,imports,income,inflation,institution\n            building,institutional reform,institutional\n            weaknesses,interest rates,intermediate goods,investment\n            expenditures,investment spending,London Club,"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P4334"},"facets":{}}}
