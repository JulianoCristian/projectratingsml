(b) it is vital for the above mentioned microcatchment\n            area-based projects to create and/or strengthen beneficiary\n            organizations at the local and regional level and to involve\n            local governments and organized civil society to leverage\n            commitment to and sustainability of the process and\n            benefits; (c) the highly participatory and more\n            interdisciplinary microcatchment area-based approach was\n            more effective in building both social capital and community\n            awareness and involvement with the management of natural\n            resources while the more limited menu CDD style approach\n            remained more focused on collective productive and small\n            agro-processing endeavors than on natural resources\n            management activities; (d) when working with indigenous\n            groups, it is critical to work with and strengthen\n            indigenous organizations, respecting the culturally-defined\n            decision-making mechanisms of each ethnic group; (e)\n            projects greatly benefit when the policy framework guiding\n            the process remains stable; (f) the simplest and most\n            effective project implementation arrangements and\n            institutional set-up, consistent with the development\n            objective and the actual institutional set-up, should be\n            utilized for projects that address complex problems via\n            relatively weak institutions; (g) it is very important to\n            develop efficient and effective monitoring and results-based\n            impact indicators for multi-disciplinary projects such as\n            the microcatchment area-based approach whose objectives span\n            many technical and institutional domains; and (h) it is\n            crucial to establish strict criteria for targeting\n            beneficiaries and areas, as well as clear and transparent\n            eligibility criteria and decision-making processes, to\n            allocate resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Natural Resources Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Natural Resources\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/12/7323069/paraguay-natural-resources-management-project","projn":"PY-Natural Resources Management Project -- P007918","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Population Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"Paraguay","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070116113800"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services,Micro- and SME finance,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Finance,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adult education, Agricultural Development,\n            agricultural output, agricultural practices, agricultural\n            production, Agricultural Research, Agriculture, basic\n            infrastructure, basic sanitation, Biodiversity, biodiversity\n            conservation, capacity building, child care, Community\n            Development, conditionality, crops, cultural realities,\n            decentralization, decentralization of authority,\n            deforestation, diseases, economic analysis, education goals,\n            educational activities, effective strategy, environmental,\n            Environmental Conservation, environmental degradation,\n            Environmental Education, environmental impact, environmental\n            issues, environmental problems, environmental protection,\n            equipment, Exchange Rate, expenditures, Extension, families,\n            farmers, Farms, financial resources, fishing, food\n            processing, forestry, Gender, Global Environment, health\n            education, health services, health workers, income,\n            income-generating activities, incomes, indigenous people,\n            Indigenous Peoples, indigenous populations, Information\n            System, institutional capacity, knowledge base, land tenure,\n            land use, laws, legal status, legislation, Livestock, local\n            authorities, local development, Local governments, local\n            population, marketing, Ministry of Education, Ministry of\n            Health, mother, national level, Natural Resource, Natural\n            Resource Management, natural resource problems, NATURAL\n            RESOURCES, NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, NGOs, nutrition,\n            participation of communities, participatory approaches,\n            political instability, Present Value, primary education,\n            producers, productivity, progress, Quality Assurance,\n            regional organizations, resource conservation, resource\n            limitations, resource protection, RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,\n            respect, rural communities, Rural Development, rural\n            infrastructure, Rural Welfare, screening, smallholders,\n            Social Development, social services, soils, strategic\n            priorities, Sustainable Development, sustainable management,\n            technical assistance, watershed"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF020071-AUSTRALIAN SOUTH PACIFIC\n            FACILITY (USD),TF020615-PHRD-NATURAL RESOURCE MGMT.
