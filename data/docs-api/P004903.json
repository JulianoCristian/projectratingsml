Some of the lessons\n            learned from the project are: a) the outcome of this project\n            suggests that the design was flawed from the beginning. The\n            components were too large and complex, and too difficult to\n            implement and manage given the institutional capacity in the\n            country. In addition, Algeria's attempts at sector\n            reform lacked political will at the time of project\n            implementation. In the future, necessary sector reforms\n            should be in place before projects are approved and\n            implemented; b) urban water supply projects should not be\n            supported by the Bank without proper commitment of the\n            Borrower to carry out their objectives within a clear\n            strategic framework for sector development. Therefore,\n            future lending in the sector should be directly linked to\n            the implementation performance of ongoing projects; and c)\n            the Bank should be proactive in problem solving as part of\n            its supervision, and should mobilize teams with a high level\n            of expertise and experience to assist the Borrower with\n            difficult issues. When appropriate, these issues should\n            receive active input from Bank management. The availability\n            of such resources and commitment by the Bank will help the\n            Borrower to achieve much-needed success in projects in this sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Second National Water Supply and\n            Sewerage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Second National Water\n            Supply and Sewerage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/04/731733/algeria-second-national-water-supply-sewerage-project","projn":"DZ-Nat.
