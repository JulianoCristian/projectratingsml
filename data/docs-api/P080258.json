Negative impacts most commonly include:\n            dust and noise due to excavation, demolition and\n            construction; management of demolition construction wastes\n            and accidental spillage of machine oil, lubricants, etc.,\n            encroachment to a private property, damage to historical or\n            cultural property or unknown archaeological sites, traffic\n            disturbance, surface or ground water, and soil pollution or\n            erosion. Mitigation measures include: 1) the local\n            construction and environment inspectorates and communities\n            have been notified of upcoming activities; 2) during\n            interior demolition use debris chutes above the first floor;\n            3) there will be no open burning of construction/waste\n            material at the site; 4) during operations the engine covers\n            of generators, air compressors and other powered mechanical\n            equipment should be closed, and equipment placed as far away\n            from residential areas as possible; 5) the site will\n            establish appropriate erosion and sediment control measures;\n            6) waste collection and disposal pathways and sites will be\n            identified for all major waste types expected from\n            demolition and construction activities; 7) monitoring of new\n            wastewater systems (before/after) will be carried out; and\n            8) special facilities for segregated healthcare waste."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Second Science and Technology\n            Project : environmental management

- Science and Technology Project (STP)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Science and Technology\n            Project (STP) for Croatia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            first lesson learned from the STP is that innovation related\n            projects may achieve tangible results within a relative\n            short time. STP achievements indicate that Croatia's\n            innovation performance was not constrained by a lack of\n            ideas, as sometimes argued, but by the availability of\n            appropriate institutions, such as Technology Transfer\n            Organizations (TTOs), early-stage financing and mentoring\n            services. A second lesson derives from factors seemingly\n            critical for STP achievement focus on well defined,\n            quantifiable targets (enabling commercialization of publicly\n            funded research and supporting Small and Medium Size\n            Enterprises, or SME investments in Research and Development,\n            or R&D). A third lesson can be learned from what STP\n            could not achieve, namely: restructuring research institutes\n            and promoting a venture capital industry. The failure in\n            fostering restructuring of research organizations was caused\n            by a combination of political and technical difficulties.\n            While a complex political economy is to some extent inherent\n            to any restructuring process, a technical difficulty found\n            in STP was related to definition of the own concept of\n            restructuring, as BI did not count with direct government\n            support and was financially self-sustained. Finally, a\n            fourth lesson relates to sustainability of achieved results.\n            By the end of the project, funds for continuation of the\n            newly created programs had not been secured. The legal\n            status of Business Innovation Centre of Croatia (BICRO) and\n            Unity through Knowledge Fund (UKF) is currently being\n            reviewed by the new administration. TTOs still have to fully\n            integrate with their parent organizations (RBI and\n            Universities of Zagreb and Rijeka) and are currently\n            struggling to finance operating costs. Solutions, however,\n            are envisaged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Science and Technology Project (STP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - Science and Technology\n
