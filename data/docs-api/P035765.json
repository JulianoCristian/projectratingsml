Lessons\n            emphasize the importance of strong counterparts to achieve\n            success, exemplified by the Armenia Road Directorate's\n            leadership, and excellent judgment in selecting experienced\n            staff in road technology, well prepared, and qualified to\n            assimilate Bank guidelines, and operational methods.

However,\n            the persistent inadequacy of funding for road maintenance\n            within the budgetary process - even when road user charges\n            generate adequate income - suggests the Bank should review\n            the institutional, legal, public acceptance, and planning\n            issues, to determine, if a road tariff could replace the\n            road user charge part of the excise tax on fuel, for such a\n            tariff could establish a level playing field, to ensure\n            predictable road budgets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia -

preserve the\n            Armenian national road network and reduce transport\n            operating costs by expanding maintenance operations,\n            including bridge and tunnel rehabilitation; 2) help develop\n            an institutional framework adapted to the requirements of\n            the road sector of a market economy; 3) expand the resource\n            base for road maintenance by encouraging appropriate road\n            user charges; and 4) assist in developing an effective\n            private road construction and engineering industry; and 5)\n            improve road safety. The project components are: 1) periodic\n            highway maintenance; 2) bridges and tunnels; 3) materials\n            for routine maintenance; 4) equipment and spare parts; 5)\n            institutional strengthening and technical upgrading; and 6)\n            project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia -
