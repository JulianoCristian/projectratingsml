Some lessons learned\n            includes: developing systems requires taking informed risks.\n            At the start, there did not appear to be significant threats\n            to the development outcomes, from the perspective of policy\n            or strategy. In order to ensure value for money and control\n            corruption risks the focus needs to be on strengthening\n            Government systems, and particularly on risk based\n            approaches in financial management, procurement and auditing\n            systems. Sector-Wide Approach (SWAps) must include a strong\n            focus on governance and accountability. This can be achieved\n            by including measures relating to social accountability,\n            transparency, societal participation and a well-functioning\n            whistle-blowing policy and procedures, particularly to\n            ensure sufficient financing for them during implementation.\n            Greater reliance should be given to civil society\n            organizations in monitoring progress in the sector and in\n            implementing accountability measures. The appraisal of\n            country sector plans should be strengthened to ensure the\n            inclusion of appropriate results measurement indicators and\n            to set realistic targets. Bank projects supporting SWAps\n            could then use the same indicators and targets to measure\n            project results. Credible, robust and independent\n            information and data should guide the design,\n            implementation, and financing of a SWAp. Putting in place a\n            series of impact evaluations during Program implementing can\n            help to progressively develop informed policy decisions\n            about scaling up specific interventions as was done in the\n            case of the program. It is important to match up the program\n            structure with the budget structure and to be able to\n            monitor total expenditures on priority programs. Finally,\n            working in a sector-wide approach that aims to utilize\n            country systems requires strong, sustained and effective\n            collaboration across the World Bank country team."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Education Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Education Sector Support
