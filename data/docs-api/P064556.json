The lessons learned indicate that the credit\n            served as an effective instrument during the emergency and\n            early post-conflict phases in Burundi. It assisted in\n            jump-starting a failing economy, stimulated the private\n            sector and helped the government provide essential social\n            services (especially in education, health and agriculture)\n            and to cope with the resettlement of displaced persons and\n            returning refugees. It likely helped demonstrate to a wider\n            public that the peaceful settlement of conflict was not\n            leading instead to greater misery among the\n            non-participants. The economic, political and social returns\n            accruing from investment in such activities in a\n            post-conflict country is considerable, especially in\n            Burundi, where the total collapse of the economy seemed\n            imminent, due to risks associated with an extremely fragile\n            and volatile political environment. However, in order to be\n            effective, project design and implementation needed to be\n            sensitive to the prevailing circumstances. The most\n            important lesson emerging from the project is that in a\n            crisis situation where the atmosphere of insecurity was\n            pervasive, the degree of flexibility and devolution of\n            responsibilities adopted at design stage of the project\n            cycle greatly facilitated project implementation. The need\n            to pay particular attention to \"poverty\n            alleviation\" components of post-conflict programs\n            cannot be overemphasized. The Bank's requirement to\n            include these as an integral part of any program proved\n            beneficial in the case of Burundi."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Emergency Economic
