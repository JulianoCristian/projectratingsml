The West African Gas Pipeline Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall outcome rating of the West\n            African Gas Pipeline Project for Ghana was judged to be\n            moderately satisfactory. The Bank and borrower performance\n            ratings were moderately satisfactory. The risk to\n            development outcome was moderate.  Several lessons were\n            learned.  For cross-border energy projects, both supply-side\n            and demand side risks need to be carefully assessed and\n            their potential impact quantified. Risk analysis should\n            typically go beyond those faced by the private partners, and\n            should focus directly on the specific risks to the project\n            development objectives.  Careful assessment of political,\n            community, and social issues in large infrastructure\n            investments should be considered and identified and\n            adequately taken into account. The institutional framework\n            for large multi-country projects, like the West African Gas\n            Pipeline (WAGP), requires a careful balancing of interests\n            and responsibilities of different stakeholders. The risks,\n            responsibilities and incentives of all these stakeholders\n            need to be appropriately allocated for the success of the\n            project. The scope and conduct of supervision of a\n            transformational regional project should be comprehensive\n            regardless of the instrument used and amount of Bank\n            support. Economic and financial evaluations should assume a\n            wider range of commodity prices and other variables. Capital\n            intensive, cross-border energy infrastructure projects\n            should have stronger commercial underpinnings. The WAGP was\n            conceived as an Economic Community of West African States\n            initiative, with Nigeria playing a dominant role in\n            exporting natural gas to its smaller neighbors in the\n            region. The project, therefore, had strong regional\n            political support. However, while an elaborate contractual\n            framework was developed, the commercial provisions were\n            rarely enforced by the signing parties. At the time of\n            project sanction, WAGP prices were very attractive relative\n            to domestic process. The main lesson is that upstream gas\n            prices should be structured so that gas exports maintain\n            their competitiveness vis-a-vis competing domestic sales."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - The West African Gas Pipeline Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - The West African Gas\n            Pipeline

and offshore\n            pipeline that transports gas from Nigeria to Benin, Togo,\n            and Ghana, providing gas to power generating units. Under\n            WAGP, risk mitigation is provided through an International\n            Development Association (IDA) Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG)\n            of US$50 million, with respect to gas purchases of\n            Ghana's Volta River Authority (VRA), a Guarantee from\n            the Multilateral Investment and Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of\n            US$75 million, and commercial insurance to back the credit\n            risk of VRA. On April 27, 2006, the Inspection Panel\n            received a request for inspection on the project. The\n            request was submitted by the Ifesowapo Host Communities\n            Forum of the WAGP Project through their representatives from\n            Olorunda Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria.\n            Additionally, the Panel received a letter from Friends of\n            the Earth Ghana (FoE-Ghana), expressing their support for\n            the request and asking to be included among the requesters.\n            The Host Communities Forum and FoE-Ghana represented local\n            people living in Nigeria and Ghana, and were recognized as\n            the requesters. The requesters from Nigeria's Delta\n            Region were mainly concerned with the project's impact\n            on gas flaring reduction and with the safety of an existing\n            pipeline to which WAGP was to be linked. The requesters and\n            affected communities living near the gas pipeline in Nigeria\n            complained mainly about the low compensation rates received\n            for their land. Those living in southwestern Nigeria, where\n            the pipeline goes under the sea, claimed that the\n            construction process would hurt their fishing enterprise.\n            The requesters from Ghana were concerned about inadequate\n            consultation regarding the project's economic\n            viability, the pipeline's safety, and its impacts on\n            coastal fisheries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - West African Gas Pipeline\n            Project : fourth progress report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa Region - West African Gas\n            Pipeline Project : fourth progress report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/03/16216019/africa-region-west-african-gas-pipeline-project-fourth-progress-report","projn":"3A-West African Gas Pipeline (Ida S/Up) -- P082502","docty":"Investigation Report","subtopic":"Wetlands,Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Housing & Human Habitats,Energy Production and Transportation,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Water Resources,Energy,Industry,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120409043820"},"subsc":"Oil and gas","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Resources,Energy,Industry,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Guarantees","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to Information, Agriculture,\n            approach, associated gas, availability, balance, Barrier\n            Island, beach, civil works, coastal erosion, Communities,\n            Community Development, construction, contractual\n            arrangements, cost savings, crops, Data entry, Description,\n            domestic gas, Electricity, energy source, Environmental,\n            Environmental Management, environmental problems,\n            Environmental Protection, Environmental Protection Agency,\n            erosion, fish, fisheries, fishing, Forestry, fuel, fuel\n            supply, GAS, gas flaring, gas flaring reduction, gas\n            infrastructure, gas market, GAS PIPELINE, Gas Pipeline\n            Company, Gas Pipeline Project, gas purchase, gas purchases,\n            Gas Sales, Gas Supplies, gas supply, households,\n            intervention, interventions, land use, market prices,\n            Million Cubic Feet per Day, mitigation, mobile clinics, Oil,\n            Oil & Gas, ongoing basis, Petroleum, Petroleum\n            Corporation, Petroleum Resources, pipeline safety, Pipeline\n            System, power, power producers, power sector, Power Station,\n            producers, public awareness, refining, regional development,\n            Resettlement, restoration, Restoration Activities,\n            restoration programs, River, safety, sand, shore, shore\n            areas, sustainable operation, Traffic, utilities, waste\n            management, wetlands"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","repnb":"67923"},"10527568":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2009/01/10527568/ghana-west-african-gas-pipeline-wagp-project-progress-report-board-executive-directors-implementation-managements-action-plan-response-inspection-panel-investigation-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2009/01/10527568/ghana-west-african-gas-pipeline-wagp-project-progress-report-board-executive-directors-implementation-managements-action-plan-response-inspection-panel-investigation-report","new_url":"2009/01/10527568/ghana-west-african-gas-pipeline-wagp-project-progress-report-board-executive-directors-implementation-managements-action-plan-response-inspection-panel-investigation-report","disclosure_date":"2009-12-09T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/05/06/000333037_20090506044510/Rendered/INDEX/483970INVR0Gha101Official0Use0Only1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/05/06/000333037_20090506044510/Rendered/PDF/483970INVR0Gha101Official0Use0Only1.pdf","credit_no":"B006","datestored":"2009-05-06T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ghana - West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP)\n            Project : progress report to the Board of Executive\n            Directors on the Implementation of management's action\n            plan in response to the inspection panel investigation report"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"On April 25, 2008, the Inspection Panel\n            submitted its investigation report on the West African Gas\n            Pipeline (WAGP) Project for Ghana to the Board of Executive\n            Directors.

The Board approved the panel\n            recommendation on July 27, 2006, on a non-objection basis.\n            In its final report and recommendation, dated March 1, 2007,\n            the panel recommended an investigation to the Board of\n            Executive Directors, which was approved on March 13, 2007.\n            On April 25, 2008, the panel issued its report outlining the\n            findings of the investigation. Management appreciates the\n            panel's clear and thorough presentation of its\n            findings. This report responds to the findings of the panel.\n            The second section provides background and the status of the\n            Project; the third section summarizes the findings of the\n            panel; the fourth section addresses special issues emerging\n            from the panel's investigation report; the fifth\n            section includes management's action plan; and the\n            sixth section contains the conclusion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
