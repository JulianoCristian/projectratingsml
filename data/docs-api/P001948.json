becoming effective on October 12,\n            1979. The project closing date, initially scheduled for\n            March 31, 1985, was extended on four occasions, eventually\n            until September 30, 1989. The final disbursement of proceeds\n            was made on September 28, 1989, and the credit was disbursed\n            in its entirety. The general objectives of the project were\n            to increase pastoralists' incomes and improve the\n            economic environment for livestock production. In the\n            different types of zone, production systems were to be made\n            more productive: in the cropping zone, for instance, the\n            goal was to increase livestock productivity, while in the\n            pastoral zone pastoralists were to be organized more\n            effectively, particularly for pasture and water resource\n            management.
