Some lessons learned includes: outcome\n            indicators should not depend on future reports for which\n            funding are not assured. EGRGs were useful in maintaining an\n            agenda for reforms that had benefited from analytical and\n            operational work done ahead of time and for which technical\n            assistance and project support were available. Reforms that\n            had been identified and understood well ahead of time helped\n            secure support among development agencies. The EGRGs\n            experience highlighted the importance of complementary\n            technical assistance in a fragile state environment. Many of\n            the reforms aimed at supporting PFM and private sector\n            development were possible because, in parallel with the\n            budget support, the World Bank Group International Finance\n            Corporation (including IFC), provided technical assistance\n            crucially given the country's weak institutional\n            capacity to achieve results. The EGRGs were useful in\n            compensating for the unpredictability of annual aid flows\n            from more politically motivated sources of support. By\n            channeling resources through the budget, instead of through\n            projects, where Government decision-making and\n            implementation of the government structural reform agenda\n            are limited, the EGRGs instrument helped foster\n            decision-making within Government. The EGRG series benefited\n            from a mutually reinforcing partnership between the World\n            Bank and the IMF that combined efforts to attain\n            macroeconomic stability with needed structural reforms in\n            areas ranging from education and health to public financial\n            management and private sector development. The collaboration\n            between the two institutions helped craft an implementable\n            reform agenda that combined extensive technical assistance\n            and funding, supported by a continuity of involvement during\n            the most challenging times during this period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Second Economic Governance\n            Reform Grant

of the\n            Economic Governance Reform Grant Program (EGRG) for\n            Guinea-Bissau are to: (i) promote efficiency, transparency,\n            and accountability in the use of public resources through\n            improved public financial management (PFM); and (ii) foster\n            private sector development mainly through the development of\n            a modern legal framework for private investment and\n            improvements in the business environment. The series aims to\n            support the government's efforts to implement the\n            country's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).\n            Specifically, the one-tranche development policy grant (EGRG\n            I) in the amount of SDR 5.4 million (US$8 million\n            equivalent) focuses on reforms that will help promote\n            efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of\n            public resources, and foster private sector development by\n            reducing the up-front costs and uncertainties of business\n            creation and promoting a level playing field for private\n            investors. These two planks are critical components of PRSP\n            pillars one (good governance, macroeconomic stability, and\n            public administration reform); and two (private sector-led\n            growth). The grant is thus an integral part of International\n            Development Association (IDA) Interim Strategy Note (ISN)\n            for Guinea-Bissau for FY09-10 planned to be presented to the\n
