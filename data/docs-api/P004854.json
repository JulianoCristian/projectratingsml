The\n            project consisted of a group of high-priority subprojects in\n            the agriculture, industry and infrastructure sectors. These\n            subprojects complemented each other, and/or supported\n            specific production activities, with a view to strengthening\n            and diversifying of the economic base, enhancing generation\n            of new economic activities, and creating new employment\n            opportunities. The subprojects were accorded a high priority\n            by the Government in its fifth development plan (1985-87)\n            and were supported by ADB  and UNDP, they were of a\n            complementary nature and supported productive activities,\n            and they had estimated acceptable economic rates of returns,\n            especially in the cases of the agricultural and road\n            development subprojects. Although these subprojects had been\n            evaluated to determine their suitability for ADB/IDA\n            financing, detailed economic analysis of the individual\n            subprojects was to be undertaken by the Govemment, with the\n            assistance of consultants, and were only toproceed if\n            approved by ADB/IDA and if they met a cutoff point of a 12\n            percent economic rate of return, and/or recovered costs.\n            Subprojects could be added to or substituted forthe four\n            tentative subprojects which were: (i) tree crop development;\n            (ii) rural roadupgrading; (iii) construction of a small\n            industries center; and (iv) upgrading of Apiaharbor's\n            container park. A key lesson is that the experience of this\n            particular projectcarnnot be taken, on its own, as\n            demonstrating the Multiproject approach as a costeffective\n            method of delivering assistance to small countries. The tree\n            crop andpower subprojects required different supervision\n            skills, which were forthcoming, but at acost. This\n            particular project appears to have struck a reasonable\n            balance between meetingthe available small investment\n            opportunities - which may range across sectors - and\n            costeffectivenessof supervision. The experience of the\n            project should be taken as indicatingthat great caution is\n            needed towards the Multiproject approach, and the need for\n            aconcerted effort during preparation to consider component\n            design and a detailed, costed,supervision plan. It\n            reconfirms the importance of making an upfront judgrnent as\n            towhether the quantity, quality, and skills mix of\n            supervision resources which canrealistically be budgeted, is\n            in line with the needs for successful implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Western Samoa -
