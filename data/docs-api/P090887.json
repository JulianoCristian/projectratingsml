Some\n            lessons learned includes: the value of long-term involvement\n            (by the World Bank) in the development of a sustainable\n            advisory system is evident; the use of a range of\n            mechanisms, including farmer training courses, field\n            demonstrations, working through special interest groups, and\n            information campaigns was effective. Clear and transparent\n            procedures and criteria are an essential element. The impact\n            was most likely greater due to innovative ideas coming from\n            different fields rather than through selection of specific\n            value chains. Important lessons here are the need to more\n            effectively build on previous efforts, and to conduct an\n            information campaign in advertising and promotion of the\n            system to increase customer base that will eventually make\n            the system more sustainable. Another lesson is the value of\n            rapid reaction to evolving needs, and inclusion of new\n            activities within the scope of the project objectives. The\n            government should use the concept of public-private\n            partnerships and promote such partnerships in other areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Second Agricultural
