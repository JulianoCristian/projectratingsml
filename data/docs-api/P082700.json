The lessons\n            learned indicate that it is generally agreed that volatility\n            (and periodic intra-year cuts) in funding for social\n            protection programs should be avoided since it leads to\n            inefficiency and ultimately substantial costs in terms of\n            lost human capital development in the medium term. The use\n            of well-defined indicators associated with the expected\n            results helps not only the implementation of the credit, but\n            the targeting of actions by the Government. The Social\n            Safety Net Structural Adjusment Credit (SSNSAC) focused\n            attention on a few well-selected programs that were closely\n            aligned to the overall goal of the program-social protection\n            in a time of fiscal constraints. A structural adjustment\n            operation that involves a process of relatively complex\n            change, such as the establishment of an effective social\n            safety net, will be difficult to implement on an operational\n            level. To improve the results of education and health\n            services and of social protection programs and expand access\n            to the most vulnerable populations (often indigenous\n            peoples), awareness and training activities should be\n            expanded through dialogue and focus groups mechanisms\n            promoting the reduction of cultural impediments to accessing\n            services. Technical assistance should be provided for the\n            development of information systems, within the Information\n            and Administrative Modernization System (SIGMA), so that\n            better decisions can be adopted on the use of public\n            resources and their follow-up at all levels of Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -

Those\n            reforms, sustained and deepened in successive Governments up\n            to the present, met with early success in stimulating\n            growth, but the economy's performance stalled after\n            1998, due to several causes, and poverty increased over the\n            last 5 years. This eroded popular support for the reforms,\n            and recently led to a serious episode of civil unrest. The\n            Social Safety Net Structural Adjustment Credit, a\n            two-tranche credit intended to be completed by March 2004,\n            is a part of IDA'S immediate response package to the\n            current social and economic crisis in Bolivia. The credit\n            supports the Government's near term program of fiscal\n            adjustment and provision of vital social safety net\n            services. The credit thus will help the Government to close\n            a financing gap in 2003, expand the provision of social\n            services during this period of fiscal adjustment, contain\n            erosion in social outcomes for the poor ,to address the\n            economic underpinnings of rising social tensions.\n            Specifically, the program would: (i) protect the budgets of\n            nine key programs (National Emergency Employment Program,\n            Health Reform, Epidemiological Shield for Chagas, Malaria,\n            and Tuberculosis, Universal Health Insurance for Mother and\n            Child Care, Expanded Immunization Program, Education Reform\n            and Education Quality), that are subject to high volatility\n            in investment budgets and expenditure execution and are key\n            to the containment of further erosion of social outcomes and\n            achievement of counter-cyclical goals of the 2003\n            budget;(ii) sustain and, in some areas, strengthen key\n            social sector reforms of this Government and it s\n            predecessors; (iii)provide technical support over the\n            bridging period (June2003 to March 2004) to protected social\n            safety net programs. The time horizon is a bridging period\n            of 9-10 months, during which stability, both social and\n            fiscal, can be restored, and the foundations for medium term\n            reform
