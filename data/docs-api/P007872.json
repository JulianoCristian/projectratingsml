crops, mainly soybeans and cotton, produced under a mixed\n            crop/livestock farming operation carried out by small-scale\n            farmers. A possible risk is an unexpected deterioration of\n            beef prices that could deter ranchers from seeking credit at\n            the levels assumed under the project. In the case of the\n            small-scale farmers, the project's expected benefits\n            will depend on FG's (Livestock Fund of Central Bank)\n            ability to provide the technical assistance required for the\n            intensive farming system considered under the project,\n            thereby substantially increasing lending for small farmers\n            as envisioned under the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Proyecto de Desarrollo Ganadero"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panam\u00e1: Proyecto de Desarrollo\n            Ganadero : Paraguay - Proyecto de Desarrollo Ganadero"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/04/11969246/paraguay-livestock-development-project-paraguay-proyecto-de-desarrollo-ganadero","projn":"PY-Livestock Devt -- P007872","subtopic":"Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Paraguay","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100319013111"},"subsc":"(Historic)Livestock","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural credit; Animal production;\n            Beef; Cattle; Cotton; Dairies; Financial assistance;\n            Livestock industry; Plant production; Poultry; Soybeans;\n            Swine; Technical assistance,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural credit; Animal production;\n            Beef; Cattle; Cotton; Dairies; Financial assistance;\n            Livestock industry; Plant production; Poultry; Soybeans;\n            Swine; Technical assistance,,"}},"owner":"WB Off:Lima-Andean Countries CMU (LCC6C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"3311","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Proyecto de Desarrollo Ganadero"}}},"facets":{}}}
