Three main lessons were\n            drawn from the project: 1) There is a need to adopt a more\n            cautious approach to traffic forecasting, particularly on\n            toll roads in provinces in China's hinterland, as\n            demonstrated by two seemingly contradictory events that\n            occurred under the project: Early on, the project was\n            modified to allow for the upgrading from 2 lanes to 4 lanes\n            of some sections of Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan Highway;\n            however later on, it was found that the actual traffic was\n            far below expectations, not only the new road but also in\n            the whole corridor. 2) Traffic accidents rates in China\n            continue to raise serious concerns. One should not\n            underestimate the risks, nor should one have too high\n            expectations within one single project. 3) The efficiency of\n            technical assistance (TA) in Highway Projects has sometimes\n            been questioned in terms of high costs and limited\n            effectiveness as perceived by some provinces. The TA\n            provided for the studies under this project has been\n            considered successful by all parties involved in terms of\n            outcome, and the ingredients for success appear to be firm\n            grounding in a sectoral strategy, supporter from MOC as well\n            as the concerned provinces, good selection of local and\n            international teams, and appropriate arrangements for the\n            conduct of the studies and their dissemination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Xinjiang Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
