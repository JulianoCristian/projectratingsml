The\n            operation has promoted the implementation of important\n            reforms in the health sector aimed at ensuring an efficient\n            and responsive delivery of public services within fiscally\n            sound policies. However, Tucuman's performance was\n            hampered by the lack of political support from the\n            provincial legislature and the lack of solid leadership in\n            the education sector. On the other hand, Tucuman's\n            highly successful experience with some individual\n            components, such as self-managed hospitals, can have a\n            strong demonstration effect for other provinces. The lessons\n            of experience from this project include: a)\n            Quick-disbursement loans directed to sub-national\n            governments can be effective complements of sector reforms\n            and operations. b) A determined executive branch supporting\n            sector champions with vision can successfully pursue a\n            reform effort under less than optimal political and social\n            conditions. c) Sector reforms are possible even when the\n            overriding priority is fiscal adjustment. d) The combination\n            of effective sector leadership and participatory mechanisms\n            in the design and implementation of reforms can be a\n            powerful tool for pursuing institutional change and\n            overcoming bureaucratic resistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Second Provincial Reform Project\n            : Tucuman"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Second Provincial\n            Reform

Projects will help the Tucuman, Rio Negro, Salta and\n            San Juan provinces to reform and restructure their\n            governments to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery\n            of public services (notably social services) within fiscally\n            sound policies. The loan will be disbursed depending on\n            successful implementation of the following reforms and\n            performance benchmarks: 1) public performance reviews will\n            assess: whether overall fiscal and debt targets were\n            reached, the composition of social sector expenditures, the\n            rationale for new borrowing to refinance old debt and/or to\n            finance priority investment programs, and the economic\n            justification for all large projects; 2) public finance\n            reforms include reestablishing provincial fiscal balance by\n            improving tax collection, reducing current government\n            expenditures - namely civil service reductions, and\n            shrinking provincial debt; 3) selected education reforms\n            include consolidating classes, controlling absenteeism,\n            reducing overhead costs, reconverting public teacher\n            training institutions, and introducing new subsidy systems\n            for private schools; benchmarks include reducing\n            non-essential personnel, improving student-teacher ratios,\n            and shifting personnel expenditures towards investment and\n            other outlays; and 4) selected health reforms include\n            separating provision and financing of public health services\n            by giving hospitals autonomy, implementing new management\n            and payment systems, improving insurance coverage by\n            identifying poor beneficiaries, defining the health package,\n            and legally implementing the new insurance system prior to\n            the last tranche release."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Four Second Provincial Reform\n            Adjustment Loan Projects - Rio
