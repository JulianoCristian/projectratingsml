Some lessons learned included: both the\n            rural piped water and the pourashava components experienced\n            problems because certain pre-requisites were not in place.\n            In the case of the rural piped schemes, the BWSPP component\n            for a credit facility really should have been in place\n            before the private sponsors began construction. As this was\n            not the case, the component had trouble attracting and\n            retaining private sponsors because they could not obtain\n            loans for financing and capital investment. The pourashava\n            component, as originally designed, required changes in\n            legislation and buy-in from the municipalities before the\n            private operators could effectively begin to work. Better\n            sequencing of various activities could have avoided at least\n            some of the implementation problems. The procurement burden,\n            especially of innovative projects using local private\n            operators for water supplies, needs to be well-evaluated\n            during project preparation. Attempting to introduce a\n            private operator approach in both rural piped and pourashava\n            schemes was extremely demanding. The non-piped water\n            component was successfully implemented, despite the many\n            problems faced by BWSPP, in part because the approach had\n            been developed and tested in the course of Bangladesh\n            Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Water Supply Program

Program Project is to contribute to Bangladesh's\n            efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in water\n            supply and sanitation by 2015. Bangladesh is well endowed\n            with groundwater resources. More than 90 percent of the\n            rural population has access to water supply mainly through\n            tapping these groundwater resources. Fifty percent of the\n            urban population has access to piped water. However, since\n            the early 1990's, many of the aquifers were found to be\n            contaminated with arsenic at levels not just above the World\n            Health Organization guideline level of 10 ppb but above\n            Bangladesh's national standard of 50 ppb as well.\n            Building on a previous project aimed at addressing the\n            arsenic contamination issue (Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation\n            Water Supply Project), the Bangladesh Water Supply Program\n            Project (BWSPP) was designed to shift rural households from\n            arsenic contaminated tube wells towards safe water sources\n            while simultaneously improving on the quality of service\n            provision through small scale piped water schemes in rural\n            villages. It was intended to improve service delivery,\n            strengthen ownership by end users, introduce cost recovery,\n            and ensure the financial viability of the water supply\n            schemes. The BWSPP endeavored to pilot institutional reforms\n            to ensure the sustainability of continued safe water supply.\n            The project restructuring will focus on the following\n            principles: (a) maintaining the overall project objective\n            towards supporting the increase of access to safe water; (b)\n            incorporating the reallocation and revisions occasioned by\n            the Bank response to the 2007 floods and cyclone; (c)\n            narrowing down the range of project activities by focusing\n            on a manageable range of innovative/pilot measures and\n            completing a reasonable target of schemes to achieve an\n            outcome consistent with the pilot nature of many project\n            activities; and (d) carrying out activities that have\n            already commenced up to the demonstration of actual increase\n            of safe water provision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -

- Water Supply Program Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Bangladesh Water Supply Program\n            Projects is a pilot initiative, whose overall focus is based\n            on three guiding principles that will 1) assist the\n            Government in moving forward towards achieving the\n            Millennium Development Goals for water supply and sanitation\n            by 2015; 2) scale up measures to provide arsenic free, and\n            bacteriological safe water in rural areas, and small towns;\n            and, 3) support the decentralization process initiated by\n            the Government as part of the water sector reform process.\n            This environmental assessment (EA) provides an insight into\n            the  challenges in  dealing with water quality problems, and\n            those related to management of surface and ground water. The\n            EA outlines several types of risks: capacity building risks\n            of different institutions likely to be involved in the\n            project, enforcement and contractual risks for private\n            sector participation, tariff rationalization risks, policy\n            reform risks, environmental risks and risk of coordination\n            among the different stakeholders for a better operational\n            strategy. It suggests  mitigation strategies, and a\n            monitoring plan as follows. The monitoring plan includes an\n            environmental checklist for both rural and urban areas that\n            can be used as a tool to assess the status of adverse\n            impacts during project implementation. Adverse environmental\n            impacts include shallow and deep aquifers, treated dug/ring\n            wells, piped water supply schemes from treated surface water\n            sources, rainwater harvesting, pond-sand filter, arsenic\n            removal units attached to the contaminated tubewells, and\n            domestic filter at the household level. Other possible\n            impacts on natural habitat, and other pollution include\n            traffic congestion, noise pollution and drainage problems.\n            The environmental management strategy gives special emphasis\n            on arsenic contamination: its health implications, arsenic\n            removal technologies, water quality surveillance, and\n            arsenic sludge disposal options, and, further indicates the\n            relevant environmental legislations that can be used during\n            implementation. It also provides a rapid environmental\n            assessment checklist that can be used for both rural and\n            urban water supply projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Water Supply
