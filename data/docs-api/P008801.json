Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: securing budgets for conservation at the\n            regional level as soon as possible. As with many\n            conservation projects supported by the Bank/global\n            environment facility (GEF), a commitment by the government\n            to allocating resources for the longer term needs to be\n            secured and arrangements for a stable funding mechanism\n            stipulated and agreed during project preparation. While the\n            budget for environment conservation of the model regions has\n            seen increases, overall allocations for conservation have\n            been reduced. Using a programmatic approach for complex and\n            challenging conservation projects. A programmatic approach\n            or another phasing instrument may be more appropriate in\n            obtaining tractability in the short-term and sustainability\n            in the long-term. This will have been especially appropriate\n            given the 60 major tasks and numerous sub-tasks spread\n            across Russia, involving national, regional and local\n            governments and staff from Non-governmental Organizations\n            (NGOs), academia and the general public. Integrating\n            conservation with regional/local planning commensurate with\n            projected needs to conserve biodiversity at ecosystem,\n            species and genetic levels. For future projects, priority\n            should be given to better integration of protected areas\n            (PAs) with the growth of local economies based upon enhanced\n            ecosystem services and to adapting emerging tools to support\n            restoration of ecological units, especially for application\n            in the most heavily degraded agrarian regions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia - Biodiversity Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russia - Biodiversity\n            Conservation

Lessons on\n            sector development issues indicate that through the\n            development of Regional Conservation Strategies and Action\n            Plans, regional coordinating centers, small grants programs,\n            and others,  proved instrumental in addressing conservation\n            issues at the regional scope. Although there is high quality\n            technical expertise in Russia to support implementation\n            ofnational and regional conservation programs,  the local\n            institutional \"infrastructure\" for providing\n            respective consulting and advisory services however,  is\n            underdeveloped.
