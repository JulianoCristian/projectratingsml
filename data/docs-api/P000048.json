The project was complex\n            for a first investment in health sector in a country with\n            little Bank experience and low capacity. Project\n            implementation was affected by the hostilities and has been\n            difficult even in government-controlled areas. The key\n            lessons learned from this project include: 1) When a client\n            is new and unfamiliar with Bank procedures, it is advisable\n            for the Bank to devote additional resources to supervision\n            and technical assistance to acquaint the government more\n            fully with these procedures. 2) The project was approved\n            following the resumption of hostilities in Angola. Given the\n            high uncertainty at that time, it would have been prudent to\n            formulate an exit strategy. 3) Highly motivated teams can\n            make a difference, even when overall conditions are inimical\n            to development. The satisfactory implementation of the\n            essential medicine program is an illustration of what can be\n            achieved in spite of a difficult environment. 4) Technical\n            assistance is a waste of resources when there is little\n            government commitment to sound sector management and\n            institution building. 5) In view of the importance of\n            continued government commitment to a project for its\n            successful implementation and outcome, criteria to assess\n            such commitment should be established early on and\n            continuously monitored during supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola -

The project\n            consists of two components. The first component,\n            strengthening health sector policy and management will be\n            achieved through: (i) a comprehensive technical assistance\n            program in planning and management; (ii) short term training\n            for senior staff; and (iii) provision of consultancies for\n            investment studies. The second component, selected\n            rehabilitation program, will be achieved through: (i)\n            support for priority national health programs and family\n            planning; (ii) rehabilitation of selected health posts in\n            the province of Huila; (iii) relocation and upgrading of the\n            health professional school, the health center and two health\n            posts and minor rehabilitation and essential equipment for\n            the pediatric center and the municipal health center in\n            Lubango;
