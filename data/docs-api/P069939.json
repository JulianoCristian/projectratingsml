Some lessons learned included: the\n            Bank's role in promoting public administration reform\n            in accession countries is delicate and essential but\n            requires very strong coordination with other development\n            donors, especially the EU; maintaining a narrow focus on the\n            development objectives and the project design ensures\n            improved supervision and allows better utilization of\n            supervision resources; a divided polity requires ensuring\n            commitment and ownership for reforms that goes beyond the\n            Government; complementarities with adjustment operations has\n            positive effects which should continue to be pursued; and\n            difficult automation projects, such as the

entry of\n            the Public Administration Reform Project in Albania to be\n            highly satisfactory overall. The key problems encounters\n            were: i) shift in government commitment, when a change in\n            Prime Minister led to dilution of the earlier civil service\n            law/regulations, and the protections that were built in for\n            merit; ii) slow implementation progress with consequent\n            delays in disbursements; iii) frequent changes in government\n            Ministers making continuity of reform difficult. In the\n            process it made sound use of field office staff to interact\n            with the borrower on a continuous basis and to sustain the\n            agencies' attention on implementation issues, again\n            using the leverage of the poverty reduction support credit\n            (PRSC) and related projects as needed. Finally, the team\n            worked well with other key donors such as department for\n            international development (DFID) to ensure that\n            complementary activities were adequately funded, when they\n            ran short of resources. Linking technical assistance (TA)\n            loans to policy based operations is an effective way of\n            ensuring that less glamorous activities of the TA get needed\n            attention and are properly implemented. Also, good\n            implementation requires that Bank staff work outside their\n            own \"sectoral silos\", as in Albania."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Public Administration Reform\n

The project has four components. The\n            public expenditure component addresses five elements of the\n            public expenditure system, plus strengthening of the\n            management of the Ministry of Finance itself: budget\n            formulation; budget execution (treasury); macroeconomic and\n            fiscal forecasting and analysis; accounting; procurement;\n            and management of the MOF. The second component, the\n            strengthening of human resource management, includes three\n            sub-components: implementation of the recently enacted Civil\n            Service Act; strengthening of the Department of Public\n            Administration; and support of the establishment of an\n            Albanian Institute of Public Administration. The third\n            component, policy coordination, strengthens the capacity of\n            civil service professionals to provide the council of\n            ministers with policy analysis and support its coordination\n            function. The last component ensures project management and\n            implementation, including supporting all the required\n            project administration capacities (accounting, audit,\n            procurement, disbursement management, monitoring and\n            evaluation) and supports several specific initiatives for\n            monitoring and publicizing the intermediate impacts of the\n
