Starting from 1993, the World Bank\n            provided 6 loans totaling United States (U.S.) 1083.4\n            million dollars for the development of Ukraine's main\n            state institutions. 1993-1999, the institutional loan\n            project was implemented (the total cost of the project was\n            U.S. 44 million dollars; the World Bank loan is 27 million).\n            In 1994-1996, the rehabilitation loan project was\n            implemented (U.S. 500 million dollars). Within the framework\n            of these projects, consultancy and advisory services were,\n            in particular, rendered, equipment was purchased for the\n            Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and other government\n            institutions, the National Bank of Ukraine, and the state\n            property fund; foreign currency was also provided for\n            purchasing critical-import goods; the budget received\n            support for strengthening the system of social protection of\n            the poorest strata of the population. This loan is aimed at\n            resolving some problem issues of Ukrainian reforms and,\n            specifically in the area of fiscal and financial discipline,\n            regulatory policy, forming and protecting of ownership\n            rights, and achieving of social stability. For project\n            implementation, a series of programmatic adjustment loans\n            are to be provided, aimed at achieving the efficiency of the\n            government performance. The project supports the Ukrainian\n            government's efforts to build up the functional and\n            computerized treasury system which is expected to increase\n            the efficiency of the budget execution and ensure its\n            implementation in full scope and more controllable cash\n            flow. The project supports the state tax\n            administration's efforts to develop and introduce a\n            single system of state registration of tax payers at\n            Ukraine's tax bodies, and a system of supervising the\n            calculation and receipt of payments, as well as\n            reorganization of the tax service by the functional principle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects related to public sector reform"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects related to\n            public sector reform"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955129/world-bank-projects-related-public-sector-reform","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adjustment, Adjustment Loan, Adjustment\n            Loans, Bank loan, cash flow, corruption, deposit, deposit\n            accounts, economic development, Economic Reforms, equipment,\n            financial discipline, foreign currency, funds management,\n            Institutional Loan, institutional reforms, international\n            standards, National Bank, ownership rights, Rehabilitation\n            Loan, reorganization, salaries, social protection, Tax, Tax\n            Administration, tax base, tax burden, tax legislation, tax\n            system, taxation, technical assistance, treasury, wages,\n            World Bank loan"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Rehabilitation Loan"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Economic management,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Public Sector Downsizing m1327494 2085,Public Finance m1326315 713,Public Administration m1327723 723,Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Public Service Delivery m1326771 728","projn":"UA-Rehabilitation -- P009108,UA-Institution Building -- P009106","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Economic Adjustment and Lending,Taxation & Subsidies,Emerging Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Private Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204144051"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Banking,Power,General industry and trade sector,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Sub-national government administration,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems,Central government administration","theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Macroeconomic management,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Regulation and competition policy,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Debt management and fiscal sustainability,Other economic management,Tax policy and administration","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Public Sector Downsizing m1327494 2085,Public Finance m1326315 713,Public Administration m1327723 723,Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Public Service Delivery m1326771 728","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","U"],"trustfund":"TF023660-DUTCH CTF FOR EASTERN EUROPE,TF027980-SWISS CONSULTANT TRUST FUND FOR\n            EASTERN EUROPE AND THE CIS,TF020232-REHABILITATION LOAN,TFM20232-REHABILITATION LOAN,TFS20232-REHABILITATION LOAN","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"92195"},"728338":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/06/728338/ukraine-institution-building-loan-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1999/06/728338/ukraine-institution-building-loan-project","new_url":"1999/06/728338/ukraine-institution-building-loan-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/28/000094946_99072307291245/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/07/28/000094946_99072307291245/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"3614;P211","datestored":"1999-07-28T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1999-06-03T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Ukraine -

Key lessons learned\n            included: This project helped to establish a broad\n            constituency for economic reform, built up significant\n            implementation capacity within the Government, and\n            demonstrated the importance of institution building using a\n            flexible approach. Government \"ownership\" of the\n            project is an important factor: when the Government adopted\n            a comprehensive structural reform program and restructured\n            the project, its commitment was enhanced. Limited and\n            focused programs, particularly pilots, are effective tools\n            for launching reforms in politically sensitive areas.\n            Intensive supervision by experienced Bank staff is a key\n            factor for institution building in new member countries.\n            There was flexibility in project design and redesign during\n            implementation. Procurement was delayed because of the long\n            learning curve in comprehending and internalizing\n            transparent and open bidding procedures. There is\n            deep-seated cultural and political bias against foreign\n            consultants which often leads to contractual disputes and a\n            slowing down of project implementation. Using a centralized\n            project implementation unit at the ministry of economy\n            slowed down implementation due to poor communication between\n            the PIU and the
