The project will also provide US$90 million to GOI\n            to help finance the import of polymers needed to develop the\n            market in India prior to plant commissioning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Maharashtra Petrochemical Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Maharashtra Petrochemical Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1985/02/740131/india-maharashtra-petrochemical-project","projn":"IN-Maharashtra Petroche -- P009836","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Achieving Shared Growth","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970702135733"},"subsc":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absolute terms,adjustment\n            process,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,agricultural sector,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,capital formation,capital\n            goods,capital inflows,capital markets,capital\n            requirements,coal,commercial banks,commercial\n            borrowing,commercial loans,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,Country\n            data,creditworthiness,Debt,debt service,deficits,developed\n            countries,developing countries,developing\n            regions,development efforts,development projects,development\n            strategy,domestic savings,economic efficiency,economic\n            growth,economic policies,economics,Electricity,Electricity\n            generation,employment,equilibrium,equilibrium\n            prices,exchange rate,expenditures,export\n            promotion,exports,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,foreign\n            exchange reserves,GDP,gross national savings,growth\n            rate,growth rates,health services,human development,import\n            liberalization,imports,income,income growth,income\n            levels,Industrial Development,industrial\n            sector,industrialization,inflation,interest\n            rate,intermediate goods,Internal Cash Generation,investment\n            rate,labor force,living standards,long-term growth,"},"1":{"cdata!":"absolute terms,adjustment\n            process,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,agricultural sector,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,capital formation,capital\n            goods,capital inflows,capital markets,capital\n            requirements,coal,commercial banks,commercial\n            borrowing,commercial loans,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,Country\n            data,creditworthiness,Debt,debt service,deficits,developed\n            countries,developing countries,developing\n            regions,development efforts,development projects,development\n            strategy,domestic savings,economic efficiency,economic\n            growth,economic policies,economics,Electricity,Electricity\n            generation,employment,equilibrium,equilibrium\n            prices,exchange rate,expenditures,export\n            promotion,exports,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,foreign\n            exchange reserves,GDP,gross national savings,growth\n            rate,growth rates,health services,human development,import\n            liberalization,imports,income,income growth,income\n            levels,Industrial Development,industrial\n            sector,industrialization,inflation,interest\n            rate,intermediate goods,Internal Cash Generation,investment\n            rate,labor force,living standards,long-term growth,"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"P3959"},"facets":{}}}
