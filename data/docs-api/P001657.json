Lessons\n            address once again the importance of a flexible approach to\n            implementation, particularly where capacity is weak, and\n            project design is overly complex. Both the Bank, and\n            Government recognized these flaws, and effectively\n            reallocated resources, and designed relevant activities\n            (such as the Fellowship Fund), an innovation to problems of\n            institutional change, conducive to a second generation\n            Training Fund, now under preparation. However, the\n            project's attempt to address multiple aspects of public\n            sector reform, without gaining grounds in any one area,\n            e.g., public expenditure management or civil service reform,\n            threatened the limited absorptive capacity of the\n            Government, whereas a more selective approach, focused on\n            tangible gains in specific reform areas would have been\n            preferable. Therefore, when implementing complex public\n            sector reforms, reforming governments should not only commit\n            to the process, but sequence initiatives so as to provide a\n            technical foundation for successive reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Second Institutional Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malawi - Second Institutional\n
