This minimizes the amount of\n            counterpart funding requirements and unforeseen fiscal\n            adjustments required by the federal and local government.\n            Community Participation: the participation of beneficiaries\n            and affected parties  in planning, designing, implementing\n            and managing the project is essential to ensure a\n            satisfactory outcome of an emergency project. 7) This\n            project benefited from several supervision missions that\n            included field visits and on-site inspections. Emergency\n            loans need to be designed with a flexible implementation framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - El Nino Emergency Flood Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina -

The project\n            has been designed with two geographical components: one for\n            the six northwestern provinces and the three Cuyo provinces,\n            and another for the seven participating littoral provinces.\n            A third component is designed to strengthen the\n            administrative and technical capacity to coordinate the\n            implementation of the project.  The operation will be\n            implemented in two phases: 1) a protection phase of 12\n            months for the northwestern provinces, which includes\n            acquiring of goods and execution of works for emergency\n            river flood control; and b) a rehabilitation phase for both\n            geographic regions, which includes transport infrastructure,\n            drainage systems, education and health facilities.  In\n            addition, there is a capacity-building subcomponent for the\n            northwestern provinces to manage flood emergencies and a\n            small scale housing subcomponent for
