The\n            dilemma of supporting a country in crisis is highlighted by\n            Policy Reform Support Loan - PRSL I and, more especially, by\n            PRSL II. The Bank needs to provide the Board with a frank\n            rationale for its intervention. The experience in Indonesia\n            highlights the importance of avoiding delays in banking\n            crisis: unless resolved quickly and decisively, the fiscal\n            costs mount and vested interests further impede resolution.\n            In a major crisis, Bank management and top technical\n            specialists should give priority to resolving issues that\n            arise in the context of Bank assistance addressing the\n            crisis, even if the vehicle for the assistance is in the\n            form of a relatively modest technical assistance loan.\n            Coordination among donor agencies is essential in countries\n            in crisis and needs to be made explicit. In Indonesia,\n            coordination was successful only after an initial period of\n            uncertainty, mainly because the IMF was able to take the\n            lead. The Bank's' consultant fee structure and\n            procurement rules caused delays and impeded a rapid response\n            to Indonesia's banking crisis, and excluded or\n            discouraged the few service providers with appropriate\n            technical expertise. The Bank's central unit Special\n            Financial Operations (SFO) enabled the Bank to respond to\n            Indonesia's need for technical expertise, but the unit\n            was not well integrated into the Bank's organization\n            and was unfamiliar with its operational procedures, causing\n            bureaucratic and practical problems. The Bank's\n            performance for PRSL I is rated as satisfactory, while under\n            Banking Reform Assistance Project (BRAP,) and PRSL 11 is\n            rated unsatisfactory, in part because quality at entry for\n            these two loans was not good. The Bank lacked a strategy for\n            dealing with the crisis and timely support from senior Bank\n            management was inadequate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First and Second Policy

The World Bank adapted the various\n            project components to accommodate the frequent changes and\n            urgent needs that could not be financed through the\n            government's budget due to unavailability of funds. It\n            was under extraordinary circumstances--the mounting crisis,\n            riots on the streets, the deep political and policy changes,\n            the lack of budgetary resources for urgent technical\n            assistance, and the coordination challenges within and among\n            international financial institutions--that the objectives\n            and components of the project were designed and implemented;\n            and under which their outcome should be assessed. In this\n            context, the project outcome was unsatisfactory and the\n            project unsustainable. Although both Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated as unsatisfactory, this simply\n            stated conclusion belies the extraordinary efforts\n            undertaken by both parties who were overwhelmed by a severe\n            financial crisis and a rapidly deteriorating political\n            situation. Lessons learned were several, including: For\n            crisis response lending, flexible design and rapid or timely\n            delivery are critical. Although a team specializing in\n            financial crisis management (the SFO team) was created to\n            deal with the East Asian crisis, this type of operation has\n            proven to be unsustainable within the Bank's\n            organizational structure and procedure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Banking Reform Assistance

It\n            is one element in a larger package of external financial\n            assistance to help the government implement a comprehensive\n            policy package comprising three parts: a strong\n            macroeconomic framework, a strategy to reform the financial\n            sector with special emphasis on the banking system; and a\n            broad range of structural measures to sharpen\n            competitiveness and improve guidance. Staffs of the World\n            Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Asian\n            Development Bank are jointly assisting the government in\n            implementing the program by emphasizing different\n            components. The WB project components consist of 1)\n            technical assistance by foreign experts for portfolio,\n            financial, and system audits, particularly the evaluation of\n            rehabilitation plans for private banks; 2) the restructuring\n            of state banks with the resolution of bad debts of merged\n            banks; 3) strengthening the examination, supervision, and\n            regulatory functions of Bank Indonesia; and 4) a diagnostic\n            review of the legal and institutional infrastructure for\n            financial sector development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Banking Reform Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Banking Reform\n            Assistance
