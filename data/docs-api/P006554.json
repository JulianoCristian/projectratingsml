The\n            lessons learned indicate that investment fund financing is\n            not the best approach to build a health network since\n            investment decisions are individual, not network related.\n            The structure for investment decision making needs to be\n            transparent and guided by technical principles, even if\n            priorities are set politically. Decentralization always\n            brings delays in implementation due to the weak capacity of\n            newly-decentralized entities. A project with decentralized\n            execution needs to provide sufficient support to\n            decentralized entities in procurement processes or the\n            project will experience severe delays. The formulation of\n            policy reform studies has to be set in a clear framework,\n            with a strategic focus and specified steps. The location of\n            the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) outside of the Ministry\n            of Health structure can limit the relevance of project\n            implementation activities and its impact. Monitoring and\n            evaluation arrangements must be specified during preparation\n            so that baseline information can be collected at project\n            start-up. The decision to have a national-level project and\n            secure parallel loans from the IBRD and IADB led to\n            excessive management complexity and less than efficient implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
