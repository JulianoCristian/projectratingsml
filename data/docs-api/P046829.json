Lessons include:\n            for interventions in rural Photovoltaic (PV) markets, it is\n            important to conduct a rigorous and extensive market study\n            early in the preparation stage to provide information on\n            market characteristics and barriers and to lay a solid\n            foundation for effective project design. Linking subsidies\n            to quality improvements can be effective in situations where\n            consumer perception of and feedback on quality are limited.\n            A technology-neutral and bottom-up approach that avoids\n            prescribing designs and sizes can be critical in unleashing\n            the creativity of businesses in developing products that\n            meet local needs.

A market-based approach to PV\n            dissemination requires a consistent and well coordinated\n            approach by all PV project supporters.

Lessons include: Energy Performance\n            Contract's (EPCs) require quick implementation and\n            closure, so it is important for the Bank's procurement\n            procedures to be flexible to provide the quick response\n            necessary to get the private sector involved in the Energy\n            Management Company (EMC) business. For an energy efficiency\n            project to succeed, it is important to engage government\n            officials across ministries in practical and operationally\n            focused dialogues to address specific implementation\n            challenges, such as regulatory instruments, financial\n            incentives, and provision of information. Although EPCs are\n            meant to be a market solution for energy efficiency, in a\n            transitional economy like China, strong government support\n            is crucial for the market to deliver successful results. In\n            the case of the Energy Conservation project, the\n            Government's policies, regulations and instructions on\n            reducing energy intensity were important drivers for the\n            expansion of the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB)\n            business. Strong country ownership requires adapting the\n            project to the country-specific context. Bank-generated\n            ideas work best when they are appropriately adapted to\n            country circumstances. In the case of the Energy\n            Conservation Project, the Government had adjusted tax\n            treatment and legal interpretation of EMCs, thereby creating\n            an enabling environment for the dissemination of the EPC\n            concept in China."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
