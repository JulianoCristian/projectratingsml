The project partially achieved its physical\n            objectives but achieved little of its institutional\n            development and private sector development objectives. The\n            loan was canceled early and there were project\n            implementation delays. Also, insufficient project resources\n            were applied to institutional development. The Bank's\n            performance is rated as deficient on the basis of inadequate\n            ownership, preparation time, project appraisal, and\n            engagement with consultants. The Borrower's performance\n            is rated as satisfactory. In terms of sustainability, those\n            components which were implemented during the project will be\n            sustainably serviced. The key lessons learned are as\n            follows. A lack of ownership of a project by government and\n            beneficiaries can lead to delays and difficulties. The Bank\n            had decided to finance this project as a means of\n            encouraging a quasi-monopoly to invest, but this approach\n            cannot succeed unless that quasi-monopoly is fully committed\n            to the project objectives. Convoluted on-lending\n            arrangements should not be attempted unless: both government\n            and borrower are highly committed; there are no simpler\n            alternatives; and the Bank is prepared to accept the risk of\n            delay or failure. If the borrower is unwilling to implement\n            technical assistance that the Bank deems necessary, this\n            should be deemed a cause to drop the project. Project\n            preparation documentation and reporting systems should\n            contain sufficient material for effective project monitoring\n            and supervision. Finally, Bank lending to private companies\n            should presume: that the company has no other alternative;\n            that the company is fully committed to the project's\n            objectives and investments; and that the project provides\n            very substantial economic and social benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Telephone System Expansion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Telephone System\n            Expansion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/731616/philippines-telephone-system-expansion-project","projn":"PH-Telephone System Exp -- P004577","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,ICT Policy and Strategies,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980901093050"},"subsc":"Telecommunications","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Bank lending,Bank management,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,bid\n            documents,Bidding,Borrower,borrowing,cities,commitments,competitors,consulting\n            services,debt,disbursement,disbursement delays,economic\n            conditions,equity investments,EXCHANGE\n            RATES,expenditure,financial strength,financing plans,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign assistance,foreign exchange,institutional\n            development,lenders,LOAN,loan commitment,loan\n            commitments,Loan Disbursements,local\n            government,municipalities,operating\n            expenses,procurement,productivity,programs,quality of\n            service,regulatory requirements,reporting,reporting\n            systems,revaluation\n            surplus,shareholders,syndication,technical\n            assistance,telecom\n            sector,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            Development,telecommunications networks,telecommunications\n            sector,telephone companies,telephone connections,telephone\n            density,telephone penetration,telephone services,telephones"},"1":{"cdata!":"Bank lending,Bank management,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,bid\n            documents,Bidding,Borrower,borrowing,cities,commitments,competitors,consulting\n            services,debt,disbursement,disbursement delays,economic\n            conditions,equity investments,EXCHANGE\n            RATES,expenditure,financial strength,financing plans,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign assistance,foreign exchange,institutional\n            development,lenders,LOAN,loan commitment,loan\n            commitments,Loan Disbursements,local\n            government,municipalities,operating\n            expenses,procurement,productivity,programs,quality of\n            service,regulatory requirements,reporting,reporting\n            systems,revaluation\n            surplus,shareholders,syndication,technical\n            assistance,telecom\n            sector,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            Development,telecommunications networks,telecommunications\n            sector,telephone companies,telephone connections,telephone\n            density,telephone penetration,telephone services,telephones"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF027050-PHRD-SOURTHERN PHILIPPINES TELECOMMUNICATIONS,TF026280-NETHERLANDS-2ND STRUCTURAL ADJ.
