The lessons learned indicated that\n            the project was streamlined to focus on legal reform.\n            Matching of the grant and the public-private dialogue\n            contributed to the success of the project. The project\n            performed better when the private sector increased its\n            involvement following a restructuring. The moderator that\n            was carrying out the technical work for the Private-Public\n            Commission did not engage the stakeholders, and the\n            technical work has not had as much impact as would have been\n            expected.
