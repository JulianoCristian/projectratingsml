Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (a) impressive achievements were made under the\n            project, particularly in the areas of policy reforms in the\n            liberalization of the coffee sub-sector, and in facilitating\n            the establishment of institutions for coffee development\n            (UCDA) and national research (NARO); (b) the survival of\n            Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) was necessary to avoid a total\n            collapse in the industry at the time of deregulation, and\n            this was reflected in the project's design. When market\n            reforms are being introduced, it is important that there is\n            a phased entry of private sector participation; and (c)\n            capacity building and gaining experience in procurement is\n            critical for smooth implementation and takes time.\n            Centralizing procurement for a multi-agency implemented\n            project helped in this area."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

The project consists of two\n            components.  Under the adjustment component the credit\n            finances agricultural sector recurrent imports in support of\n            significant policy reforms in the sector.  Actions to be\n            monitored include transfer of the responsibility for crop\n            financing from the Central Bank to commercial banks,\n            restructuring of the Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) as a\n            commercial marketing organization, rehabilitation of\n            cooperative unions, broadening of private sector\n            participation in coffee exports, reforms of the export\n            taxation system to introduce trade incentives, and\n            establishment of a semiautonomous national agricultural\n            research organization.  Under the investment component the\n            credit finances: (a) a Head-Start Program for Agricultural\n            Research and Extension to implement high priority\n            activities; (b) support for a program for land policy\n            research; (c) a program to strengthen agricultural sector\n            planning; (d) technical assistance for coffee subsector\n
