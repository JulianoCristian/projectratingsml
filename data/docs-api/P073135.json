Some lessons learned includes: conservancies\n            operate in large, open systems with highly variable climatic\n            conditions. Rainfall is extremely sporadic. Ungulates move\n            over vast areas in accordance with their availability for\n            grazing and browsing; predators roam in search of prey and;\n            elephants follow ancient migration routes. The effects of\n            climate change are likely to increase this variability.\n            Adaptive management that takes changing circumstances into\n            account is vital in such systems. ICEMA has filled important\n            gaps in natural resource management thanks to the adoption\n            of the Integrated-Ecosystem Management (IEM) approach by the\n            Community-based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program.\n            To succeed with IEM, it is important to: (i) introduce\n            standardized business development approaches based on a\n            vision of sustainability using a categorization of\n            conservancies and an integrated planning and implementation\n            approach; (ii) strengthen governance through compliance\n            systems, local level monitoring and financial management;\n            and (iii) strengthen the concept and capacity to carry and\n            implement ecological and economic zoning within each\n            conservancy including monitoring of the zoning rules by\n            internal and external conservancy users. Large scale\n            translocations of fauna to conservancies within differing\n            biomes and with different biodiversity, income-generating\n            and development needs were, until the inception of ICEMA,\n            largely untried and untested. Planning, monitoring and\n            evaluation are core aspects of conservancy activities, as\n            they allow for adaptive management through the strategic use\n            of gathered information. A number of Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems were put in place by Ministry\n            of Environment and Tourism (MET) and its development partners."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Namibia

processes. Develop viable income generating and livelihood\n            diversifying options among target groups. Draw up tourism\n            option plans and provide tourism awareness and training to\n            reduce nuisance to communities. Implement equitable\n            distribution of benefits due to tourism and support service\n            organization participation in facilitating discussions to\n            avoid internal community conflict. To encourage community\n            empowerment and power-sharing arrangements with the private\n            sector, provide training and facilitation to conservancies.\n            To control biophysical impacts resulting from tourism, like\n            the increased use of natural resources, groundwater and\n            river contamination, more of-road driving, and interference\n            with wildlife, develop land-use zoning and development\n            guidelines, monitor environmental compliance, strengthen\n            staff skills, and pass laws enforcing policy. To prevent\n            causing harmful impacts because of profit maximization,\n            promote a sustainable development approach. Carry out a\n            training needs assessment for each individual conservancy.\n            Develop a water management/water use plan. When\n            translocating game, enable livestock owners to access\n            alternative grazing areas and reintroduce predators only if\n            the benefits outweigh the costs.

of the\n            Integrated Community Based Ecosystem Management Project for\n            Namibia is \"to restore, secure and enhance key\n            ecosystem processes in targeted conservancies with\n            biodiversity and land conservation and sustainable use as a\n            goal.\"  The project's four inter-related\n            components together serve to consolidate, add value to, and\n            build on the previous achievements o f the National CBNRM\n            (Community Based Natural Resource Management)  Program. It\n            will foster the shift from traditional natural resource\n            management (mainly wildlife) to an integrated ecosystem\n            management approach in targeted conservancies thereby\n            enhancing globally significant biodiversity conservation and\n            reducing !and degradation while at the same time providing\n            increased income-generating activities. The project supports\n            targeted conservancies on communal lands complying with the\n            project's defined strategic criteria. The project also\n            provides institutional support to the Ministry o f\n            Environment and Tourism (MET), which is the governmental\n            lead agency responsible for implementing the CBNRM Program.\n            Project components 1 \"Ecosystem-based Income-Generating\n            Activities\" and 2 \"Sustainable Ecosystem\n            Management\" support site-specific on-the-ground\n            activities. Project component 3 \"Targeted Institutional\n            Support\" focuses on priority issues of the\n            institutional, policy, and financial CBNRM framework. All\n            three components are expected to provide replicable lessons\n            for the remaining conservancy network. Project component 4\n            \"Project Management Support\" aims to strengthen\n            the capacity of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism to\n            manage and supervise project
