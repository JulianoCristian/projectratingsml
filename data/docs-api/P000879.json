Finally, the\n            project provides (f) installation of distribution facilities\n            and associated equipment to expand supply in 10 towns; and\n            (g) associated engineering and project management services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Northern Grid Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Northern Grid Extension Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/01/740742/ghana-northern-grid-extension-project","projn":"GH-North Grid Extension -- P000879","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Power & Energy Conversion,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Ghana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926023117"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,Accounting,accounting\n            treatment,assets,auditors,Balance Sheets,Bank loans,bulk\n            supply,capacity utilization,capital\n            requirements,capitalization,Commercial energy,Commercial\n            energy consumption,consumer surplus,consumers,consumption\n            patterns,cost of electricity,crude\n            oil,debt,Deforestation,demand for\n            electricity,deposits,devaluation,domestic energy,Economic\n            Analysis,efficient energy use,EIB,Electricity,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity sales,Electricity Supply,energy\n            balance,energy consumption,Energy Policy,energy\n            prices,energy resource,Energy Resources,Energy Sector,energy\n            supplies,entitlements,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,expenditures,Exports,Financial Performance,financial\n            resources,financial strength,FISCAL YEAR,fishing,fixed\n            asset,Foreign Exchange,Forestry,Funds Flow,Grid,Grid\n            Extension,Grid Supply,Housing,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,indexation,inflation,interest\n            rate,kerosene,liquidity,mines,natural gas,oil,operating\n            expenses,operating losses,peak demand,petroleum,petroleum\n            product,petroleum product prices,Power,power plant,power\n            supply,Power System,Proven reserves,public enterprises,real\n            prices,residential electricity,resource mobilization,return\n            on investment,structural adjustment,technical\n            assistance,timber,transport,valuation,water supply,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,Accounting,accounting\n            treatment,assets,auditors,Balance Sheets,Bank loans,bulk\n            supply,capacity utilization,capital\n            requirements,capitalization,Commercial energy,Commercial\n            energy consumption,consumer surplus,consumers,consumption\n            patterns,cost of electricity,crude\n            oil,debt,Deforestation,demand for\n            electricity,deposits,devaluation,domestic energy,Economic\n            Analysis,efficient energy use,EIB,Electricity,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity sales,Electricity Supply,energy\n            balance,energy consumption,Energy Policy,energy\n            prices,energy resource,Energy Resources,Energy Sector,energy\n            supplies,entitlements,exchange rate,exchange\n            rates,expenditures,Exports,Financial Performance,financial\n            resources,financial strength,FISCAL YEAR,fishing,fixed\n            asset,Foreign Exchange,Forestry,Funds Flow,Grid,Grid\n            Extension,Grid Supply,Housing,imports,Income,Income\n            Statements,indexation,inflation,interest\n            rate,kerosene,liquidity,mines,natural gas,oil,operating\n            expenses,operating losses,peak demand,petroleum,petroleum\n            product,petroleum product prices,Power,power plant,power\n            supply,Power System,Proven reserves,public enterprises,real\n            prices,residential electricity,resource mobilization,return\n            on investment,structural adjustment,technical\n            assistance,timber,transport,valuation,water supply,working capital"}},"owner":"WB Off: Accra Western AFR 1 (AFCW1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"6301"},"facets":{}}}
