Nonetheless, regardless\n            of satisfactory performances, lessons address mainly, the\n            borrower's mixed performance during implementation, due\n            at the beginning to weak management, jeopardized by the lack\n            of political commitment. Though later on, policy dialogue\n            between the Government, and the Bank improved, it is\n            suggested that a comprehensive policy framework be developed\n            by the Government at an early stage, as a basis for donor\n            interventions in the sector, with full involvement of\n            relevant government officials. A strategy confined uniquely\n            to the health sector, may preclude the control of certain\n            diseases, i.e., plague, and cholera, which are spread as a\n            result of poverty, and unsanitary conditions; thus, a\n            complementary multi-sectoral approach would also address\n            measures to improve sanitation, and hygiene. Furthermore,\n            major reforms, which may be politically sensitive, and\n            potentially controversial, such as cost recovery, may better\n            be introduced all at once nationwide, rather than\n            progressively, provided the necessary preparatory work has\n            been achieved. Project design should include implementation\n            arrangements by the borrower, to allow flexible\n            coordination, and, realistic performance indicators should\n            be included in the design, to allow relevant monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
