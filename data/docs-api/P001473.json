The Bank provided an\n            important role in this project. Experience gained and main\n            lessons learned from the projects are the following: the two\n            projects demonstrated the difficulty of implementing\n            development projects in a volatile political, and economic\n            environment, and the need for the Bank to take strong action\n            if ill-advised policies threaten to undermine project\n            benefits. The complex and eventful history of the project\n            shows the risk of trying to implement a project when the\n            Bank and the Borrower are not able to reach a clear\n            understanding on project objectives and components. Finally,\n            Bank support for the project was kept alive principally for\n            the sake of maintaining good relations between the\n            Government and the Bank. It is believed that a stronger\n            stance when covenants were breached, and possibly\n            International Development Association (IDA) withdrawal from\n            the project, might have proved more effective in moving the\n            Government to take stronger and more effective action."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rapport d'evaluation r\u00e9trospective"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Morondava Irrigation\n            and Rural Development Project and First Village Livestock\n            and Rural Development Project (Vol. 2) : Rapport\n            d'evaluation r\u00e9trospective"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/12/15492024/madagascar-morondava-irrigation-rural-development-project-first-village-livestock-rural-development-project-vol-2-rapport-devaluation-r\u00e9trospective","projn":"MG-Morondava Irrigation -- P001473,MG-Livestock Ii-266771 -- P001477","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research,Regional Rural Development,Economic Theory & Research,Crops and Crop Management Systems","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","teratopic":"Rural Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Madagascar","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20111122012155"},"subsc":"(Historic)Livestock,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural machinery; Agricultural\n            training centers; Animal feed crops; Canals; Cattle;\n            Construction; Cotton; Cultivation; Dams; Disease control;\n            Drains; Earthmoving machinery; Extension services; Fencing;\n            Fertilizers; Fish culture; Gravity irrigation; Groundnuts;\n            Improvement; Maintenance & repair; Pasture & forage;\n            Production; Research centers; Rice; Roads & highways;\n            Rural development; Schools; Seeds; Swine; Tobacco; Tractors;\n            Veterinary services; Water supply; Wells,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural machinery; Agricultural\n            training centers; Animal feed crops; Canals; Cattle;\n            Construction; Cotton; Cultivation; Dams; Disease control;\n            Drains; Earthmoving machinery; Extension services; Fencing;\n            Fertilizers; Fish culture; Gravity irrigation; Groundnuts;\n            Improvement; Maintenance & repair; Pasture & forage;\n            Production; Research centers; Rice; Roads & highways;\n            Rural development; Schools; Seeds; Swine; Tobacco; Tractors;\n            Veterinary services; Water supply; Wells,,"}},"owner":"Anchor: MG/MU/KM/SC (AFCMG)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"5403","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Projet d'irrigation et\n            de D\u00e9veloppement Rural de la R\u00e9gion de Morondava et Premier\n            Projet d'elevage Villageois et de D\u00e9veloppement Rural"}}},"1558183":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1972/06/1558183/malagasy-republic-morondava-irrigation-rural-development-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1972/06/1558183/malagasy-republic-morondava-irrigation-rural-development-project","new_url":"1972/06/1558183/malagasy-republic-morondava-irrigation-rural-development-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/07/02/000178830_98101902190555/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/07/02/000178830_98101902190555/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"0322","docdt":"1972-06-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2002-07-02T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Malagasy Republic - Morondava Irrigation\n            and Rural Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Morondova Irrigation and Rural\n            Development Project area will be divided into three units.\n            The first, will be devoted to irrigated rice cultivation by\n            some 2,300 small farmers to be settled there.
