The lessons learned from this project include:\n            Political risks associated with privatization of key\n            infrastructure assets need to be addressed: 2) Governments\n            need to be made aware of the availability of internationally\n            accepted regulations on transport, utilities, banking and\n            other services. 3) Where a project implementation unit (PIU)\n            faces staffing and performance difficulties, a systematic\n            assessment is required during new project preparation to\n            ascertain the readiness and resource requirements of the PIU\n            to take on additional responsibilities. This project's\n            PIU seems to have been overwhelmed by the additional tasks\n            imposed on it resulting in some of the implementation\n            problems.    Capital markets in small economies need to be\n            realistically assessed:  5) Merits of sector versus\n            multi-sector regulation should be weighed: While the\n            benefits of centralizing regulatory capacity and authority\n            in a single agency seem obvious especially in a small\n            economy, the challenge of taking away regulatory authority\n            from established line Ministries and the perceived loss of\n            political power is not always easy for governments to manage effectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde -
