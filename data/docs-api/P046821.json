The following lessons were learned: A key factor\n            to ensure sustainability is the continuity of reform-minded\n            administrators. The departure of 'champions'\n            endangers the sustainability of modernization processes.\n            Finding adequate mechanisms to ensure sustainability has to\n            be a priority at the onset of the modernization process.\n            Distinguish between modernization and anti-corruption\n            efforts when tackling an agency's overhaul.  Accurately\n            diagnose corruption before embarking on a full-fledged\n            anticorruption campaign.  Different strategies exist with\n            respect to agency modernization. Use of consultants brings a\n            danger of generating a dependency or resistance on the part\n            of the bureaucracy.  Identify measurable landmarks to\n            demonstrate the progress made and ensure its sustainability.\n            Purposely encouraging bottom-up participation can foster\n            innovation, enhance ownership and strengthen sustainability.\n            Building a direct relation with the public can help top\n            agency managers   Rotating managers among the various\n            divisions can help management develop a more holistic\n            understanding of the overall agency  Public agencies can\n            play an important role in revitalizing their constituencies.\n            Losing focus becomes a challenge in institutional\n            development projects with a longer life span.  Maintaining\n            the impetus of modernization efforts remains a challenge,\n            particularly when reaching performance thresholds.\n            Distinguish between potential and actual savings when\n            designing monitoring and impact indicators"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - National Pension Administration\n            Technical Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - National Pension\n            Administration Technical Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6547121/argentina-national-pension-administration-technical-project","projn":"AR-Pension Ta -- P046821","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Insurance & Risk Mitigation,Banks & Banking Reform,Technology Industry,Public Sector Economics,Insurance Law","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development,Industry","count":"Argentina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060120144023"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Law and Development,Public Sector Development,Industry","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, accounting, affiliates,\n            applications, Auditing, audits, banks, beneficiaries,\n            capitalization, Central government, Citizen Participation,\n            claims processing, Components, computer equipment,\n            consolidation, coverage, decentralization, e-mail,\n            engineering, equipment, evasion, financial institutions,\n            financial management, fraud, Institutional Development,\n            insurance, legal framework, operating costs, Pension Funds,\n            pensions, programs, provincial governments, Public, public\n            agencies, Public expenditure, public sector, reorganization,\n            Retirement, San, savings, Social Security, Social Services,\n            Sustainability, Tax, Tax Administration, Technical\n            Assistance, telecommunications, transparency, unemployment\n            insurance, utilities, wages, Y2K"}},"owner":"Public Sector (LCSPS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF033884-ARGENTINA - PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT,TF035063-ARGENTINA - NATIONAL PENSION\n            ADMINISTRATION T.A.
