Ratings for the Lifelong Learning\n            and Training Project, and Science for the Knowledge Economy\n            Project, for Chile were as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was significant,\n            bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Higher Education, Improving Access Project for Colombia\n            were as follows: outcome was satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons included: student loans may be an\n            effective instrument to curb student dropout rates in higher\n            education and increase learning. An impact evaluation of the\n            project suggests this strongly by comparing drop-out rates\n            of beneficiaries with those of otherwise similar\n            non-beneficiaries. Since beneficiaries were generally poor,\n            the program also improved equity through lowering dropout\n            rates. However, as drop-out rates remain high, addressing\n            student drop-out rates may need other actions, including\n            adequate remedial programs and counseling. A better design\n            may focus more strongly on accreditation of providers, while\n            relying more on providers to identify the demand for skills\n            by firms and the demand

satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: lifelong learning and training is crucial both\n            from equity and efficiency perspectives. In the context of\n            Chile's lifelong learning and training system, the\n            development of human capital is solidly grounded in the\n            country's needs to support its integration into the\n            world economy as well as its social deficit. An adequate\n            lifelong learning and training system necessarily involves\n            diverse players that are in themselves heterogeneous, both\n            in the public and private spheres. The success of Chile\n            Califica was not the result of having a strong champion with\n            high visibility within the public or private spheres who\n            advocated for the development of a lifelong learning and\n            training system. Rather, it was the result of gradually\n            introducing an overall framework that addressed many of the\n            weaknesses in the existing educational and training system\n            in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Although the\n            implementation of the project at the regional level resulted\n            in added complexity, it ensured its relevancy at the\n            regional level. While other developing countries can\n            certainly learn from this innovative project, Chile's\n            special characteristics mean that these ideas cannot be\n            exported easily or wholesale."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile -
