Some lessons learned included:\n            rural institutions can play a key service delivery role in\n            the absence of strong state capacity, but sustained support\n            is needed to ensure their good governance and capacity to\n            provide services to the poor. Social accountability tools\n            are important elements of a project intended to be\n            implemented through village-level organizations. A\n            market-based approach to developing the smallholder sector\n            requires an upfront analysis of skills, knowledge, and\n            capacity in order to engage in various value chain\n            activities, such as marketing. Simple technologies work best\n            in poor rural communities. Behavior and incentives, both\n            individual and at the policy level, should be placed at the\n            heart of programs geared toward supporting sustainable land

Some lessons\n            learned included: the design of projects for implementation\n            under decentralized arrangements, using country systems,\n            should critically examine the existing capacity at all\n            levels. In order to build the strong decentralization\n            capacity at local, district, and national levels, the\n            project should have considered a long-term approach; using\n            flexible lending instruments for example, adjustable program\n            loan (APL) in order to ensure consistent and continued\n            support for a longer period of time than the planned five\n            year period. The sustainability of community empowerment\n            requires continued government follow-up, facilitating\n            appropriate linkages with service providers and agribusiness\n            value-chain players. There is need for clear targeting and\n            beneficiary selection criteria in order to maximize project\n            impact. It is always good practice to ensure that the\n            targeting and beneficiary selection criteria is well spelt\n            out in the project implementation manual, and that its\n            application is as participatory as possible to ensure that\n            it is fully understood by all stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Market Led Smallholder\n            Development in

The restructuring is aligned with\n            the provisions made for project supervision and the changes\n            do not involve any changes to the project development\n            objective. The changes are minor and cover four areas: i)\n            adjusting the end of project target for the performance\n            indicator on savings and loans groups to a more realistic\n            level to account for implementation delays; ii) revising the\n            financial agreement to reflect the remapping of the project\n            implementing agency to a different ministry; iii)\n            reallocating International Development Association (IDA)\n            proceeds to finance increased project coordination costs;\n            and iv) extend the closing date by six months to September\n            30, 2013, in order to align with the closing date of the\n            co-financing from the Global Environment Fund (GEF) grant.\n            The reallocation of IDA proceeds is needed to respond to\n            changes in project coordination and management costs\n            expected to result from improvements made to project\n            coordination and implementation arrangements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique -
