Of the\n            latter, some 85 percent are unpaved and susceptible to\n            closure for up to 100 days per year because of rain. Road\n            development has been concentrated on paving the more heavily\n            trafficked roads and expanding the network to connect\n            economic and population centers. Adequate maintenance is\n            critical and improvements are required to meet growing\n            traffic volumes and facilitate the development of new\n            agricultural areas.
