However, the consistent\n            ratings in both operations show likely sustainability, and\n            satisfactory performances from both the Bank, and Borrower.\n            The experience of the two projects, confirm key lessons from\n            the Operations Evaluation Department as follows. The overly\n            ambitious ASAL project design - in addressing both\n            agriculture sector/trade and water reforms - was limited by\n            political constraints, given farmers could not at the same\n            time, pay more for water, and be constricted by the\n            elimination of subsidies, and loss of import protection.\n            Instead, the ASAL could have been an appropriate instrument\n            for institutional reform of the water sector, had the Bank\n            better understood the government's concerns on social,\n            poverty, and employment impacts of higher agricultural water\n            tariffs, and worked in a participatory, more incremental\n            approach to address these concerns. This harmed the\n            Bank's credibility, for although the cross-sectoral and\n            strategic framework for water and agriculture, were\n            supportive (even accepted by stakeholders) of increased\n            water tariffs, at approval time it was clear that a second\n            water tariff increase would be politically unrealistic.\n            Thus, the second tranche release undermined donor\n            partnerships, and mislead the government towards wrongful\n            tariff increases. The above confirms that reforms cannot be\n            imposed, and the Bank needs to be more sensitive to the\n            political economy of reform, acceptability, and timing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Agriculture Sector Adjustment, and\n            Agricultural Sector Technical Support Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Agriculture Sector\n

interventions, succeeded in helping raise the overall\n            conveyance system efficiency in the Jordan Valley to 80\n            percent. the sustainability of project investments is likely\n            because of the innovation made to assign responsibility for\n            the bulk of the physical investments to farmers, and the\n            human capacity developed. Overall World Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated as satisfactory, although there were\n            delays in implementation. Key lessons learned included the\n            following: Decentralizing investments downstream of pumping\n            stations to private operators, especially farmers, would\n            help promote the sustainability of the irrigation system at\n            that level. A first step was made to relocate farm turnouts\n            from their customary location on access roads to on-farm,\n            with individual farmers being held accountable for them and\n            the related costs recovered directly from them in cases of\n            meter tampering. Apart from promoting sustainability, this\n            approach has also reduced the fiscal costs of these\n            investments. Although some monitoring of the project's\n            effects and some monitoring capacity was built in to the\n            agriculture ministry, these efforts slowed and were not\n            effectively used by the government to address the impacts of\n            sector reforms on the poor. Internal clearance mechanisms\n            used by the Government to review small equipment purchases\n            resulted in needless delays and transaction costs. he Bank\n            for
