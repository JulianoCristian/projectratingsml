A\n            shortage of funds brought implementation to a halt after two\n            years from the beginning of activities at the community\n            level, and disbursement of grants to the communities was\n            suspended. Eventually funds were obtained to resume\n            implementation, but the project closed without attaining\n            full completion. Some lessons learned included: large-scale\n            participatory community planning can increase the impact and\n            sustainability of the grassroots development process.\n            Involving a large number of communities in a participatory\n            rural appraisal (PRA) exercise is very challenging, but the\n            Ugandan experience demonstrated that it is possible. There\n            is reason to believe that the implementation structure that\n            delivered in Uganda can be adapted for replication in other\n            developing countries. This mechanism turned out to be very\n            time consuming. In spite of this, the approach has been\n            given high ratings from all involved in implementation and\n            should be encouraged. Where communities are involved, it is\n            crucial to complete activities once they commence. For two\n            years, project communities were unsure if the project will\n            continue. This lowered project credibility and raised\n            planning fatigue. Such uncertainty places community\n            motivation in jeopardy. The original plan to phase-in\n            activities in different districts might have prevented the\n            time gap between community action plan (CAP) planning and\n            implementation. Also, to regain project credibility in the\n            communities, it was important to complete community grants\n            that were already planned."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Nutrition and Early Childhood\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Nutrition and Early\n            Childhood Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/9552202/uganda-nutrition-early-childhood-development-project","projn":"UG-Nutrit.
