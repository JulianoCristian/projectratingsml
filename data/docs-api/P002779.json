The objectives of the project were to\n            achieve long-term growth by increasing the national\n            production of cashewnuts for export, and the production of\n            coconuts for the domestic oil market.  Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was marginally satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as\n            follows: (i) flexibility is important in the implementation\n            of project activities, to allow for changing circumstances,\n            priorities and initial project assumptions that prove to be\n            invalid;  (ii) reservations concerning the cost\n            effectiveness of the dual management structure of the\n            project were justified; (iii) a single CCTP management unit\n            agreed to during the MTR was more effective;(iv) mechanisms\n            for procurement and disbursement were consistently\n            problematical for project implementors; (v) more time is\n            needed to complete research objectives in plant breeding\n            aspects; (vi) greater allowance for failure of improved\n            plant materials should be factored into project appraisals;\n            (vii) building upon or scaling up previous pilot operations\n            can help assure a greater degree of success; and (viii) an\n            effective mid-term review can help in restructuring or\n            putting a project onto a solid basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Cashew and Coconut
