Some lessons learned included: sustained\n            sector improvement requires higher level alignment at both\n            political and bureaucratic levels and overall enabling\n            fiscal and fiduciary frameworks. Lessons from PEDPC have\n            confirmed that leadership and political championship are\n            critical for successful implementation of sustainable\n            reforms. Complementary non-lending analytical and advisory\n            support and sustained dialogue is essential. Bank engagement\n            at the highest political levels played a key role in\n            supporting the new government in implementing improvements\n            in sector governance. At the same time, technical inputs\n            from Bank staff through, for example, analytical reports and\n            a variety of just-in-time policy and technical assistance\n            notes supported design and implementation. Given the\n            educational context in Pakistan, it is important to\n            simultaneously address the issues of school access and\n            quality. Without quality, access may start showing a\n            downward trend over time. There is deeper coordination\n            required between putting children in schools and ensuring\n            that schools are the learning places that can contribute to\n            children's development. Systematic communication can\n            play a key role in ensuring wider understanding and\n            ownership. Strategic communications can increase\n            understanding among the general public, media and civil\n            society, local communities as well as internal stakeholders\n            such as teachers or other employees. This involves two way\n            communications and extensive consultations. An outcome of\n            such communication and creation of wide ownership was the\n            continuation of Punjab Education Sector Reform Program\n            (PESRP) when the leadership and government of the province\n            underwent a change. Focused and consistent messages in the\n            government and World Bank dialogue can be critical to\n            ensuring continued implementation progress even after\n            project preparation and approval."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fourth Punjab Education\n            Development Policy Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Fourth Punjab\n

Sector\n            Development Policy Credit will be the first in a second\n            series of three development policy credits to support the\n            Government of Punjab's Education Sector Reform Program\n            (PESRP) which has entered its second phase. The operation\n            will provide continued support to an ongoing reform program\n            which is being deepened and carried forward by a government\n            that has demonstrated its commitment, ownership, and a good\n            track record. The objectives of the Project are to improve\n            performance and quality of school education to improve\n            student learning outcomes; improve school participation and\n            retention rates; and reduce gender and regional disparities\n            (grades 1 - 10). The operation is based on the reform\n            program's three pillars: a) enhance fiscal\n            sustainability and improve the fiduciary environment to: (i)\n            ensure that public expenditure continues to be increased for\n            education at both provincial and district levels in\n            accordance with sector needs; (ii) strengthen the\n            districts' financing capacity and ensure that adequate\n            resources are transferred to districts to meet education\n            needs; (iii) increase transparency of financial management\n            and procurement processes and practices; and (iv) strengthen\n            provincial and district capacities to monitor financial\n            flows; b) increase equitable access to education and improve\n            the quality and relevance of education. Access agenda\n            focuses on programs to: (i) increase participation,\n            retention and completion rates, especially for girls; and\n            (ii) encourage the participation of private sector. The\n            quality agenda seeks to: (i) improve school performance and\n            student learning outcomes; and (ii) improve quality of\n            learning through better teaching practices, better textbooks\n            and a credible examination system; and c) improve public\n            education sector governance and management to: (i)\n            strengthen sector planning and policy development capacity\n            of the provincial education department; (ii) strengthen\n            district education departments' management and\n            monitoring capacity; (iii) strengthen monitoring and\n            evaluation to gauge education sector performance; and (iv)\n            enhance school based management, and monitoring of school\n            performance by communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fourth Punjab Education\n            Development Policy Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Fourth Punjab\n
