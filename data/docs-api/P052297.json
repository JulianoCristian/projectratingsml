This also\n            facilitates a sustainable employment for the poor, and\n            women, adopting as well information dissemination among\n            targeted groups, based on an eligibility criteria for\n            program participation, on adequate funding support, and\n            established contractual obligations between employer and\n            employee beneficiaries. However, it should be noted that\n            human resources development projects exploring alternate\n            delivery mechanisms, would benefit from comprehensive tracer\n            studies as a project output, ensuring relevancy of targeted\n            resources, addressing the evaluation perceptions, and\n            statistically measuring progress. Moreover, the learning\n            nature of pilot projects, would greatly benefit from the\n            inclusion of forums designed to reinforce, and evaluate\n            implementation vis-a-vis the achievement of development\n            objectives, and, further exchange recommendations.\n            Nonetheless, although the impact assessment study\n            demonstrates the potential to leverage the unemployed poor\n            into the work force, the project however lost its potential\n            to replicate/extend benefits to critical groups, as a result\n            of cancellation with no appropriate reference to\n            stakeholders.
