Some\n            lessons learned included: decentralization is a long-term\n            and comprehensive effort that requires political support.\n            The major changes expected are likely to meet resistance\n            from some institutions. Therefore considerable effort is\n            needed for new systems to be established and officials to be\n            educated and convinced to accept changes. To achieve\n            successful decentralization, champions are required on the\n            community side to make pressure on the central government to\n            relinquish authority and undertake further reforms to lead\n            to effective decentralization including fiscal\n            decentralization. On the Government's side, change\n            agents with strong leadership and the right vision is\n            required to undertake the courageous reforms for effective\n            decentralization. Fiscal capabilities are critical to\n            long-term viability of local governments. In order for\n            decentralization reforms to be sustainable, they need to be\n            accompanied by effective fiscal decentralization. While\n            local governments have rights over some taxation schemes,\n            the poverty levels make it difficult for them to collect a\n            substantial share of these revenues therefore limiting them\n            in their ability to undertake investment activities.\n            Medium-term efforts should focus on fiscal issues, including\n            sustainable transfers from the central government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -

Village Communities Support\n            Program Project : additional financing"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The additional grant to the Village\n            Communities Support Program will cover project scale-up to\n            increase the number of communities benefiting from project\n            support in order to leverage and build upon a better than\n            expected implementation capacity and results to date. The\n            additional financing would also enable preservation of this\n            capacity and implementation momentum while the second APL\n            (Adaptable Program Lending instrument) phase is under\n            preparation. The Credit supporting the Project was\n            originally extended until December 31, 2005 to support the\n            process leading to local elections to replace appointed\n            rural development community (Communaute Rude de\n            Developpement (CRD)) leaders by democratically elected\n            representatives. These elections are planned for December\n            18, 2005, and were the sole remaining trigger for the\n            Project's second phase. At the present time, remaining\n            resources from the International Development Association\n            (IDA) for FY06 are, however, insufficient tofinance the\n            project's second phase (estimated at US$35 million);\n            while it is expected that sufficient FY07 resources are\n            available.  Additional Financing, which would have a closing\n            date of June 30,2007, would thus also help bridge the gap\n            between the end of the first phase and the start-up of the\n            second phase, avoiding loss of momentum in the program.\n            Moreover, as the project has been increasingly used as a\n            vehicle for providing services to communities, two Bank\n            operations (the Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project and the\n            Education for All Project) will face implementation problems\n            if the project's funding is interrupted. Following\n            Midterm Review, the Project had scaled-up its geographic\n            coverage from the original target of 100 to 146 CRDs. The\n            Additional Financing will enable the project to continue\n            capacity-building activities, and support the implementation\n            and updating of local development plans in these 146 CRDs\n            and ensure that the new representative local governments\n            have the capacity to lead participatory local development\n            planning and implementation processes. Continued support\n            will be a stabilizing apolitical influence in participating\n            CRDs. Given that the project covers half the country, it\n            could become a destabilizing factor if a longer-term\n            interruption in financing occurs. After the elections,\n            continued support will be necessary to provide training to\n            newly elected CRD presidents, who will likely be different\n            from those presently in place, as these have been appointed\n            by the central Government. In addition, continued support to\n            the nascent democratization process implies continued\n            investment support to local development to cement achievements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -

The project's objectives are to:\n            1) establish an operationally effective and efficient,\n            decentralized system for local development; and 2) increase\n            access of the rural population to basic infrastructure and\n            services. There are four project components. First, Local\n            Investment Fund (LIF) will stimulate local development by\n            transferring grants directly to Rural Development\n            Communities. The fund will support basic infrastructure\n            identified by the communities. Second, support to the local\n            development process will focus on improving the\n            institutional and regulatory framework and equipping Guinea\n            with the tools to analyze and implement local development;\n            increasing local mobilization; and improving capacity of\n            local participants to take charge of their own development\n            and sustain their investments. Third, maintenance and\n            rehabilitation of rural roads will develop a strategy for\n            the management of the rural roads network, implement a\n            priority maintenance and rehabilitation program and support\n            the reorganization of the Maintenance Unit of the National\n            Directorate of Rural Engineering Services (DNGR). Finally,\n            project coordination and management will handle the\n            day-to-day management of the project activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Village Communities Support

basic infrastructure and services. The\n            proposed project has been placed in environmental screening\n            category B, and an Environmental Management Plan that\n            provides support for a series of practical actions to\n            address potential environmental issues has been prepared.\n            The small-scale community infrastructures to be constructed\n            under the program will have limited negative environmental\n            impacts. To mitigate potentially adverse environmental\n            impacts, agent de developpement communautaire (ADCs) will be\n            trained in environmental management through on-the-job\n            training programs.
