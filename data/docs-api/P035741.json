Lessons learned from this\n            project included: (a) the reaffirmation of the viability of\n            a decentralized approach to environmental management. By\n            transferring decisions and implementation down to the State\n            level, the Federal Government was able to accomplish several\n            important goals: (1) leverage policy and regulatory change\n            at the State level; (2) generate enthusiasm, energy and\n            counterpart funding for state selected priorities; (3) build\n            capacity for environmental management at the State level;\n            (b) even in a nominally decentralized system, there may be\n            some resistance by central government (i.e. Ministry of\n            Finance) to allow decentralized decision making. Often this\n            resistance comes indirectly in the form of fiscal controls;\n            (c) the importance of building an effective communications\n            component into the project in that success of a project may\n            often depend on its capacity to identify key stakeholders\n            and to communicate with them effectively, in both\n            directions; (d) the lack of a comprehensive baseline to\n            measure actual improvements in environmental quality through\n            the implementation of subprojects at the state level is an\n            important lesson from Second National Environmental Project;\n            (e) the delays encountered in the signing of contracts owing\n            to slow administrative procedures by UNDP: Ministry of\n            Finance has relied on UNDP as a service provider for letting\n            contracts, which often experienced delays affecting project\n            implementation; and (f) the flexible methodology provided by\n            Ministry of Finance for determining the State's\n            environmental priorities which was often not closely\n            monitored and which opened the door to arbitrary decisions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second National Environmental Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Second National\n            Environmental
