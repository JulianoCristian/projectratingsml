Some\n            lessons learned includes: the project would have benefited\n            from more thematic focus, and subsequently fewer, yet\n            implementable activities. Indeed, development needs and\n            demands are always numerous, but an adequate balance is\n            always necessary between a meaningful and manageable scope\n            and the instinct to go for more. Too much flexibility leaves\n            the project hostage to situational, spur-of-the-moment\n            preferences by project proponents, hampering implementation\n            pace. A project's monitoring and evaluation\n            arrangements framework should be finalized at appraisal, and\n            be meaningfully connected through its monitoring and impact\n            variables to the Project development Objective (PDO) and the\n            results framework. Setting key realistic expectations in\n            areas of policy reforms, regulations and institutional\n            strengthening is a key pre-requisite for successful and\n            timely implementation of project's that address\n            institutional modernization. In addition, to the actual\n            merits of corrective measures, their timely processing\n            allows for a sufficient time horizon in the\n            post-restructuring implementation phase, thus making\n            restructurings more meaningful for achieving results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Rural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Rural
