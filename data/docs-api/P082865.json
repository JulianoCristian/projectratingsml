The overall outcome of these three projects\n            is rated satisfactory, and the performance of the Bank and\n            the Borrower is also rated as satisfactory. Lessons learned:\n            constant engagement with the client is important via a rich\n            technical dialogue and varied portfolio. The multi-sectoral\n            PLaRSSAL program team worked with the Government of Colombia\n            (GoC) in a wide range of lending and non-lending activities,\n            which facilitated the preparation of the program in two key\n            ways. First, the GoC and Bank teams developed a good working\n            relationship over many years. Second, the Bank team, through\n            this continued relationship was well versed in the\n            objectives, strategies, results-management, and outputs of\n            the social sectors, allowing for a greater focus on strategy\n            and implementation in the development of the program. A\n            commitment by the clients to implement a well-designed\n            Government program. The national development plan defined\n            each social institution's strategic objectives for the\n            Uribe administration, thereby providing a base upon which to\n            design the Bank's program. The social institutions were\n            committed to implementing the strategies and meeting the\n            quantifiable targets and saw the value added of Bank support\n            in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - First and Second series of\n            Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment\n            Loans and a Third Labor Reform and Social Development Policy Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - First and Second\n            series of Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural\n            Adjustment Loans and a Third Labor Reform and Social\n            Development Policy Loan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/12/9375193/colombia-first-second-series-programmatic-labor-reform-social-structural-adjustment-loans-third-labor-reform-social-development-policy-loan","projn":"CO-3rd Prog.

         satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            Lessons are suggested as follows. An emphasis on\n            results-based management, involving clear and measurable\n            indicators, and a focus on outputs and outcomes, rather than\n            inputs and processes, is critical to performance monitoring,\n            revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the program, and\n            allowing for immediate corrections when the processes are\n            not reaching the desired results. Focusing on program\n            outcomes permits the inclusion of many sectors, which would\n            be difficult to manage in a series of operations if the\n            outcomes for each sector were not clearly defined and\n            measurable. A rich program of investment Loans, sector\n            studies, and adjustment loans in other sectors is necessary\n            to fill-out the labor and social reform program. While the\n            series of programmatic labor reform structural adjustment\n            loans have successfully met their goals, the Government and\n            the Bank team understand that they have a specific and\n            limited role. Other complementary Bank instruments are\n            necessary to efficiently support the Government's\n            fulfillment of its development plan. Further lessons address\n            the importance of a strong and sustained dialogue between\n            the Bank and the Government, and, a strong coordinating role."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -

In\n            addition, an integrated, and more efficient social\n            protection system will be developed, and, institutions for\n            regular impact evaluation, and public oversight of social\n            protection programs will be established. The project will\n            specifically focus on: greater labor demand via employer\n            incentives, and reductions in legal barriers to employment;\n            increased coverage, efficiency, and targeting of social\n            protection programs; quality and coverage improvements in\n            the education sector; and, impact evaluation and social\n            oversight of major social programs. Notwithstanding, several\n            risks were identified: the overall political context, namely\n            the internal conflict, and violence associated with illegal\n            drug activity, the fiscal pressures, external economic and\n            political shocks, opposition by special interest groups, the\n            financial viability of the health reform, and, the\n            sustainability of reforms that incur costs in the short-run.\n            However, throughout the reform process, several actions are\n            being undertaken to mitigate these risks, that is, both the\n            Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) loans,\n            studies, and technical assistance support the health sector\n            reform, and, provide further support via projects, technical\n            assistance, and studies to measure the impacts of social\n            programs, promote the result for better program design and\n            management, and disseminate findings to the public to\n            strengthen the citizen's support of the reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
