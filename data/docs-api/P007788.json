The main lessons are\n            addressed as follows. The importance of institutional\n            building is largely emphasized by the transformation of the\n            Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI), attributable\n            to targeted technical assistance, training and studies, as\n            well as to the integration of the project unit within the\n            Ministry itself, staff continuity, and sustained involvement\n            by the Bank, in coordination with other donors. Nonetheless,\n            as dependable as the funding for the road maintenance fund\n            (RMF) has been thus far, there is a long-term sustainability\n            risk, derived from current reliance on budgetary financing.\n            Hence, with the passing of the RMF Law, an agreement by the\n            International Development Association (IDA) is recommended,\n            for a Government time bound program, to ensure automatic\n            funding of the RMF. Conversely, the cost effective, and\n            sustainable methods of maintaining the road network in a\n            resource constrained environment, engendered additional\n            benefits: increased roads security; employment generation;\n            and, the ability to provide assistance to flood stricken\n            victims following the damages of Hurricane Mitch.\n            Furthermore, this need for flexibility in disaster prone\n            areas, facilitated the Bank's reallocation of funds, in\n            the Government's efforts for financing remedial works.\n            And, despite procurement delays caused by lack of\n            familiarity with procurement procedures, it is clear that\n            road construction would have been further delayed, had the\n            task team not undertaken pre-qualification at the stage of\n            project cycle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua -
