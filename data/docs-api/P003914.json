The sustainability of project activities and\n            achievements is likely (except in Maluku), but not\n            assured.Overall, both World Bank and Borrower performances\n            are rated as satisfactory. The project provided specific\n            lessons related to iodine deficiency disease (IDD) and\n            midwives: The national IDD strategy should differentiate\n            responses according to local situations. It is essential to\n            recognize the role of private sector producers, wholesalers,\n            and retailers in the salt industry and the importance of\n            improving efficiency in salt production and processing.\n            Updated information is needed on both the IDD status of the\n            population in different regions and the iodine content of\n            salt consumed at the household level. The government's\n            midwives initiatives need to address both supply and demand\n            factors, and to be locally grounded and focused. Upgrading\n            the skills of midwives requires strengthening of\n            pre-services as well as in-service training. Improving\n            effectiveness will also require intensified supervision and\n            support, directed especially at the more recent graduates.\n            The village midwife's role needs to be widened to a\n            number of other community level health services. Lessons of\n            broader applicability pertain to: the complexity of project\n            design, matching the project objective with government\n            capacity, the need for government commitment, developing a\n            strategy that responds to local conditions, and\n            disseminating study results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Third Community Health and\n

      effectiveness of community health and nutrition\n            interventions in five provinces (West Java, Central Java,\n            Maluku, East Nusa Tenggara and Irian Jaya). This will be\n            accomplished by: (a) building provincial and kabupaten\n            capacity to plan, implement and evaluate safe motherhood,\n            child survival and nutrition interventions; and (b) by\n            strengthening the capacity of the central Ministry of\n            Health. The Provincial Service Delivery and Capacity\n            Development component consists of interventions in safe\n            motherhood, child survival nutrition and health education.\n            Selected kabupaten in each province will implement newly\n            designed approaches to each intervention which will be\n            evaluated by kabupaten and provincial staff prior to\n            expansion to additional kabupaten within each province.
