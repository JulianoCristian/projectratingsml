Some lessons learned\n            included: there is a need for improving traffic forecasting\n            and related economic analysis for expressways. As\n            China's road network increases in complexity and\n            provides a range of alternative routes for travelling\n            between two points, traffic forecast also becomes\n            increasingly complex and subject to a higher degree of\n            uncertainty than in the past. The forecast is especially\n            difficult in the case of expressways whose main traffic is\n            likely to be long-distance, since this requires a broader\n            network analysis and is further complicated by competing\n            expressways whose expected completion time is normally not\n            known at the time of project appraisal. Rural road\n            components in China highway project often use the change in\n            gross domestic product (GDP), before and after the rural\n            road improvements in the areas where the roads are located,\n            as an indicator of the impact of such investments. A more\n            appropriate way to assess the impact of such improvement\n            would involve measuring the reduction of poverty in similar\n            socioeconomic areas as a counterfactual, instead of, or in\n            addition to, comparing poverty levels before and after the\n            improvements. Still, the projects need to find a proper\n            balance in the selection of indicators between simplicity on\n            the one hand, and capacity to reflect the effect of\n            interventions on outcomes on the other. Many safety\n            improvements were identified and implemented during the\n            construction of the expressway and the rural roads.\n            Effective road safety improvements during implementation\n            appears to be learned from the two main factors: (i) there\n            are normally not sufficient details provided in the\n            engineering drawings, and (ii) decent technical knowledge is\n            still required to ensure that road can achieve the maximum\n            safety despite the recent major progress in the\n            understanding of road safety issues among professional\n            staff. This lesson suggests that the engineering documents\n            should be modified to ensure that all safety measures are\n            clearly described and listed in such documents, and that\n            continuous training is required on road safety design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Anhui Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Anhui Highway

Project, this\n            environmental assessment describes the measures to avoid,\n            mitigate, or otherwise compensate for adverse impacts that\n            might result. Although the report elaborates on mitigation\n            measures that will be incorporated into the project design,\n            this abstract will focus solely on measures to alleviate\n            impacts during the construction and operation phases. During\n            construction, to protect biodiversity, restore temporary\n            land uses; notify forest authorities first before\n            undertaking activities in sensitive woodland areas or near\n            natural habitats; avoid noisy construction at night; define\n            protective zones or build protection/walls/slopes; carefully\n            select borrow pits and waste disposal sites; strictly\n            control wood product usage; and provide contractors\n            education and training. Other measures to control noise\n            include restricting the operation of heavy machinery during\n            the daytime, erecting temporary noise barriers, and\n            redirecting traffic during the day while banning traffic\n            altogether at night. To reduce adverse impacts to surface\n            water, use cofferdam techniques in bridge column\n            construction and completely isolate work areas; wait until\n            low flow period to do river crossing construction\n            activities; and treat sewage before discharging. To minimize\n            air pollution, spray water to suppress dust; locate mixing\n            stations and other emissions sources leeward, far enough\n            from sensitive receptors; and cover dump trucks with canvass\n            and parking places with bamboo or straw sheet. To preserve\n            cultural relics, halt work until archeologists can examine\n            \"chance finds\" and contractors will receive\n            training in identifying and protecting cultural relics.\n            During the operational phase, to protect the ecosystem,\n            build pest management stations, inspect motor vehicles, ban\n            vehicle horn blowing in places wildlife frequent, and\n            establish emergency procedures to save wounded animals.
