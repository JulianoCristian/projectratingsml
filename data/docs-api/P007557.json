The\n            loan was closed on June 30, 1991, four years behind\n            schedule. The last disbursement was on June 30, 1991; was\n            canceled by the Borrower. The project had a delayed start-up\n            and an extended implementation period. This was because of\n            counterpart funding constraints resulting from the adverse\n            macroeconomic environment caused by the 1982 economic crisis\n            triggered by the oil price slump. The project became\n            effective in December 19, 1980 and was closed in June 30,\n            1991, after four extensions, five years later than the\n            expected implementation period of seven years. The\n            Government had to adjust the timing and scope of its\n            investment program and project implementation. In 1984 the\n            project was amended and separated into two phases under the\n            Government's stabilization program, which was initiated\n            in 1982. The project was negatively affected by an\n            unfavorable macroeconomic environment, institutional\n            instability, and severe funding constraints. This finding\n            confirms the importance of a sound macroeconomic and\n            institutional context as a condition for successful project\n            implementation. Despite the macroeconomic problems, the\n            project demonstrates what can be achieved if borrower and\n            Bank are flexible in revising a project's original\n            scope. The main achievements were the completion of a major\n            storage dam (Chilatan), the advanced stage of construction\n            of the left and right irrigation systems and entrepreneurial\n            development of high value cropping systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Apatzingan Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Apatzingan Irrigation
