Some lessons learned\n            included: malnutrition in Guatemala is the result of a\n            number of factors, some of them culturally embedded.\n            Successful changes in behavior require a longer\n            implementation period in order to make a lasting impact and\n            may require a longer support period so as to become more\n            institutionalized. The first year of Project implementation\n            was spent hiring staff and establishing and adjusting\n            project design, reducing the implementation period in\n            certain jurisdictions. Originally the Project design had\n            coverage expanding to 90 jurisdictions but as the start date\n            was postponed by two years, the project expanded to over 140\n            jurisdictions. As a result, in some jurisdictions the\n            project was only implemented for two years, reducing the\n            ability to support a behavioral change in the target\n            population. The team\u0092s strategy of holding shorter but more\n            frequent missions, as well as a focus on shorter terms\n            achievements provided easier implementation objectives.\n            Agreeing on specific short-term action plans with the\n            client, setting specific goals and deadlines was crucial in\n            keeping project momentum. Constant interaction with the\n            client through video and audio conferences, frequent\n            missions, and the use of consultants with experience in\n            implementing similar projects also helped with implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Maternal and Infant Health and\n            Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Maternal and

objective of the\n            Maternal and Infant Health and Nutrition Project is to\n            support the Government of Guatemala to a) improve maternal\n            and infant health in the

targeted by the project. This project\n            paper includes: to introduce three changes in the project\n            documents as follows: 1) extend the project closing date for\n            five months from December 31, 2012 to May 30, 2013 to allow\n            for the completion of critical activities; 2) reallocate\n            funds among project disbursement categories; and 3) formally\n            revise targets for eight indicators and description of two\n            indicators, as well as include three intermediate results\n            indicators in the results monitoring framework. These\n            changes will i) allow the project to complete the few\n            remaining activities which have been delayed as a result of\n            changes in the Ministry of Health and related modifications\n            in administrative and financial procedures; ii) reassign\n            funds to take into account actual expenditures and the\n            projects future needs; and iii) align certain targets with\n            what can be realistically achieved based on implementation\n            experience and prevailing country context, as well as adjust\n            the description of two indicators: one to specify three\n            programs referred to and the other in order to accurately\n            reflect established reporting practice with World Bank, also\n            include three core indicators in line with World Bank's\n            health, nutrition, and population sector requirements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala -

Maternal and Infant Health and\n            Nutrition Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Maternal and Infant Health and\n            Nutrition Project for Guatemala aims to improve maternal and\n            infant health in the project's 40 areas of\n            intervention; and to reduce chronic malnutrition among\n            children younger than 2 years of age in the rural areas of\n            the 70 municipalities targeted by the project. This\n            extension was granted to enable completion of civil works in\n            35 maternal and child health care centers under component\n            one and design and implementation of a comprehensive\n            monitoring and evaluation system for the nutrition and\n            health intervention under component three. A careful review\n            of future project expenditures indicates that not all of the\n            estimated funds for category of consultants' services,\n            training, and audits, category 4-b of health services under\n            second part of the project, category five of operating\n            costs, and category eight of unallocated will be needed and\n            that a total of US$4,545,350.19 from these four expenditure\n            categories could be reallocated to two other expenditure\n            categories. The increase for expenditure in the category of\n            goods and associated services amounts to US$3,535,350.10 is\n            also a reason of reallocation. Costs for services and goods\n            especially for equipping and furnishing health care\n            facilities have increased significantly since project\n            preparation was finalized in December 2005."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Maternal and Infant\n            Health and Nutrition Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/02/13807697/guatemala-maternal-infant-health-nutrition-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"GT-Guatemala Maternal And Infant Health And\n            Nutrition -- P077756","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Disease Control & Prevention,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Guatemala","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20110221021407"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Child Health, child health services,\n            communities, expenditures, Food Security, Health Care,\n            Health Care Centers, health care facilities, health centers,\n            health facilities, Health Services, INFANT HEALTH, Infant\n            Health Care, intervention, Maternal and Child Health,\n            NUTRITION, Primary Care"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF051359-PHRD-GUATEMALA: BASIC HEALTH\n            FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS,TF095871-Guatemala: Scaling Up Nutrition","repnb":"59596"},"facets":{}}}
