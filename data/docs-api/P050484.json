Some lessons learned\n            included: in this first venture into the secondary education\n            subsector, goals for change in content and processes should\n            have been much more modest. Project teams and sector\n            management need to resist the temptation to try to fix all\n            problems in a single operation, particularly, in a first\n            operation in a subsector. The errors and inconsistencies in\n            presentation of the project development objective (PDO) and\n            the gaps in performance indicators obscured the links\n            between interventions and objectives in the SEEP, and\n            hindered project implementation. Statements of a\n            project's development objective should be clear,\n            logical, and consistent, ideally, repeated verbatim across\n            project documentation and throughout the course of project\n            implementation. Key performance indicators should reflect\n            all of the main elements of the PDO. The 2010 project\n            restructuring was seriously late in reflecting changing\n            implementation circumstances. Even then it did not address\n            disconnect between the new activity, upgrading general\n            secondary schools, and the project description and PDO\n            instruments. The restructuring was also directed to senior\n            management, without a documented consideration of whether\n            circumstances may have warranted Board approval. In order to\n            be the constructive tool that it is meant to be, project\n            restructuring needs to be timely and appropriately directed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Secondary

The extension is necessary\n            to complete the rehabilitation of additional 67 schools\n            during the summer so they can meet minimum quality\n            requirements for accreditation and thus help achieve the\n            project's quality of education objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Secondary Education Enhancement\n            Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Secondary Education\n            Enhancement Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16518630/egypt-secondary-education-enhancement-project-restructuring","projn":"EG-Secondary Education Enhancement Project\n            -- P050484","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access & Equity in Basic Education,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Education For All","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120719003905"},"theme":"Education for all,Participation and civic engagement,Other social development,Education for the knowledge economy","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Sub-national government administration,Secondary education,Other social services","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accreditation, curricula, education system,\n            equitable education, general secondary education, higher\n            education, professional development, quality of education,\n            rehabilitation process, School Buildings, schools, Secondary\n            Education, teacher, teacher training, teachers"}},"owner":"Education (MNSHE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"71281"},"16232162":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/04/16232162/egypt-secondary-education-enhancement-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/04/16232162/egypt-secondary-education-enhancement-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","new_url":"2012/04/16232162/egypt-secondary-education-enhancement-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","disclosure_date":"2012-04-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-04-18T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-04-18T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/04/19/000333038_20120419001203/Rendered/INDEX/550670PJPR0v200ructuring0Data0sheet.doc.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/04/19/000333038_20120419001203/Rendered/PDF/550670PJPR0v200ructuring0Data0sheet.doc.pdf","credit_no":"3194","docdt":"2012-04-17T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Secondary Education Enhancement\n            Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Secondary Education\n            Enhancement Project for Egypt is to improve the quality and\n            opportunity in secondary education.
