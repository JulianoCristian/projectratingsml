Among the\n            lessons learned, it is reinforced that strong country\n            ownership is essential to support reforms. As it so\n            happened, the political environment in the country was\n            fragile, and increasingly uncertain, which hampered reforms,\n            and eroded new concepts, originally established for primary\n            health care. In fact, the absence of a health sector policy\n            (though widely discussed, debated, and accepted at the\n            republican, and oblast (local) levels early on), had adverse\n            effects on the development of family medicine care. The\n            nature of health sector reforms, as supported by this\n            project, is inherently political, and its success depends on\n            the careful integration of the political dimensions of\n            reform with health technical aspects. Thus, identification\n            of project risks, based on assessment of the political\n            environment for reform - through a political mapping\n            exercise and social assessment - is needed, and the Bank\n            should identify risks, and focus on a proactive risk\n            management approach, leveraging the Bank's resources.\n            Additionally, an important element for project success, is\n            to maintain close coordination with donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Health Reform Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan - Health Reform\n            Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1982684/kazakhstan-health-reform-program-project","projn":"KZ-Health Restructuring Project -- P046499","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Kazakhstan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02082404015644"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"alcohol,basic\n            services,capitation,cardiovascular diseases,clinical\n            outcomes,communities,Disease\n            Control,doctors,Education,expenditures,financial\n            management,general practice,General\n            Practitioners,Health,health centers,health facilities,health\n            policy,health promotion,Health Reform,Health reforms,health\n            sector,health services,health system,hospital\n            beds,hospitals,laboratory\n            equipment,laws,managers,media,medical equipment,medical\n            supplies,mortality,partnership,patient care,performance\n            indicators,physicians,primary care,Primary Health\n            Care,rehabilitation,schools,supervision,Sustainability,urban areas"},"1":{"cdata!":"alcohol,basic\n            services,capitation,cardiovascular diseases,clinical\n            outcomes,communities,Disease\n            Control,doctors,Education,expenditures,financial\n            management,general practice,General\n            Practitioners,Health,health centers,health facilities,health\n            policy,health promotion,Health Reform,Health reforms,health\n            sector,health services,health system,hospital\n            beds,hospitals,laboratory\n            equipment,laws,managers,media,medical equipment,medical\n            supplies,mortality,partnership,patient care,performance\n            indicators,physicians,primary care,Primary Health\n            Care,rehabilitation,schools,supervision,Sustainability,urban areas"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"4":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"trustfund":"TF038774-ARMENIA - SUPERVISION OF\n            PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROJECTS,TF037455-AFRICA REGION - CBEM - EIS,TF036937-SENEGAL - CAPACITY BUILDING FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF036722-KAZAKHSTAN - HEALTH PROJECT,TF036721-KAZAKHSTAN - HEALTH PROJECT,TF036691-SENEGAL - COASTAL\n            MANAGEMENT(ENV.
