Lessons reinforce the\n            importance of strong political commitment regarding\n            emergency operations, particularly at the highest level to\n            ensure success. Under this operation, the establishment of\n            an inter-ministerial committee contributed to expedite\n            timely counterpart funding, conducive in turn to a timely\n            project implementation, but most importantly, given the\n            multi-sector nature of the project, support from the\n            Ministry of Planning, a non-line ministry, helped infuse\n            neutrality in expediting project decisions. Moreover, the\n            project criteria of supporting affected areas, provided a\n            receptive community would be willing to participate, and\n            contribute in kind to reconstruction works, was a key factor\n            to success, providing selectivity in the context of natural\n            disasters. However, the nature of emergency projects (and in\n            this case, aggravated by its multi-sectoral components),\n            posed difficult coordination problems, and, in view of the\n            fact that parallel financing is usually outside the control\n            of the International Development Association (IDA), such\n            projects should be firmed-up and, if possible, brought under\n            IDA's management, to prevent coordination and financing delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen -
