Regardless of success,\n            some lessons underline the following. The lack of a robust\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system, and its\n            dependent baseline data, deprive otherwise good projects, of\n            the possibility of being systematically reviewed, and its\n            performance judged accordingly. The Bank's experience\n            should be used to create such an M&E system,\n            particularly in the case of legal reform projects. In\n            addition, the establishment of Legal Advisory Groups with a\n            broad range of institutional representation, proved\n            important for targeted uses of grant resources, based on the\n            country's legislative agenda. However, the\n            establishment of a Training Advisory Group would have\n            benefited training in the efforts for sharing useful\n            experiences, develop reformed law curricula and teaching\n            methodologies, as well as from international\n            consultants' experiences. This leads to the issue of\n            Bank staff managing legal reform projects, who require\n            access to a comprehensive database of experts across legal\n            disciplines, upon which they can rely for help and advice.\n            This is a structural problem in the Bank's system which\n            needs to be addressed for the Bank to offer first rate\n            international experience on complex legal reform activities.\n            Finally, it is suggested that Projects building\n            institutional capacity, and utilizing existing government\n            structures for implementation, have a greater chance of\n            success, as opposed to projects that rely on independent\n            stand-alone implementation units."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Economic Law Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Economic Law Reform
