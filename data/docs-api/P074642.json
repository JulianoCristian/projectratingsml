Ratings for the\n            First, Second, Third Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery\n            Credit Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Fourth Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit Grant\n            Project were as follows:  outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            and the Bank and the Borrower performance were satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included:  overall, the ERR operations\n            were effective in providing critical budget support to\n            Government of Sierra Leone (GOSL) during the initial\n            post-conflict years. The effectiveness was greater in\n            directly supporting the demobilization effort under the DDR\n            program, achieving the initial protective, social, and\n            economic security advances, and in accomplishing process\n            improvements, than in achieving better governance, improved\n            allocation of budget resources and development results in\n            the longer run. Early start of Bank interventions and\n            informed risk taking can help consolidate the peace process.\n            Delayed adoption of a country strategy and programmatic\n            budget support weakens ownership, creates funding\n            uncertainty, and hampers capacity building under the\n            circumstances. Stronger signaling of longer-term resource\n            availability for budget support and capacity-building\n            substitutes for the lack of formal programmatic framework.\n            While project or program designs were kept simple and\n            realistic, more could have been done to develop an\n            appropriate results framework calibrated to post-conflict\n            country circumstances. The Bank is (often) expected to\n            assume a leading role in mobilizing and coordinating\n            external donor assistance in post-conflict situations, and\n            is not always adequately resourced to do this. In\n            recognition of this, post-conflict Bank programs may benefit\n            from senior management support that would enable country\n            teams to more appropriately structure

The lessons learned indicate that the\n            catalytic role of the Credit enhanced the benefits of donor\n            coordination. In particular, the Government was able to make\n            good progress in economic and sectoral performance without\n            reducing the effectiveness of its efforts in demobilization,\n            resettlement and reintegration because of the well\n            coordinated and effective participation of the donor\n            community in post-conflict activities and in institutional\n            development. Task forces can be used effectively to develop\n            narrowly focused tasks such as, in the case of this Credit,\n            policy frameworks and implementation roadmaps. A\n            particularly good example was the task force set up to\n            develop a plan for micro-finance services, that included not\n            only an implementation roadmap but also provided for study\n            tours and formal training programs for local staff to run\n            the program once installed. Similarly, the creation of the\n            National Commission for Privatization appears to have been a\n            useful move. It should be recognized, however, that\n            privatization is often a complex and time-consuming process.\n            In this light, the implementation schedule could have\n            capitalized more on the phased nature of the reform program.\n            The Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC II)\n            might have focused more on ensuring adequate funding for the\n            National Commission for Privatization (NCP), more time to\n            build capacity within the new NCP, and more time to build\n            capacity within the sectoral ministries that would need to\n            establish new regulatory capacities. Process indicators and\n            performance or output indicators should be carefully and\n            realistically set, with sufficient specificity to measure\n            progress and assess achievement while allowing room for flexibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Second Economic\n            Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra
