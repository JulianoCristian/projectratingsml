Lessons convey that the\n            Bank could have taken a more realistic approach regarding\n            the level of adjustment Moldova was being forced to make in\n            restoring economic growth, by addressing longer-term, and\n            deeper-structural adjustments in the definition of project\n            objectives. Hence, the agreed measures led to significant\n            reduction of program effectiveness, conducive to extended\n            implementation delays. Instead, front-loading conditionality\n            prior to Board presentation, or the use of single tranche\n            operations, could have been useful tools under circumstances\n            of intense resource constraints, as is the case of Moldova.\n            Furthermore, the inability to coordinate foreign assistance,\n            should be guided by the Bank's assistance in donor\n            coordination. Regardless of success, the privatization\n            program as a whole, was not sufficiently deep, neither was\n            the agricultural privatization - which seemingly, only\n            provided a means of subsistence to the rural population.\n            Therefore it is worth considering the privatization process\n            early on, focused on post-privatization market development\n            for agriculture, and, on the need for strong political will\n            regarding industrial privatization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Second Structural Adjustment\n

support the\n            Government's reforms necessary to create conditions for\n            a resumption of growth and improvement in living conditions\n            in Moldova. To achieve this objective, critical reforms need\n            to be undertaken in: i) improving financial discipline; ii)\n            privatizing the energy sector; iii) accelerating land reform\n            and privatization; iv) reforming the pension system; and v)\n            completing enterprise privatization, specially for\n            small-scale enterprises. SAL II will have three fundamental\n            benefits. First, the reform program supported by the SAL II\n            will address key bottlenecks, and enhance the prospects of\n            long-term growth and improved living standards by setting in\n            place a comprehensive program of reforms that will span the\n            1998 Parliamentary elections. Second, it will provide\n            short-term budgetary support essential for maintaining the\n            level of basic public services. The availability of low\n            cost, non-inflationary budgetary financing will help\n            consolidate Moldova's economic stabilization. Third, it\n            will provide necessary foreign exchange to purchase imports\n            critical for Moldova's economic activity while\n            maintaining creditworthiness. Finally, measures supported by\n            SAL II --payments discipline and completion of privatization\n            and land reform-- are necessary conditions for sustainable\n            growth and
