Project performance was\n            poor in a number of areas. Implementation was untimely and\n            extended almost twice as long as projected at appraisal.\n            This was really a pilot project to a country which had done\n            very little, until the time of the credit, to support\n            indigenous entrepreneurs. While the line of credit and\n            technical assistance provided under the project helped\n            develop indigenous private sector enterprise in Liberia, the\n            project fell short of expectations in several areas. Overall\n            performance of the Borrower was poor. The following\n            conclusions and lessons can be drawn from the project's\n            experiences; (a) The credit was granted at a time when the\n            Liberian institutions were not ready to operate a relatively\n            complex SME financing scheme; (b) Given the scarcity of\n            skilled human resources in countries like Liberia and to\n            avoid duplication, Bank technical assistance should be\n            integrated with ongoing technical assistance programs funded\n            by other donors whenever possible; (c) While suspension of\n            Bank Group disbursements for non-payment of earlier loans\n            and credits is necessary, it has a serious impact on ongoing\n            projects and adds to implementation difficulties and adverse performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprise Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - Small- and Medium-Scale\n            Enterprise
