The\n            project achieved most of its objectives, institutional\n            development was negligible, sustainability is likely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, adjustment operations extending over a three\n            year period with an emphasis on macroeconomic stabilization\n            may be of limited effectiveness for institutional reform\n            given the short time frame in which they are generally set.\n            Second, even at the micro level, well-articulated reform\n            strategies should precede plans and their implementation.\n            Third, more attention needs to be given to both achieving\n            and maintaining a broad consensus on the reform program,\n            especially in a new democratic environment. Finally,\n            firmness on the part of donors when a program has gone off\n            track can contribute to the emergence of a better basis for\n            program implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -
