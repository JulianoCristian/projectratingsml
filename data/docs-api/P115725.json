No\n            significant changes or revisions were made to the project.\n            Some lessons learned include the knowledge that significant\n            delays occur with fund distribution due to the time required\n            to formalize GoI and donor agreements, also, that capacity\n            building and reaching agreement with various levels of\n            government is time-consuming and impacted by delayed fund\n            release into provincial DIPAs.  Additional lessons learned\n            were that training methodology needs to cater for diverse\n            participant needs and provide opportunities for activities\n            and participant discussions that address practical\n            challenges in BOS management faced by schools and that the\n            role and responsibilities of local governments with regard\n            to financing and managing the BOS program are expected to\n            increase indicating the need for structured training at\n            District and possibly Sub- District levels. Also learned was\n            the empowerment of parents, the community and the oversight\n            of the SC emphasizes the need to build Principal/Head\n            Teacher leadership and management capacity to respond\n            effectively to the financial, political and interpersonal\n            challenges of BOS."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - BOS-KITA Capacity Development\n            and Campaign Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - BOS-KITA Capacity\n            Development and Campaign Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/12/13781355/indonesia-bos-kita-capacity-development-campaign-project","projn":"ID-Education Tf Support Program Bos-Kita -- P115725","subtopic":"Education For All,Tertiary Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Education","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000370910_20110215095614"},"subsc":"Public administration- Education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to computers, access to education,\n            access to junior secondary education, access to quality\n            education, achievement rates, active learning, adult\n            learning, Basic Education, Basic Education Program, Basic\n            schools, beneficiary schools, block grants, classrooms,\n            Community Orientation, community participation, compulsory\n            education, computer literacy, cost of education,\n            Decentralization, District Education, donor support, dropout\n            rates, Education Capacity, Education Development, Education\n            for all, Education initiatives, Education Offices, education\n            officials, Education Quality, Education Sector, education\n            standards, education system, Educational Achievement,\n            educational guidance, Educational Management, enrolment\n            data, enrolment rate, ethics, expenditures, Free Basic\n            Education, Head Teacher, head teachers, headmasters, Human\n            Development, Information Technology, Intermediate School,\n            interventions, Junior Secondary, junior secondary level,\n            junior secondary levels, Junior Secondary School, junior\n            secondary school level, knowledge development, leadership,\n            Learning, Learning Communities, learning process, level of\n            education, manuals, Mathematics, National Education,\n            national education standards, NER, Net Enrolment, Net\n            Enrolment Rates, papers, parental involvement, participation\n            rates, Performance Indicators, Primary Education, primary\n            level, Primary Net Enrolment, Primary School, primary\n            schools, Primary Teachers, Principals, printing,\n            professional development, Provincial Education, Quality\n            Assurance, radio, Reading, Regional Education, regular\n            supervision, remote schools, repetition, repetition rates,\n            Research Institute, resource centers, rural areas, School\n            Activity, school budgets, School Committee, school\n            committees, school data, school fees, School Improvement,\n            School Improvement Plan, school level, School levels, School\n            Management, School Management Team, school performance,\n            School Supervisor, School Supervisors, School Year, Schools,\n            Science Study, Secondary Education, secondary schools, Self\n            Evaluation, senior teachers, skills requirements, small\n            schools, Social Development, socialization, Student\n            Assessment, student learning, student learning achievement,\n            student performance, supervision of schools, supplementary\n            resources, Teacher, teachers, technical assistance, training\n            activities, training centers, training costs, training\n            materials, training needs, training programs, training \u00ad\n            funds, tuition, tuition fee, tutors, universal primary enrolment"}},"owner":"Education Sector Unit (EASHE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF093613-DUTCH EDUCATION SUPPORT PROGRAM\n            - BOS-KITA (RE)","repnb":"ICR1547"},"facets":{}}}
