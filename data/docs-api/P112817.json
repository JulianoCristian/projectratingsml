Support\n            Credit and Grant Program (PRSC-2) for Lesotho is the second\n            in a series of three annual development policy operations\n            (DPO), envisaged in the FY 2006-09 Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS). The operation will support the Government of\n            Lesotho's development program that underpins its\n            Interim National Development Framework (INDF) and the growth\n            strategy. The operation amount is US$25 million equivalent.\n            The operation comes at a time when the Government of Lesotho\n            has to cope with the adverse impact of the global recession\n            while retaining focus on longer-term reforms to achieve\n            faster growth, address the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to tackle\n            significant human development challenges in health and\n            education, and to improve public financial management. The\n            amount includes US$10 million equivalent from the Crisis\n            Response Window (CRW), of which US$5 million equivalent is a\n            grant. The Government of Lesotho (GOL) is seeking the\n            support of its development partners as it responds to\n            cushion the decline in aggregate demand and shelter the\n            vulnerable segments of the population. The PRSC-2 will\n            support and help protect the Government's long term\n            reform program, essential for the country's sustained\n            development, as it seeks to mitigate the impact of the\n            economic crisis while facing a shrinking resource base. The\n            fiscal space, analytical support, and policy dialogue that\n            will go with the operation will help guide the\n            Government's focus on key reform areas. It will also\n            play a catalytic role to furthering the policy dialogue on\n            major reform areas such as public financial management,\n            education, and health."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Second Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit and Grant Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho - Second Poverty\n            Reduction
