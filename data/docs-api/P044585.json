Additionally,\n            rehabilitation works will also include sanitation services;\n            2) improve teacher training curricula, upgrade\n            qualifications of training staff, and expand the capacity of\n            the Personnel Training Center for National Education\n            (CEPEN), to provide improved training to primary school\n            teachers.

During\n            rehabilitation, and expansion of schools, it is expected\n            that unsuitable materials will pose environmental, and\n            health risks.
