The overall disappointing\n            performance mainly reflects over-ambitious objectives for\n            such a short implementation period, and a government change\n            at the outset, which exposed incomplete commitment to the\n            project strategy, exacerbating design, and preparation\n            shortfalls. The experience of this project confirms a number\n            of lessons: 1) in responding to emergencies, assistance in a\n            conventional project format should be limited to the\n            immediate emergency, while a series of Adjustable Program\n            Loans, may be a better instrument for longer term needs; 2)\n            a thorough political risk analysis, and ensured broad\n            political support - e.g., privatization, and utility tariff\n            modification - is essential whenever government, or policy\n            changes could occur; 3) contract management should consider,\n            and avoid potential conflicts of interest, by excluding\n            contractors who bid on the preparation of privatization\n            arrangements from bidding on supply, and construction\n            contracts, or the privatization itself; and, carefully\n            foster incentives and/or penalties in management contracts,\n            to ensure proper contractor performance; and, 4) greater\n            consistency is needed in project documents, so as to improve\n            understanding, and agreement in the statement of objectives,\n            and project description."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Trinidad-Tobago - Water Sector Institutional\n            Strengthening Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Trinidad-Tobago - Water Sector\n

and,\n            uncertain for the medium term. The Bank performance was\n            inadequate in the design for private participation\n            inclusion, was not appropriate on decisions regarding issues\n            on performance indicators, and, supervision was deficient on\n            several fronts, namely, lack of financial covenants'\n            monitoring, weakness towards achieving appraisal indicators,\n            and, lack of substantive auditing action. Likewise, the\n            Borrower's performance was mostly unsatisfactory,\n            accounting for both implementation, and counterpart funding\n            delays. Lessons indicate that private participation in\n            infrastructure would better succeed under an open process\n            design, with an approach towards public sharing of\n            contracts, preventing governmental mistrust, offering\n            instead a participatory strategy, i.e., broader dialogue,\n            ownership, and transparency. Management contracts should\n            encompass a framework for incentives, to prevent negative\n            monitoring impacts, in the absence of performance\n            indicators. Furthermore, contracts need to be comprehensive,\n            and self-contained, allowing the management contractor full\n            autonomy, and the resources to meet the performance\n            indicators. Consequently, governments need to accept full\n            responsibility for the development of performance\n            indicators, and the underlying data."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Trinidad and Tobago
