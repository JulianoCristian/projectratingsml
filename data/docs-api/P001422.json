The Bank's supervision was, on the whole,\n            properly timed. However, the project could have benefited if\n            more time was spent by the architect on project sites. The\n            delays in the implementation of the fellowship program might\n            have been avoided, or at least minimized, if the Bank had\n            insisted that the Government secure the services of an\n            experienced agency to assist it in placing candidates in\n            overseas institutions. This was eventually done later (1980)\n            during project implementation when the Government signed a\n            contract with an American university to administer the\n            fellowship program. Maintenance of the vehicles procured\n            under the project could perhaps also have been improved if\n            the Bank had taken measures to assist in introducing at\n            least a basic vehicle maintenance training scheme. An\n            important lesson for the Bank is that in the future,\n            adequate provision should be made for financing local costs\n            for vehicle maintenance and spare parts before financing a\n            large number of vehicles in countries which have unusually\n            bad roads, poor system of vehicle maintenance and limited\n            recurrent financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Second Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - Second Education
