Rural Alliances Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Rural Alliances Project for Bolivia\n            received a satisfactory outcome rating with low or\n            negligible risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and\n            the Borrower received satisfactory performances as well.\n            There were two restructurings that took place during this\n            project. The first restructuring involved changing of a\n            Ministry name and new dates for covenants. The second\n            restructuring added financing for project scale up, revised\n            part of the PDO and extended the closing date of the\n            project. There were a number of lessons learned from this\n            project and they are as follows: (1) Beneficiary targeting\n            should take into consideration endowments and opportunities.\n            Not all small producers have the capacity or risk profile\n            required for entering into market-driven partnerships. (2)\n            The importance of using self-selection instruments\n            transparently. (3) Linking social accountability and formal\n            controls has multiple benefits. Formal accountability\n            mechanisms and documentation requirements can be\n            significantly strengthened and simplified by the use of and\n            reliance on social accountability mechanisms within the\n            beneficiary organizations. (4) Successful producer\n            associations require new support instruments. To encourage\n            the further growth of the producer organizations after\n            alliance financing ends, a new line of financing should be\n            available to producers so as to graduate them from donor\n            support and to facilitate their access to credit. (5)\n            Initial buyer assessments ensure continuity. Some producer\n            organizations found that their increased productive capacity\n            (including that to innovate) surpassed their current buyer\u0092s\n            capacity. (6) Women\u0092s participation requires differentiated\n            support. Thirty two percent of the producers in alliances\n            were women but their representation at the producer\n            organization directorate levels remains low. (7) Transparent\n            and competitive staff selection procedures and performance\n            evaluations were a key element of project implementation\n            success. (8) External viability assessment of alliances\n            improved quality of alliance plans, provided an independent\n            confirmation of feasibility and a benchmark for project ex\n            ante evaluation, and permitted adequate tailoring of\n            producer organization subprojects to local context and\n            alliance objectives. (9) Producer organization capacity\n            building needs to take into account business needs. (10) Use\n            of country public financial management systems increases\n            transparency and efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Rural Alliances
