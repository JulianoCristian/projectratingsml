There were numerous lessons learned on\n            this project. On project design and the grant instrument:\n            providing flexibility during implementation to adjust design\n            to emerging realities within broad objectives allows\n            opportunities for maximizing project impact. On the\n            endowment and institutional arrangements: public private\n            partnerships can provide an effective, mutually beneficial\n            vehicle that capitalizes on the best that each of the\n            partners have to provide. On impacts/outcomes: it is\n            possible to measure habitat transformation, but results will\n            likely only be measurable if measured annually, over time.\n            More work needs to be done on establishing strategies for\n            measuring species populations. On Protected Area (PA)\n            management with social responsibility: Protected Area\n            Councils are an important tool for developing the culture of\n            conservation and for stakeholder participation. On\n            sustainable activities and community relations in PAs:\n            projects are most successful when: a) they require\n            counterpart funding from the implementing organization; b)\n            focus on critical management issues; c) well functioning\n            projects are extended over a number of years; and d) there\n            is strong interaction between the PA management team and the\n            implementing organization. On monitoring of biodiversity and\n            habitat loss indicators: species population surveys need to\n            be more closely organized with PA Directors to help improve\n            their relevance for PA management strategies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

Project\n            development objectives are: 1) to conserve globally\n            important biodiversity in selected areas of SINAP; 2) to\n            promote the economic, social and environmental\n            sustainability of productive activities in selected\n            protected areas; 3) to promote social co-responsibility for\n            conservation; 4) and to promote the inclusion of\n            biodiversity conservation and sustainable use criteria in\n            development projects.
