The FSAL policy conditionality was based on the\n            findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)\n            and further technical analysis conducted during preparation.\n            The high quality of the technical analysis was crucial to\n            engage the authorities' commitment to the reform agenda\n            during preparation of this operation. High quality technical\n            analysis and advice was also carried out during\n            supervisions. This continued technical and policy dialogue\n            with the authorities and their technical teams was important\n            to maintain the authorities' ownership and commitment\n            to the FSAL development objectives during the course of two\n            administrations. The existence of a well funded Bank\n            Capitalization Fund to support bank restructuring can be an\n            effective stabilizing factor for the financial system,\n            independently of its actual utilization. A condition for\n            third tranche disbursement was the use of Bank\n            Capitalization Fund (FFCB) funds to support bank resolution\n            transactions. The third tranche was disbursed with a waiver\n            of this condition because by the time of tranche\n            disbursement, in December 2006, the FFCB had not been used\n            to support bank resolutions. The FFCB did support bank\n            resolutions after tranche disbursement. It could be argued\n            that in future operations that support this type of funds,\n            the conditionality should be that they are fully operational\n            and not that the funds have been actually used in bank\n            resolutions. Also, the fund should be able to lend to the\n            deposit insurance fund because both funds have complementary\n            roles in bank resolution processes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala -

The Bank loan supports\n            actions to: (1) reform the legal framework for the conduct\n            of monetary and financial policy; (2) reform the financial\n            sector legal framework aimed at strengthening the regulation\n            of financial groups, creating an orderly market exit\n            mechanism, and enhancing credit risk management; (3)\n            strengthen the legal framework for bank supervision,\n            including consolidated supervision of financial groups; (4)\n            enact legislation to prevent money laundering to reduce\n            illegal activities; and (5) consolidate the banking system\n            through the restructuring or closure of insolvent banks,\n            mergers, and acquisitions.
