Some lessons learned included:\n            design of an HIV/AIDS intervention in a post-conflict\n            setting should be greatly simplified to accommodate capacity\n            and institutional constraints that often exist in such\n            settings. For instance, constraints in terms of geographic\n            coverage or transportation links in a post-conflict setting\n            are common and can significantly impede implementation and\n            scope of activities. Consideration should be given to\n            phasing of community response and engagement in settings\n            with limited in-country capacity. Insufficient data at\n            project design can significantly hamper targeting of\n            high-risk groups and the need to improve sentinel\n            surveillance among most at risk populations cannot be\n            overstated. Bank responsiveness (or lack thereof) to\n            implementation challenges has direct consequences on\n            development outcomes. The responsiveness of Bank management\n            and Government to project management challenges can have\n            deleterious effects on project outcomes if not dealt with\n            appropriately and in a timely fashion. High level political\n            commitment provides a good platform for ensuring public\n            attention. The active and vocal support from the President,\n            parliamentarians, and other political officers helped to\n            raise the visibility and attention given to HIV/AIDS issues\n            in the public domain. Contracting a financial and\n            procurement management agent helps to mitigate the financial\n            risk exposure of HIV/AIDS projects not only at the national\n            but also decentralized and community levels, where\n            governance and accountability mechanisms are not well\n            developed and understood."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - HIV/AIDS

management plan made to counter\n            anticipated negative environmental impacts. Appropriate\n            design, sites and operation of sanitary landfills, leachate\n            treatment and control, and water quality testing will reduce\n            the risk of drinking water contamination. High temperature\n            incineration, installation of flue gas cleaning devices, air\n            quality testing, and non-incineration of materials\n            containing chlorine or heavy metals will prevent release of\n            pollutants into the air. Provision and ensuring the routine\n            use of protective clothing, staff training, and teaching\n            first aid will reduce the occurrence of occupational\n            hazards. Limiting access to disposal sites, fencing of\n            disposal sites, separating cells for medical wastes, and\n            sensitizing the public through the media, particularly\n            radio, television, posters, leaflets, newspapers, etc., will\n            minimize disease transmission. Furthermore, all health care\n            facilities will be equipped with appropriate equipment,\n            materials, and facilities for collecting, managing, and\n            transporting medical waste.
