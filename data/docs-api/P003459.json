This project has been aiming to expand\n            railway capacity since the 1980s, in order to sustain\n            economic development. It also aimed to improve operational\n            efficiency and develop the Ministry of Railways (MOR)'s\n            technical and managerial capabilities. In sum, the\n            project's outcome is rated as satisfactory, its\n            institutional development as negligible and its\n            sustainability as likely. The main lessons learned from the\n            project are as follows: a) Difficulties were encountered\n            during appraisal in obtaining agreements about the need for\n            and scope of technical assistance for maintenance\n            activities. This should have alerted the Bank that the\n            Borrower had minimal commitment in this area; b) The project\n            was not adequately supervised especially in the first four\n            years when supervision was most needed; c) The workload\n            related to procurement was heavy. In future projects, the\n            Bank and MOR should try to increase administrative\n            efficiency by agreeing on fewer but larger contracts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Third Railway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
