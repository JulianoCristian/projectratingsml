The objectives of the project were\n            to: (a) reduce transport costs of passengers and goods, in\n            particular for food products, by restoring the most\n            important major trunk roads in northwestern parts of\n            Bangladesh to maintainable condition; (b) introduce\n            institutional and technical improvements in the programming\n            of works, the administration and maintenance of the road\n            system and in technical standards and materials; and (c)\n            upgrade the capabilities of the local contracting industry\n            to undertake larger road works as an alternative to\n            inefficient and very small size contracts. The project was\n            successful in achieving its principal objectives. The key\n            lessons learned from the project are as follows: 1) An\n            efficient and effective maintenance management system needs\n            to be in place to ensure sustainability of road\n            improvements; 2) To ensure the integrity of road networks,\n            the issue of vehicle overloading and axle load control is an\n            issue of major concern. This needs coordinated efforts from\n            all concerned agencies in both the public and private\n            sectors; 3) With roads improved under the project, the speed\n            of the vehicles has increased and so correspondingly has the\n            number and severity of road accidents and fatalities on some\n            inter urban sections of the project roads due to lack of\n            enforcement; 4) There is also a need to streamline the\n            procurement processing of GOB for the award of both\n            consultancy and construction contracts, which on many\n            occasions has caused long delays in awarding of the\n            contracts; 5) Supply of bitumen from the Government\n            refineries was often inadequate; 6) The cumbersome\n            bureaucratic procedures for custom clearance to import\n            materials and construction equipment into the country cause\n            tremendous delays and heavy losses for both the local and\n            foreign construction companies based in Bangladesh; and 7)\n            To ensure full benefits of the training sub-component under\n            the institutional development components, it is important to\n            develop a comprehensive training program in close\n            consultation with the borrowers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Road Rehabilitation and\n
