Some lessons learned\n            included: the Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA)\n            studies conducted in Benin and other studies have confirmed\n            the positive impact of Projet Multisectoriel de Lutte contre\n            le VIH/SIDA (PPLS) in Benin. An important lesson here is\n            that persons infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS can be\n            reached through community mobilization and the use of\n            multiple channels. The process is demanding, as hundreds of\n            civil society organizations must be involved and trained,\n            and thousands of community-based groups established, and\n            nearly all government administrative infrastructures\n            engaged, but it can be done with good planning and\n            management and through innovative approaches. It is widely\n            accepted that Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) are\n            valuable tools of coordination and management in HIVIAIDS\n            activities. However, building up a nationwide and uniform\n            M&E system is much more demanding than project planners\n            usually acknowledge during the design process. It requires\n            much manpower (specialists and consultants), substantial\n            funds, and years of time. To ensure that everyone accepts a\n            uniform system, it helps to establish a steering committee\n            drawn from stakeholders including donor agencies; to\n            persuade some agencies to finance part of the process of\n            developing the M&E system; and to appoint United Nations\n            AIDS Program (UNAIDS) to chair the committee."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin -

In accordance with the main\n            goal of the MAP, the development objectives of the project\n            are to contribute to curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic\n            in Benin and to mitigating its impact for all those who are\n            infected or affected through 1) accelerating, intensifying,\n            diversifying, and empowering the response to civil society\n            and the public sector to the HIV/AIDS epidemic; and 2)\n            building capacity in both civil society and the public\n            sector to achieve and sustain this scaled-up response. The\n            project has three components: The first supports the\n            response of civil society by strengthening the institutional\n            capacities of community-based organizations and civil\n            society organizations, carrying out awareness campaigns,\n            training, and community sub-project preparation. It also\n            provides commuunity grants for executing sub-projects, and\n            financial support to civil service organizations for\n            executing prevention and care activities for communities.\n            The second component finances the response of the public\n            sector by supporting non-health sector action plans, or\n            health sector intervention/activities. The third component\n            supports project coordination, management and monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Multi-Sectoral HIV/AIDS
