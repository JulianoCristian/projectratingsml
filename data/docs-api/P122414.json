Some lessons learned included:\n            however, the evaluation criteria used to assess Bank\n            projects are not particularly suited to taking this kind of\n            risk. In effect, when implementation is negatively affected\n            by unrest related to the perceived legitimacy of the\n            Government, the criteria will lead necessarily to a\n            downgrading of performance. To avoid such an outcome, the\n            Bank would need to remain disengaged from countries where\n            this risk was thought to be relatively high. Such a stance,\n            however, would not be consistent with the Bank's\n            mission of poverty reduction and arguably could make social\n            unrest more likely. On balance, Bank engagement in fragile\n            states like Yemen carries high risks and potentially high\n            rewards. What is needed is not disengagement but more\n            transparency with respect to these contexts. Given the very\n            fragile context against which this operation was\n            implemented, and the single tranche approach, a less\n            ambitious operation would have been more appropriate. While\n            it is difficult ex-ante to judge properly the right scope\n            which typically rivals with the given moment of opportunity,\n            a consistently simpler and more focused approach should be\n            the preferred option in a fragile context such as the one in\n            Yemen. The design of an operation as a single tranche, if\n            embedded with investment operations as was the case here\n            allows the Bank to conduct oversight over the operation\n            after the disbursement of the funds, even if the\n            country's own monitoring and evaluation system is weak.\n            The Bank remains this way engaged with the Government\n            through the full program period. Of course, in this specific\n            case, supervision was compromised by the civil unrest of\n            2011 and by the lack of any physical engagement of the Bank\n            team in Yemen from March 2011 to early 2012. Reversed\n            missions helped to compensate. On the positive side, the\n            design of the operation benefitted from its close links with\n            other World Bank group operations. This enabled the Bank,\n            among other things, to draw on monitoring and evaluation\n            systems already in place in these parallel operations and\n            thereby overcome capacity weaknesses within the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Private Sector Growth and Social\n            Protection Policy Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen -

The\n            Project has four components. Component one comprises of\n            private sector growth and employment which includes\n            streamlining of investment incentives and the simplification\n            of business entry procedures. Component two consists of\n            enhancing financial intermediation and improving access to\n            finance by the effective launch of a credit registry and the\n            completion of the framework for micro finance.
