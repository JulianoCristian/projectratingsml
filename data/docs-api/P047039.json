Ratings for the Judicial Reform Project for\n            Guatemala are as follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to\n            the development outcome was negligible; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            satisfactory. Ratings for the Judicial Conflict Resolution\n            Improvement Project for Colombia are as follows: outcome was\n            unsatisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            significant; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. This Project\n            Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) suggests three broad\n            lessons. The first is that it is important to adapt the\n            objectives and design of the project to local law,\n            conditions, and peculiarities. The second lesson highlights\n            the need for flexibility in overall approach in the\n            conception of the project. In addition, it is essential to\n            solicit local knowledge as well as input from specific\n            beneficiaries in the process of selecting project\n            objectives, design, and implementation arrangements. The\n            third lesson is that it is unwise to rely exclusively on\n            by-products of case management software to generate the data\n            needed for adequate monitoring and evaluation. The key\n            recommendation for initiatives in judicial reform is that\n            more resources should be invested in identifying local\n            experts to give them a leading role in the design,\n            execution, and evaluation of projects. This will facilitate\n            greater adaptation to the specific conditions of each\n            country, and ultimately ensure ownership and sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Judicial Reform Project, Guatemala\n            -

Judicial Reform Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Judicial Reform Project\n            for Guatemala were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory; the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory; and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: Although so\n            obvious as to hardly bear mention, without counterpart\n            buy-in, a judicial or institutional reform effort will not\n            get far. It is the corollary to this statement that is more\n            important, buy-in means not just accepting the donor\n            contributions, but rather internalizing and actively\n            pursuing the change goals behind them. As a corollary to\n            this corollary, it is also important that the Borrower\n            understand and commit to the overall project goals and\n            project development objective (PDO) and component\n            indicators. In one of meetings with the former and current\n            project coordinating unit (PCU) subcoordinators (the\n            official actually in charge of the PCU), the ICR team\n            reviewed the indicators with them and it was evident that\n            there was a lack of clarity on several. Participatory design\n            is good, but can lead to a project 'designed by a\n            committee.' Highly qualified international assistance\n            is also important, especially for countries only starting on\n            the judicial reform route, and thus likely to repeat the\n            errors of the past. If baseline data and other means of\n            tracking performance and project achievements do not exist\n            when a project goes into effect, they need to be created\n            early on. This is critical to establishing concrete\n            performance targets, focusing implementers on achieving\n            them, establishing a monitoring and evaluation system, and\n            allowing the project to demonstrate advances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Judicial Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala - Judicial Reform
