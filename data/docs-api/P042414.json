(SPP/BAJ) are: 1) to improve basic infrastructure and\n            generate income transfers in rural communities - in which\n            education and health services will be reinforced by the\n            other two sister projects - through the use of\n            labor-intensive techniques; 2) to set up a body that will\n            have the permanent capacity to monitor and analyze the\n            socioeconomic standards of living of the population; and 3)\n            to raise public and political awareness of social issues,\n            their relation to economic growth, and the remedial

these conditions; and 3) assistance to a central\n            government body to coordinate the various actions undertaken\n            under the SPP and national social development strategy and\n
