Despite the lack of counterpart funding, which\n            was persistent during implementation, and a poor progress in\n            the decentralization process, the Micro-projects Unit (MPU)\n            managed implementation satisfactorily. The extent to which\n            poor communities can effectively operate was successfully\n            demonstrated, reconfirming the benefits of stakeholder\n            participation and capacity building at local levels. Lessons\n            are addressed specifically for social funds development,\n            showing the need for these funds to build institutional\n            linkages, ensuring coherence and sustainability,\n            particularly at local and community levels, safeguarding\n            local characteristics. Social funds should operate within\n            unified policies and procedures, in comparison with\n            financing agencies, where discrepancies may well hinder an\n            efficient implementation, as well as operational\n            development. In addition, technical support during\n            supervision increases project success, thus quality of\n            infrastructure should be closely monitored. Increasing\n            community ownership and commitment may, to some extent be a\n            viable solution for the sustainability of those social funds\n            affected by recurrent costs. Finally, MPU was responsive to\n            recommendations due to its learning flexibility, thus\n            adapting to the improvement and success of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Social Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - Social Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/01/728102/zambia-social-recovery-project","projn":"ZM-Social Recovery Proj -- P003242","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Teaching and Learning,Community Development and Empowerment,Health Economics & Finance,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Zambia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99032505562219"},"subsc":"Other social services,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Social Protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACHIEVEMENT,achievements,basic\n            infrastructure,Beneficiaries,beneficiary\n            assessments,capacity\n            building,classrooms,communities,community\n            associations,community capacity,community\n            development,community groups,Community Initiatives,community\n            members,community ownership,community\n            participation,corrective\n            steps,decentralization,demonstration,Development\n            Planning,district\n            officials,employment,enrollment,exercises,family\n            planning,field visits,financial policies,Flexibility,health\n            care,health education,health needs,health\n            sector,hygiene,ICR,immunization,IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION\n            REPORT,intervention,interventions,learning,living\n            conditions,local capacity,local communities,local\n            organizations,Managers,medical\n            services,mortality,NGO,nongovernmental\n            organizations,nutrition,participatory approach,policy\n            changes,Poverty Monitoring,poverty reduction,poverty\n            reduction programs,procurement,programs,PROJECT\n            IMPLEMENTATION,PROJECT OBJECTIVES,research\n            capacity,SAP,schools,service delivery,social funds,social\n            indicators,social services,student\n            performance,teacher,teacher associations,teachers,Technical\n            quality,training centers,vandalism"},"1":{"cdata!":"ACHIEVEMENT,achievements,basic\n            infrastructure,Beneficiaries,beneficiary\n            assessments,capacity\n            building,classrooms,communities,community\n            associations,community capacity,community\n            development,community groups,Community Initiatives,community\n            members,community ownership,community\n            participation,corrective\n            steps,decentralization,demonstration,Development\n            Planning,district\n            officials,employment,enrollment,exercises,family\n            planning,field visits,financial policies,Flexibility,health\n            care,health education,health needs,health\n            sector,hygiene,ICR,immunization,IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION\n            REPORT,intervention,interventions,learning,living\n            conditions,local capacity,local communities,local\n            organizations,Managers,medical\n            services,mortality,NGO,nongovernmental\n            organizations,nutrition,participatory approach,policy\n            changes,Poverty Monitoring,poverty reduction,poverty\n            reduction programs,procurement,programs,PROJECT\n            IMPLEMENTATION,PROJECT OBJECTIVES,research\n            capacity,SAP,schools,service delivery,social funds,social\n            indicators,social services,student\n            performance,teacher,teacher associations,teachers,Technical\n            quality,training centers,vandalism"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 1 (AFTH1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
