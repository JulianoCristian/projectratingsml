ministry must be assessed in detail with regard to\n            implementation mechanisms and project management\n            arrangements; (ii) in hindsight it would also have been\n            useful to do an explicit stakeholder analysis; (iii)\n            architectural designs for the clinics should have been\n            agreed during appraisal and confirmed during negotiations;\n
