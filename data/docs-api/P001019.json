The project has achieved its\n            main objectives, its impact has been significant,\n            sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the acceptance of the project was\n            jeopardized by the nature of the sales contract and the way\n            in which inflation was ignored. This should be a lesson for\n            the assessment of other projects in the mining sector.\n            Second, more attention should have been given to the\n            operational aspects at appraisal. The earlier provision of\n            technical assistance to OFAB, clearer definition of its\n            role, and better provision physically and financially for\n            its start up would have created an easier commissioning\n            period for little extra cost and improved the range and\n            impact of secondary benefits as well as facilitated the\n            preparation of future projects. Third, although port\n            capacity appears adequate for the time being, operational\n            conditions are sufficiently different from the original\n            concept to make it worthwhile to rerun the computer model.\n            Lastly, methods of procurement and methodology of appraisal\n            should be studied further."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea -
