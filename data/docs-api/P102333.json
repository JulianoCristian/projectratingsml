Some lessons\n            learned included: focus on instruments and incentives for\n            reforms rather than simply on organizations, programs and\n            projects. Based on the past experience, both Government of\n            Punjab and the Bank agreed that new approaches and\n            instruments will be needed to meet the diverse set of\n            challenges facing the water sector. The past investments in\n            irrigation system rehabilitation no doubt brought benefits\n            of reduced incidences of canal breaches and resolved\n            siltation and erosion problems. However, without\n            institutional changes and adequate Operation and Maintenance\n            (O&M), the system reverted to pre-rehabilitation\n            situation. Strong political championship, government\n            ownership, and commitment are essential for the success and\n            continuity of reform programs. The bank's support to\n            Punjab's Irrigation Sector Reforms Program (ISRP) was\n            designed on the basis of extensive analytical work\n            undertaken by the federal and
