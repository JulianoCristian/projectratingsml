The lessons of this\n            project can be broken down into two categories, i.e. those\n            reflecting: (a) project weaknesses that other projects\n            should aim to avoid to ensure a more effective\n            implementation; and (b) project strengths that could be\n            inspirational for current and future operations. For\n            repeater projects to be effective, (i) sequencing/timing\n            needs to be considered carefully to avoid a situation, as in\n            this project, where the first two years were spent on\n            completing the implementation of the first project rather\n            than starting the second; (ii) teams need to take time to\n            carry out the necessary analysis in order to identify the\n            most effective activities and approaches carried out under\n            the original project; (iii) implementation arrangements\n            should be re-assessed; and (iv) lessons of the parent\n            project should be taken into account. Challenging contexts\n            can be seen as an opportunity to find more creative\n            mechanisms to continue support for critical services to\n            beneficiaries. Rather than exiting the country completely or\n            solely relying on parallel systems with NGOs, the Bank\n            worked with the client to design financing that largely\n            focused on existing regional, district and community level\n            systems to maintain service delivery while ensuring that\n            adequate fiduciary safeguards were designed for the
