Lessons learned\n            from the projects included: comprehensive approaches to\n            development in which provision of small-scale infrastructure\n            is accompanied by capacity-building to develop local\n            institutions and ownership are more successful than\n            infrastructure alone. When existing institutions fail and\n            are unwilling to reform, careful design of new institutions\n            can be a viable solution. The success of this approach is\n            heavily conditioned on in-depth institutional analysis,\n            close attention to the governance structure and the\n            willingness of the Bank to stand firm against vested\n            interests for as long as it takes to be accepted. Even so,\n            government does have a role and its interest must be\n            internalized in the governance and regulatory structures of\n            new organizations: partnership is better than conflict.\n            Small pilot projects to test new institutional approaches\n            can be very successful providing they adopt a learning\n            approach and give thoughtful attention to feedback from\n            continuous monitoring to refine the development model. If\n            improved health outcomes are a project objective then\n            careful design of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to\n            link project interventions to improvements in health incomes\n            is needed. This needs to be done from the outset of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Rural Water Supply and\n

The lessons learned indicate that the project\n            has demonstrated that the demand-driven approach, as an\n            alternative to the traditional supply-driven service\n            delivery, works quite successfully. Making the communities\n            participate fully in the decision-making process and in\n            contributing cash and labor have enabled them to gain a\n            sense of ownership of their infrastructure schemes. The\n            project has also demonstrated to the government that reform\n            is possible, and that it pays to try innovative ways of\n            delivering infrastructure services. The project's\n            experience highlights the need to have effective planning\n            and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, for example, with\n            an efficient Management Information System (MIS) system in\n            place from the beginning of a project. To scale up the\n            demand-driven approach to service delivery, it is important\n            that the implementing entity (such as the Fund Board) does\n            not become dependent on IDA/donor financing. Although the\n            project has enabled the communities to own and operate their\n            infrastructure schemes without any significant assistance\n            from the sector institutions or the local government\n            agencies, the need to ensure follow-up support to\n            communities and NGOs in case of natural calamities, for\n            example, remains crucial. Given the Support\n            Organization's (Sos) high involvement in mobilizing and\n            guiding the communities, it is crucial to pay strong\n            attention to the selection and training of the SOs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal -
