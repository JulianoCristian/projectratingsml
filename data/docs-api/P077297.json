Ratings for\n            the Second Community Works Project for Albania were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was moderate; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: a\n            demand-driven approach may not guarantee that the highest\n            community priorities are met unless steps are taken to\n            ensure a robust and inclusive participatory process and to\n            prevent demand distortion that can result from, for example,\n            requests for goods and services that are perceived to be\n            easiest to obtain (e.g., roads in this case) rather than\n            those that may be most wanted. Capacity building cannot be\n            treated as a by-product; explicit mechanisms will generally\n            be needed to build appropriate and lasting capacity. In\n            projects with multiple objectives requiring different staff\n            skills-mixes for their implementation, up-front clarity\n            about the relative emphasis to be placed on the various\n            objectives is critical, especially in capacity-constrained\n            contexts. Trade-offs among objectives need to be watched\n            closely, and addressed. Building capacity in local\n            governments and communities is time- and human\n            resource-intensive, making disbursements potentially slower\n            and less predictable than when infrastructure delivery is\n            the primary focus. The performance incentives, staffing, and\n            skills-mix of the project implementation unit will need to\n            match the project's primary focus. In the case of\n            Albania, Albanian Development Fund (ADF) maintained an\n            engineering orientation in its staffing and processes,\n            building infrastructure much more successfully than building\n            capacity. In projects with multiple objectives, each of\n            which requires a different staff skill mix for its\n            implementation, up-front clarity about the relative emphasis\n            to be placed on the various objectives is critical. The\n            roles and responsibilities of the various institutions that\n            the project will relate to need to be clarified in project\n            design it, and project design also needs to envision and\n            factor in the longer-term role of any autonomous project\n            implementation unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

Second Community Works Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second Community Works\n            Project (CWP II) for Albania were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: 1) in\n            projects involving the introduction of community\n            participation in investment planning and development\n            decision making, ensure that the level of participation is\n            appropriate to the local context. In the case of Albania,\n            where all planning and development decision making had been\n            controlled by a socialist national government until 1990s,\n            it was important to take a gradual approach in devolving\n            responsibility for investment planning and implementation.\n            This allowed the project to move in the direction of giving\n            greater responsibility to communities and local governments,\n            build ownership for the investments, and thus encourage\n            communities to support operations and maintenance (O&M)\n            and to sustain a culture of civic engagement; 2) community\n            works projects need to emphasize technical quality and\n            operations and maintenance to ensure sustainability of\n            sub-projects. CWP II addressed the need for improved\n            technical quality through requirements for design,\n            procurement, supervision of works, and O&M. The project\n            also provided technical assistance to the implementing\n            agency to ensure adequate attention to technical quality in\n            supervising the works. Measures also were taken to prepare\n            clear Terms of References (TORs) for designers and\n            supervisors, improve technical specifications and design\n            standards, improve documentation, and provide better\n            training; and 3) managing community works projects requires\n            a well-designed M&E system. The experience of CWP II\n            highlights the need to assign attention to developing robust\n            M&E indictors that are outcome oriented. The project\n            also demonstrates the need for better baseline data that can\n            be compared against ex-post data. The use of Living\n            Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) data should only be\n            considered if there is a specific module for project\n            evaluation and a proper sampling

There are\n            three components to the project. 1) This component will\n            finance an estimated 200 sub-projects aimed at improving\n            local communities' infrastructure. Sub-projects will\n            cover both rural areas (about 120) and suburban areas (about\n            80). Eligible sub-projects, which will be based on the\n            priorities of communities, will include rural and suburban\n            roads, water supply, sewerage, lighting, pedestrian and\n            rural bridges, market-places, buildings (e.g., health\n            centers, schools, day care facilities, cultural centers),\n            and parks. 2)  This component will finance training and\n            technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of local\n            government, communities, and Albanian Development Fund (ADF)\n            staff. It will include three programs: capacity building for\n            ADF staff; local government and community capacity building,\n            and a participation pilot program. The pilot program will\n            introduce methods of participatory planning and\n            participatory monitoring and evaluation. It is expected that\n            this program would subsequently be rolled out to other parts\n            of the country. 3) This component will support the\n            implementation of the Community Works Project (CWP) by ADF\n            by financing a portion of ADF's operating costs\n            (maintenance and operation of equipment procured or used\n            under the project; salaries paid to ADF staff, other than\n            civil servants' salaries, hired for purposes of the\n            project; and consumable office supplies, communications,\n            fuel, travel
