Some lessons learned included: at\n            the time of project preparation, the education sector in\n            Rwanda faced numerous challenges which were complex and\n            diverse. The post-conflict nature of the country meant there\n            was significant political and social pressure to address a\n            multitude of issues through the Human Resources Development\n            Project (HRDP). However, one of the lessons learned from the\n            former education project was that project objectives need to\n            take account of local implementation capacity. Specifically,\n            it noted that project activities should not commence until\n            the technical and implementation capacity had reached the\n            required level. In most cases, post-conflict States have\n            weak or dysfunctional institutions and policies. In the case\n            of civil works activities, there may be very few local\n            contractors within the private sector who could provide the\n            required services given the risks of working in a\n            post-conflict environment. In addition, the risks for\n            international contractors may be too high to warrant their\n            involvement. Project designs which involve community driven\n            development processes need to nurture and support the huge\n            potential that exists at the community level. Bank task\n            teams should weigh the impact of adding new activities\n            towards the end of the project period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Human Resources Development
