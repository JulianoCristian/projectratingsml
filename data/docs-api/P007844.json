The lessons learned indicate that in the Loan\n            Agreement (schedule 6), it was stipulated that the Borrower\n            should provide funds for maintenance of the urban and\n            inter-urban roads through an annual budget allocation of\n            US$21.0 million. This was introduced as a Table but no\n            reference was made to a covenant clause within the Loan\n            Agreement (LOA). It would have been preferable to work under\n            the time-slice project in two phases. The first would have\n            been a transport rehabilitation project with technical\n            assistance to Ministry of Public Works (MOP) to streamline\n            its capacity to plan and manage projects and funds for the\n            preparation of the second phase. The second would have been\n            an urban transport project, including a quick disbursing\n            policy-based component, rehabilitation and maintenance\n            component, urban and road sub-projects with a technical\n            assistance to strengthen MOP and the regulating entity for\n            the urban public transport. An operational manual that\n            describes a summary framework of the project design,\n            policies, definitions, indicators, procurement procedures,\n            guidelines and plans should be agreed with the Bank, prior\n            to effectiveness. Successful implementation of the project\n            is highly dependent on the stability of key project\n            management staff, both at the local and Bank levels, and a\n            stable political environment. The project did not develop an\n            appropriate monitoring and evaluation system to follow\n            throughout the implementation period. Indigenous Peoples\n            Development Plan (IPDP) should have ownership from the\n            beneficiary indigenous communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Roads Rehabilitation

more\n            efficient, safe and reliable passenger transport services in\n            the city of Panama and other major cities in the country.\n            The project comprises the following components:  (1) an\n            urban transport component covering:  (a) street\n            rehabilitation and/or widening and maintenance, intersection\n            improvement, improved signalization and traffic management;\n            and (b) institutional reforms and regulatory changes in\n            public road transport; (2) an inter-urban roads component\n            comprising:  the improvement, rehabilitation and maintenance\n            of roads and bridges; and (3) a policy reform and an\n            institutional strengthening component aimed at:  (a)\n            reforming the regulatory policy of the for-hire road\n            transport services; (b) improving overall transport sector\n            planning and policy formulation, the institutional set-up\n            for managing urban transport, and MOP's capacity to\n            coordinate investments in the entire transport sector and to\n            address environmental issues; (c) training MOP staff to\n            prepare projects for private sector implementation and to\n            manage the contracts; and (d) preparing studies for possible\n            follow-up activities.  The other elements of the total road\n            program are justifiable road upgrading and improvement\n            investments, which the government intends to carry out\n            mostly under build, operate and transfer arrangements with\n            the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Roads Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Roads Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/11/733027/panama-roads-rehabilitation-project","projn":"PA-Roads Rehabilitation -- P007844","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Urban Transport,Roads & Highways,ICT Policy and Strategies,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Panama","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005090234"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"autonomy,Bridge,bridges,bus,bus\n            transport,cities,city streets,Competitive\n            Bidding,concessions,Consulting\n            Services,contractors,e,economic\n            reform,Government,gravel,gravel roads,high levels of traffic\n            congestion,Highway Design,highway\n            projects,highways,income,Indigenous Peoples,Institutional\n            Development,Land Transport,MDB,modes of transport,natural\n            resources,operating costs,Passenger,pavement,pavement\n            management,Ports,private operators,private\n            sector,privatization,productivity,programs,public\n            sector,quarrying,Railways,Rate of\n            Return,redundancy,regulatory reform,road financing,road\n            maintenance,road materials,Road Rehabilitation,Road\n            Signage,road systems,road traffic,road transport,road\n            transport industry,Roads,roadwork,routes,routine\n            maintenance,Rural Roads,Safety,Signalization,social\n            services,streets,technical assistance,Traffic,traffic\n            congestion,Traffic Management,Traffic Management\n            Schemes,Traffic Management Systems,Traffic Safety,traffic\n            volumes,transport sector,transport system,transport\n            tariffs,trucking,urban bus,urban bus transport,Urban\n            Development,Urban Passenger,Urban Passenger Transport,urban\n            roads,urban transport,vehicle ownership,Vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"autonomy,Bridge,bridges,bus,bus\n            transport,cities,city streets,Competitive\n            Bidding,concessions,Consulting\n            Services,contractors,e,economic\n            reform,Government,gravel,gravel roads,high levels of traffic\n            congestion,Highway Design,highway\n            projects,highways,income,Indigenous Peoples,Institutional\n            Development,Land Transport,MDB,modes of transport,natural\n            resources,operating costs,Passenger,pavement,pavement\n            management,Ports,private operators,private\n            sector,privatization,productivity,programs,public\n            sector,quarrying,Railways,Rate of\n            Return,redundancy,regulatory reform,road financing,road\n            maintenance,road materials,Road Rehabilitation,Road\n            Signage,road systems,road traffic,road transport,road\n            transport industry,Roads,roadwork,routes,routine\n            maintenance,Rural Roads,Safety,Signalization,social\n            services,streets,technical assistance,Traffic,traffic\n            congestion,Traffic Management,Traffic Management\n            Schemes,Traffic Management Systems,Traffic Safety,traffic\n            volumes,transport sector,transport system,transport\n            tariffs,trucking,urban bus,urban bus transport,Urban\n            Development,Urban Passenger,Urban Passenger Transport,urban\n            roads,urban transport,vehicle ownership,Vehicles"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"repnb":"P6168"},"facets":{}}}
