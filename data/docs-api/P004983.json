Lessons to be learned are: the absence of envelope\n            material could possibly lead to a shortened working life of\n            the drains as planned, and the flexibility shown by the\n            Government of Egypt and the Bank in accommodating drainage\n            needs as they arose and not rigidly adhering to areas\n            identified at appraisal was highly commendable.
