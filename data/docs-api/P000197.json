Overall, the project's achievements fell short\n            of expectations. This is not surprising given the political\n            turmoil that plagued the country during project\n            implementation. There are four important lessons that emerge\n            from the implementation of this project: (a) The design of\n            lines of credit to commercial banks, which more often than\n            not, lack the institutional capacity to manage the\n            complexities of such an operation, should be as simple as\n            possible avoiding excessive layers of review and approval.\n            (b) In a complex project such as this one, the technical and\n            regulatory/supervisory capacity of the APEX agency, in this\n            case Central Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB), is a\n            critical determinant of project success. (c) It is important\n            to find appropriate channels to provide technical assistance\n            to entrepreneurs in project management, marketing and basic\n            accounting, to help them run their business profitably. (d)\n            Future lines of credit should incorporate arrangements for\n            acceptable standards of project management and accounting.\n            Furthermore, the responsibility for promoting and managing\n            the line of credit should be separate from operations of the\n            Central Bank because of the inherent difference in these\n            activities. Finally, the Project should have had a special\n            account to ensure availability of funds during the\n            implementation period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Small Enterprise APEX Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi -
