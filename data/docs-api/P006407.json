Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) limiting rational project selection criteria to the\n            Bank project is insufficient. The Bank strategy for\n            introducing rational project selection criteria was limited\n            to the Bank project. The rationality of other investment\n            projects was to be achieved through the execution and\n            application of a marginal cost and pricing study, a limit on\n            increasing the investment program by more than 20 percent,\n            and the assumption that the same selection criteria would be\n            applied on the remaining components of the investment\n            program as well. Although Companhia de Saneamento Basico do\n            Estado de Sao Paulo (SABESP) after some delay executed the\n            marginal cost study, it never applied its recommendations.\n            The ceiling on additional investments was easily\n            circumvented by presenting some optimistic forecasts; 2) in\n            the case of time-slice investment financing; the project\n            scope should be defined by value instead of physical\n            composition. In standard investment projects, the physical\n            scope defines the design and content of the project which in\n            turn define its cost. In the type of project like the one\n            financed under this loan, this definition is not meaningful;\n            it was replaced by a value, which was set at USD600 million.\n            However, the project description in the Loan Agreement does\n            not include this amount, but rather defines the project as\n            consisting of eligible subprojects and institutional\n            development; and 3) political interference should be\n            reduced. The long-term and sustained performance of a\n            utility with competent staff like SABESP can be safeguarded\n            only by separating the utility from the political\n            administration and introducing competition and private\n            participation within the context of proper regulation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Water Sector Project in the State\n
