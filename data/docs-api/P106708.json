Some lessons learned included: an effective\n            operation is supported by strong analytics. A long tradition\n            of technical assistance, analysis and impact evaluations in\n            the context of ongoing Knowledge Services, policy or\n            investment operations was critical in the identification of\n            key reforms and in the design of specific elements of such\n            reforms. A long-term engagement facilitates the\n            implementation. This DPL built on a long series of financial\n            and technical services provided to Colombia in the area of\n            social protection over the past decade. A focused approach\n            serves to minimize Government transition risks. A single\n            tranche DPL in the midst of a Government transition always\n            pose challenges in the operational design. Reform is a\n            continuous process. Both the Government and the Bank team\n            were quite conscious that reform is a slow process and that\n            long term engagement yields more profound results than any\n            single operation could. A multi-sectoral operation is\n            manageable if the teams are selective in choosing a few key\n            strategies. While the operation covered many policy areas,\n            it only supported a few key actions within each of them.\n            Still, the fact that these policy areas were at different\n            stages of advance posed challenges of selecting appropriate\n            indicators to monitor. Strong coordination on the\n            Government's side is necessary when many ministries are involved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Development Policy Loan (DPL) on\n            Promoting an

Protection System Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Colombian economy is facing the\n            impacts of a sharp aggregate demand contraction, but sound\n            macroeconomic policies implemented in recent years have\n            substantially improved the country's economic\n            resilience against crisis. In the near term, economic\n            activity is likely to reverse its decline and the\n            Bank's base scenario for Colombia includes gross\n            domestic product (GDP) growth of 0.4 percent in 2009 and a\n            modest rebound of economic activity in 2010. Despite the\n            impact of global conditions, Colombia is in a better\n            position to confront the global crisis than other Latin\n            America and Caribbean (LAC) countries, as a result of its\n            countercyclical monetary policy and fiscal stimulus over\n            2009. While there remains uncertainty as regards to the\n            depth and length of the global recession, neither external\n            nor fiscal sustainability appear at risk. The operation\n            proposes to consolidate past gains and support the reform\n            agenda in areas that need strengthening and consolidation.\n            The development objective of the operation is to strengthen\n            an inclusive, equitable and efficient social protection\n            system by: (1) promoting greater integration, efficiency and\n            equity of social insurance, (2) improving the targeting,\n            efficiency, and articulation of social assistance programs,\n            and (3) promoting higher quality training and employment\n            services. To achieve this objective, the operation supports\n            policies in a broad range of areas, in particular: 1)\n            efforts to increase the coverage of inclusive systems\n            serving the entire population such as the national training\n            and labor intermediation system or health insurance; 2)\n            efforts to build an equitable system that serves the poor\n            and vulnerable through improved targeting and coordination\n            of social assistance and greater efforts to reach the\n            poorest; 3) and efforts to increase the efficiency of social\n            protection through improved information systems,\n            rationalization, simplification of processes, and\n            improvements in program design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Development Policy Loan (DPL) on\n            Promoting an Inclusive, Equitable and Efficient Social\n            Protection System
