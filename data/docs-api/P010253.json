The outcome of the\n            project was satisfactory. It fully achieved its ambitious\n            institutional objectives. Responsibility for\n            groundwater-based irrigation and vertical drainage was\n            successfully transferred to the private sector without the\n            angry demonstrations that had been anticipated. Despite\n            having to absorb irrigation and drainage costs, farmers were\n            able to increase their productivity enough to come out\n            ahead. The sustainability of the project is likely. The main\n            lesson from this pilot project is that Pakistan and the Bank\n            lost an early opportunity to save significant operations and\n            maintenance expenditures because they hung onto the public\n            sector SCARP model for too long. From inception of the idea\n            for a transition project in 1980, it took more than a decade\n            to prove it would work. In preparing the follow-on projects,\n            both the Bank and Borrower are mindful of the lessons of the\n            SCARP Transition Pilot Project. The new project will focus\n            its promotional efforts exclusively on community-owned wells\n            rather than a large number of underutilized individually\n            owned wells because community-owned wells will provide the\n            greatest social benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, in future projects,\n            diesel-operated tubewells should be favored over electrical\n            tubewells because their installation avoids costly\n            distribution systems and connections. Second, large\n            government subsidies are not needed to encourage farmers to\n            install their own diesel-powered tubewells. Third, project\n            supervisory consultants should be appointed at an early\n            stage, preferably before negotiations, in order to avoid\n            inordinate implementation delays. Fourth, increased IDA\n            assistance may be needed for procurement of equipment\n            through ICB procedures. Fifth, the responsibility for\n            reviewing designs of on-farm water management (OFWM) works\n            should be given to the project supervisory consultants in\n            order to ensure design consistency. Finally, more attention\n            should be given to monitoring and evaluation, particularly\n            in this type of pilot project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Salinity Control and Reclamation\n            (SCARP) Transition Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -
