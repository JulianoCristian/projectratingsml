The changes are as follows:\n            (i) modifying the project development objective (PDO) and\n            its associated outcome/intermediate indicators, by dropping\n            activities pertaining to the rehabilitation and upgrading of\n            Port Assab due to the effects of the 1999-2001 war between\n            Ethiopia and the Recipient during which time no Project\n            activity could be undertaken on the Port; (ii) introducing\n            new Project activities on constructing a new oil jetty and\n            undertaking emergency repairs on the existing aged oil\n            jetty, both at Port Massawa; (iii) reallocating funds among\n            the disbursement categories; and (iv) extending the current\n            closing date of the project from September 30, 2008 to\n            December 31, 2011. The changes will advance the attainment\n            of the Project objectives by increasing the Recipient's\n            Port productivity and capacity needs as well as addressing\n            possible disruption of oil supply to the Recipient and\n            averting the potential environmental hazard posed if the\n            existing oil jetty collapses. In addition, the changes\n            support the Bank's interim strategy note\n            recommendations of focusing on improving the implementation\n            of the existing interventions through restructuring rather\n            than financing new operations which are currently limited to\n            humanitarian and social vulnerability support in the\n            Recipient's rural areas. The changes are a response to\n            the effects of the intermittent war between Ethiopia and the\n            Recipient during 1999-2001 period and continued border\n            tension between the two countries. This situation has\n            necessitated the change in the PDO and project design,\n            including dropping some project activities and introducing\n            new ones, some of which have their preparation,\n            implementation, and completion dates extending beyond the\n            current credit closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eritrea -

The present project, Rehabilitation of\n            berths 5 & 6 includes repair of a collapsed section of\n            the existing quay, establishment of a new quay section with\n            12 meters water depth, dredging and reclamation. The project\n            further includes clearing of part of the port area and\n            provision of new cargo handling equipment. The berth\n            rehabilitation is assumed to lead to a slight increase in\n            the water circulation within the port. The construction of\n            berths will cause minor temporary impacts but will not cause\n            lasting damage to the marine environment. The material to be\n            dredged is suitable for reclamation purposes and free from\n            contamination of heavy metals. The possibility of spillage\n            during dredging and reclamation shall be minimized by the\n            use of a suction dredger, installation of a sheet pile wall,\n            and a survey and subsequent removal of all unexploded\n            ordinances. Residents within port boundaries will be\n            resettled into adequate alternative housing. The port will\n            establish improved procedures for handling and storing\n            hazardous and noxious cargo. Facilities are suggested to\n            handle ship waste.

The present project, Rehabilitation of\n            berths 5 & 6 includes repair of a collapsed section of\n            the existing quay, establishment of a new quay section with\n            12 meters water depth, dredging and reclamation. The project\n            further includes clearing of part of the port area and\n            provision of new cargo handling equipment. The berth\n            rehabilitation is assumed to lead to a slight increase in\n            the water circulation within the port. The construction of\n            berths will cause minor temporary impacts but will not cause\n            lasting damage to the marine environment. The material to be\n            dredged is suitable for reclamation purposes and free from\n            contamination of heavy metals. The possibility of spillage\n            during dredging and reclamation shall be minimized by the\n            use of a suction dredger, installation of a sheet pile wall,\n            and a survey and subsequent removal of all unexploded\n            ordinances. Residents within port boundaries will be\n            resettled into adequate alternative housing. The port will\n            establish improved procedures for handling and storing\n            hazardous and noxious cargo. Facilities are suggested to\n            handle ship waste. An oil spill contingency plan will be\n            drawn up and recovery equipment procured. Negative impacts\n            includes: air, water quality, and oily wastes. (a) the main\n            mitigation measures here are to carry out maintenance and\n            repair work on vehicles and machines in dedicated areas with\n            sealed surfaces and water treatment facilities, and to store\n            fuels, lubricants and chemicals in safe places away from\n            water; (b) use only adequate and well maintained\n            construction and transportation equipment including diesel\n            fuel of good quality. The reduction of particulate (soot)\n            emitted by diesel engines is by far the most efficient\n            measure for keeping the air pollution low; and  (c) oil is a\n            common form of pollution that could cause a lot of damage in\n            areas of noted sensitivity. As such, steps should be taken\n            to ensure that it is not released into the sea or allowed to\n            seep into the ground.
