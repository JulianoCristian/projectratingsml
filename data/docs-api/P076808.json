Some of the lessons\n            learned were: 1. There was a clear impact on Government\n            ownership of the reform program; 2. The increased\n            harmonization among the development partners (DPs) under the\n            Multi-Donor Budgetary Support (MDBS) framework contributed\n            to the successful implementation of PRSC 1-3 and thus had\n            high returns; 3.
