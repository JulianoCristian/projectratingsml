The project aimed to\n            improve the quality and number of trained manpower in the\n            beneficiary states by seeking to: (a) improve the quality of\n            facilities and instruction; (b) increase capacity in the\n            OECS for Technical and Vocational Education and Training;\n            and (c) enhance sector management. The Project's\n            physical objectives were substantially achieved, resulting\n            in a significant increase in technical and vocational\n            education capacity in the participating countries. The main\n            lessons learned from the review of this operation are the\n            following: 1) The Association should have more closely\n            assessed the Borrower's implementation capacity, and\n            carefully evaluated the local procurement and project\n            implementation capabilities at the time of project design;\n            2) Appointment of a full-time project manager in each\n            participating country was essential to ensure the smooth\n            operation of daily activities; 3) Architectural designs\n            should have been considerably advanced and agreed upon at\n            the time of negotiations; 4) Adequate provisions for\n            preventive maintenance and repair work for all\n            project-supported facilities should have been made in the\n            annual Government budget; and 5) Most suitable use of each\n            co-financier funds should have been carefully assessed at appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Eastern Caribbean States -
