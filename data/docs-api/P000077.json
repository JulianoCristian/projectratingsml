technical assistance to the feeder roads division\n            within the Ministry of Public Works for carrying out civil\n            works, project monitoring, staff training and the\n            preparation of future feeder roads programs. Project\n            benefits will accrue to farmers who will have year-round\n            access to markets for their surplus production, and\n            transporters in the form of savings from reduced vehicle\n            operating costs. Institutional strengthening will also be a\n            major benefit. Project risks are limited."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Deuxieme projet de routes de desserte"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"B\u00e9nin \u2013 Deuxi\u00e8me projet de routes\n            de desserte : B\u00e9nin\u00a0- Deuxi\u00e8me Projet de routes de desserte"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/12/11962512/benin-second-feeder-roads-project-benin-deuxieme-projet-de-routes-de-desserte","projn":"BJ-Feeder Roads-266138 -- P000077","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Environmental Economics & Policies,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Agricultural Research","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Environment,Transport,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100318004546"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Transport,Agriculture,Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Construction; Fuels; Hand tools; Lubricants;\n            Maintenance & repair; Maintenance equipment; Roads &\n            highways; Spare parts; Vehicles,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Construction; Fuels; Hand tools; Lubricants;\n            Maintenance & repair; Maintenance equipment; Roads &\n            highways; Spare parts; Vehicles,,"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"3050","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Benin - Deuxieme projet de routes de desserte"}}},"facets":{}}}
