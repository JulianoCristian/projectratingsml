Some lessons learned included: bank\n            preparation of investment projects that target environmental\n            improvements should deploy relevant specialized technical\n            knowhow and experience effectively so that environmental\n            problem are properly appraised and feasible targets set for\n            improvements. For this project, illegal sewage discharge,\n            that continues to pollute the river, needed more analysis\n            and preventative action, while river water quality targets\n            should have been more modest and achievable over a\n            reasonable time period. The preparation of components in\n            investment projects, especially key ones such as the Betim\n            Central sewage treatment plant, should routinely take into\n            account land acquisition, land use zoning, stakeholder\n            commitment and site difficulties, to set a realistic and\n            achievable path to implementation. Policies and actions to\n            curb the causes of environmental degradation should be at\n            the core of operations designed to improve the urban\n            environment. The lesson from this project is the need to\n            include measures to curb the illegal discharge of sewage,\n            observed on site by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG)\n            mission in Betim that, if not curtailed, could bypass the\n            environmental gains made by additional sewage treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Integrated Municipal Project -\n

         outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was

management projects: (i)\n            municipalities are the primary actors in urban development:\n            therefore, it is essential that in these type of projects a\n            sense of priority and ownership is created among key actors\n            in the municipal administration (mayor, secretaries and\n            senior staff); (ii) integrated urban development projects\n            such as these enhance local governments' capacity to\n            manage complex interventions as well as strategic thinking\n            on how cities must be (institutionally and physically)\n            shaped; (iii) complex urban development projects can be\n            managed effectively by medium-sized municipalities with a\n            reasonable institutional and operational capacity; however,\n            external support (by the Bank, consultants, etc.) is\n            critical, especially in key issues such as project design,\n            institutional strengthening, organizational reengineering,\n            resettlement, complex engineering tasks, and fiduciary\n            issues; and (iv) inter-sectoral arrangements cannot work at\n            the level of the project or of the project management unit\n            (UGP) alone; they must already exist, or be created in the\n            municipality as a whole."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Integrated

(Municipality of Betim)for\n            Brazil evaluates the existing conditions, identifies the\n            potential direct and indirect environmental impacts and\n            proposes adequate mitigation measures for each negative\n            impact identified, as well as measures for enhancing each\n            identified positive impact. As part of the project\n            objectives and design, the Project has a strong\n            environmental emphasis, including strengthening the\n            environmental institutional capacity of the environmental\n            secretariat and the capacity of the regional river basin\n            committee. Moreover, the Project will review environmental\n            policies and regulations in order to scale up the municipal\n            capacity to respond to the environmental  needs at the local\n            level. While the Project is expected to result in\n            significant positive impacts for biodiversity and natural\n            habitats, short-term impacts to riverine habitats will\n            result from making drainage improvements. These impacts will\n            be more than mitigated by project interventions to\n            rehabilitate Betim River tributaries through eradicating and\n            treating polluting sources (building a wastewater treatment\n            plant), resettling populations living within the\n            floodplains, creating urban parks, and restoring wetland\n            vegetation along the project waterways. Also, the project\n            will ensure that urban drainage emphasizes the selection of\n            alternatives that 1) maximize preservation, to the extent\n            possible, of existing watercourses and \"mata\n            ciliar\" vegetation; 2) use adjacent spaces to create or\n            augment linear parks to promote environmental awareness\n            among residents and to buffer urban impacts to streams; and\n            3) strengthen the protection of existing parks or protected\n            areas to maximize the long-term sustainability of water\n            quality improvements. An environmental construction manual\n            appended to all project infrastructure-related contracts\n            will include activities to minimize and mitigate\n            construction-related activities (such as noise, air\n            pollution from dust, and water pollution from dredge\n            sediments). Other activities involve public awareness and\n            environmental education, replacement housing and cash\n            compensation for involuntary displaced  households,\n            identification of illegal household sewerage connections,\n            dam safety and flood control management, technical and\n            safety procedures for flood-retention basins, and dredge\n            transport and disposal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Anexos"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Integrated Municipal\n            Project - Betim Municipality : environmental assessment\n            (Vol. 3) : Anexos"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/05/4297218/brazil-integrated-municipal-project-betim-municipality-environmental-assessment-vol-3-anexos","projn":"BR-Integrated Municipal Project - Betim\n            Municipality -- P082328","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Brazil","authors":{"authr":"Betim, Brazil"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040616144051"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Portuguese","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental monitoring; Institutional\n            capacity building; River basin management; River water\n            quality; Dam maintenance procedures; Dam safety;\n            Biodiversity conservation; Natural habitats; Drainage\n            impacts; Dredged materials; Solid waste management;\n            Wastewater treatment; Involuntary resettlement; Protected\n            areas; weltand restoration; Vegetative propagation;\n            Protected flora; Public awareness; Environmental education;\n            Water quality management; Noise abatement; Air pollution\n            control; Floodplain management; Sewerage services"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"E867","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Brasil - Projeto de Revitalizacao Urbana\n            e Recuperacao Ambiental da Bacia do Rio Betim : avaliacao ambiental"}}},"2889349":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/02/2889349/brazil-integrated-municipal-project-betim-municipality-environmental-assessment-executive-summary","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/02/2889349/brazil-integrated-municipal-project-betim-municipality-environmental-assessment-executive-summary","new_url":"2004/02/2889349/brazil-integrated-municipal-project-betim-municipality-environmental-assessment-executive-summary","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/09/000160016_20040209143635/Rendered/INDEX/278350BR.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/02/09/000160016_20040209143635/Rendered/PDF/278350BR.pdf","datestored":"2004-02-09T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-02-05T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Integrated Municipal Project -\n            Betim Municipality : environmental assessment executive summary"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Betim Integrated Municipal Project\n            for Brazil finances a secondary sewerage network; a sewerage\n            treatment plant, drainage improvements, and secondary roads.\n            This environmental assessment anticipates negative\n            environmental impacts resulting from construction and\n            suggests mitigation measures.

As part of the project\n            objectives and design, the Project has a strong\n            environmental emphasis, including strengthening the\n            environmental institutional capacity of the environmental\n            secretariat and the capacity of the regional river basin\n            committee. Moreover, the Project will review environmental\n            policies and regulations in order to scale up the municipal\n            capacity to respond to the environmental  needs at the local\n            level. While the Project is expected to result in\n            significant positive impacts for biodiversity and natural\n            habitats, short-term impacts to riverine habitats will\n            result from making drainage improvements. These impacts will\n            be more than mitigated by project interventions to\n            rehabilitate Betim River tributaries through eradicating and\n            treating polluting sources (building a wastewater treatment\n            plant), resettling populations living within the\n            floodplains, creating urban parks, and restoring wetland\n            vegetation along the project waterways. Also, the project\n            will ensure that urban drainage emphasizes the selection of\n            alternatives that 1) maximize preservation, to the extent\n            possible, of existing watercourses and \"mata\n            ciliar\" vegetation; 2) use adjacent spaces to create or\n            augment linear parks to promote environmental awareness\n            among residents and to buffer urban impacts to streams; and\n            3) strengthen the protection of existing parks or protected\n            areas to maximize the long-term sustainability of water\n            quality improvements. An environmental construction manual\n            appended to all project infrastructure-related contracts\n            will include activities to minimize and mitigate\n            construction-related activities (such as noise, air\n            pollution from dust, and water pollution from dredge\n            sediments). Other activities involve public awareness and\n            environmental education, replacement housing and cash\n            compensation for involuntary displaced  households,\n
