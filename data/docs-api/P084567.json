Some lessons learned included: it\n            is recommended that the grant-based financing scheme be\n            piloted in new schools to test its attractiveness and\n            merits, its potential impact on school performance as well\n            as to appreciate the degree of buy-in by teachers and School\n            Management Committees (SMCs). Ministry of Education (MOE) is\n            shifting to grants-based financing system, where resources\n            going to institutions will be linked more closely to\n            students on a per capita basis, rather than to teachers as\n            it is currently the case. A draft grants-based financing\n            system has been finalized but not yet adopted and a decision\n            was taken to suspend Monthly Pay Order (MPO) for new non\n            government schools. As a result, newly registered schools\n            are likely to experience financial constraints which may\n            have adverse effect on their performance. There is a need to\n            improve the capacity of Bangladesh Bureau of Education\n            Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) to provide regular\n            updates on schools and better monitor education outcomes\n            since the last school census was conducted in 1999 and an\n            update was undertaken in 2005. BANBEIS is expecting to start\n            by June 2008 the next census as it is already approved and\n            the process of releasing the funds has begun. There may also\n            be a need to develop a platform for integrating multiple\n            databases that fall under MOE as was already evidenced by\n            the uniformization of school codes between Education Boards\n            and BANBEIS. This integration process, across various units\n            of MOE, would, for instance, help to institutionalize\n            student learning assessment as Secondary Education Quality\n            and Access Enhancement Project (SEQAEP) project intends to\n            do by benchmarking learning levels in Bangladesh to\n            international standards such as Trends in International\n            Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) or Program for\n            International Student Assessment (PISA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Education Sector Development\n            Support

access to secondary education. The reform agenda focuses\n            on: 1) Accountability, - with reforms enforcing the\n            establishment of institutions, and institutional mechanisms\n            to link school subventions to objective measures of school\n            performance. 2) Equity - through demand-side interventions\n            to encourage rural girls' attendance at secondary\n            schooling. 3) Administration/Capacity Building - to\n            strengthen MoE's planning and policy making capacity,\n            and, towards greater implementation responsibility at lower\n            levels. 4) Monitoring, Evaluation and Dissemination -\n            significantly emphasizing program evaluation and monitoring\n            to guide policy and planning. Public expenditure tracking\n            surveys and impact evaluation of programs are being\n            undertaken. 5) Teachers' Quality -through the\n            establishment of an autonomous Non-Government Teacher\n            Registration and Certification Authority, responsible for\n            the development and selection for the pre-qualification and\n            certification of teachers. An apex institution will be\n            responsible for the management of teacher training, and to\n            regulate training institutions. 6) Textbook Production and\n            Curriculum Development - through the National Curriculum and\n            Textbook Board (NCTB), a transparent process of textbook\n            evaluation and approval will be achieved, with the\n            curriculum wing of NCTB being strengthened to enable its\n            performance effectively. While risks exist, namely in the\n            macroeconomic aspect, political climate, in corruption, and\n            capacity constraints, actions are being taken in economic\n            management and fiscal adjustment; there is strong\n            stakeholder support, and reforms are being openly\n            publicized; and, the project strategy is designed to deliver\n            benefits that far outweigh the risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Programmatic Education\n            Sector Development Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - 2nd Programmatic\n            Education Sector Development Support Credit Project :\n            Bangladesh - Second Programmatic Education Sector\n            Development Support Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/02/6602006/bangladesh-2nd-programmatic-education-sector-development-support-credit-project-bangladesh-second-programmatic-education-sector-development-support-credit-project","projn":"BD-Education Sector Development Support\n            Credit II -- P084567","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Education For All","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20060216093300"},"subsc":"Other social services,Vocational training,Secondary education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to education, access to schooling,\n            access to secondary education, achievements, achieving\n            gender parity, child malnutrition, Community Participation,\n            community schools, completion rates, cost per student,\n            curricula, Curriculum Development, demand for education,\n            Development Goals, Donor Support, dropout rates, economic\n            growth, economic reforms, education, education budget,\n            Education Development, Education For All, education level,\n            Education Management, education programs, education quality,\n            Education Reforms, EDUCATION SECTOR, education spending,\n            education system, educational access, Educational\n            Management, educational opportunities, effective teachers,\n            enrollment rate, enrollment rates, equitable access,\n            equitable education, exams, expanded access, female\n            enrollment, Female Secondary School Assistance, gender\n            parity, governance, high dropout, Higher Education, higher\n            enrollment, Household Income, Human Development,\n            interventions, labor force, learning, life expectancy,\n            Literacy, local level, Mass Education, National Curriculum,\n            performance indicators, policy reform, positive impact,\n            potential benefits, Poverty Reduction, Primary Education,\n            Primary Education Development, Primary Education Development\n            Program, primary enrollment, primary enrollment rates,\n            primary level, printing, private partnerships, private\n            schools, Project, Public Expenditure, public funding,\n            pupils, quality education, quality standards, quality\n            textbooks, Reform Education, regular attendance, religious\n            schools, rural girls, sanitation, School Certificate, School\n            Children, school enrollment, School Establishment, School\n            Management, School Management Committees, school mapping,\n            school performance, school quality, school supervision,\n            schooling, schools, Secondary Certificate, Secondary\n            Education, secondary enrollment, secondary level, Secondary\n            School, secondary schools, social development, Stipends,\n            strengthening school management, student achievement,\n            Teacher, teacher absenteeism, teacher certification, Teacher\n            Effectiveness, teacher recruitment, teacher salaries,\n            teacher training, teacher training institutions, Teachers,\n            teaching, teaching staff, Technical Education, tertiary\n            education, Textbook, Textbook approval, Textbook Board,\n            textbook manuscripts, Textbook Production, Textbook\n            publishing, textbooks, tuition, tuition waivers, untrained\n            teachers, vocational education, Vocational Training"}},"owner":"S.A.
