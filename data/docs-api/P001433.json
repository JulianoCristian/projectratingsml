The Bank maintained a firm position\n            on scaling down the size of the project to meet\n            Monrovia's immediate needs while the institutional\n            structure was being enhanced to become capable of managing a\n            more extensive long-term expansion program. The Bank also\n            remained firm in insisting that all feasible alternatives be\n            evaluated in order to identify the best possible approach to\n            meet the project's objective. The physical components\n            of the project have been very successfully completed. The\n            management improvement/technical assistance component of the\n            project was useful in that it enhanced the Liberia Water and\n            Sewer Corporation (LWSC)'s ability to manage operations\n            and construction during critical periods of project\n            implementation, but unfortunately it did not produce the\n            significant long-term institutional improvements envisioned\n            at appraisal. Political and economic factors outside of\n            LWSC's and the Bank's control certainly were\n            responsible, at least in part, for the failure of this\n            component to fully meet its stated objectives. Even more\n            significant, LWSC's lack of support and enthusiasm for\n            this component was not overcome in the course of project\n            supervision and ultimately became a self-fulfilling prophecy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia -

To achieve these\n            objectives, the project would assist in improving and\n            expanding water production, treatment and distribution\n            facilities for the Monrovia area, undertaking a\n            comprehensive nation-wide sector study and providing\n            management improvement and staff training programs. At least\n            50,000 new low income consumers in Monrovia would have\n            access to safe, potable water through the provision of\n            public standpipe service under the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Monrovia Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Liberia - Monrovia Water Supply Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/11/726873/liberia-monrovia-water-supply-project","projn":"LR-Water Supply I-319620 -- P001433","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Sanitation and Sewerage,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Liberia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912390688"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban water supply","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            supply,aquifers,Billing,chemical dosing,competitive\n            bidding,connection charges,construction,discharge,disposal\n            system,distribution system,Distribution Systems,domestic\n            sewage,domestic water,Drinking Water,Electricity,gpcd,ground\n            water,hand pump,human waste,igneous rocks,Illegal\n            Connections,infiltration,iron,Least Cost,Mining,number of\n            connections,oxidation,oxidation ponds,piped\n            water,pipeline,piping,pit latrines,ponds,Population\n            Growth,programs,project management,Public Health,Public\n            Utilities,public water,public water supplies,public water\n            supply,pumping,pumping station,pumps,raw water,rivers,Rural\n            Water,rural water supply,safe water,safe water supply,saline\n            water,saline water intrusion,sand,sand\n            filters,Sanitation,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            services,sea,septic tanks,service area,service\n            connections,Sewerage,Sewerage system,sludge,sludge\n            digestion,soils,standpipes,storage\n            capacity,swamps,towns,trickling filtration,trunk\n            sewers,urban areas,Urban Water,Urban Water Supply,Urban\n            Water Supply Systems,valves,waste disposal,waste disposal\n            system,WATER DEMAND,water meters,Water Resources,water\n            storage,Water Supplies,Water Supply,water supply\n            facilities,Water Supply Operations,water supply\n            projects,water supply services,Water Supply System,water\n            system,water treatment,water treatment plant,well drilling,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"adequate water,adequate water\n            supply,aquifers,Billing,chemical dosing,competitive\n            bidding,connection charges,construction,discharge,disposal\n            system,distribution system,Distribution Systems,domestic\n            sewage,domestic water,Drinking Water,Electricity,gpcd,ground\n            water,hand pump,human waste,igneous rocks,Illegal\n            Connections,infiltration,iron,Least Cost,Mining,number of\n            connections,oxidation,oxidation ponds,piped\n            water,pipeline,piping,pit latrines,ponds,Population\n            Growth,programs,project management,Public Health,Public\n            Utilities,public water,public water supplies,public water\n            supply,pumping,pumping station,pumps,raw water,rivers,Rural\n            Water,rural water supply,safe water,safe water supply,saline\n            water,saline water intrusion,sand,sand\n            filters,Sanitation,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            services,sea,septic tanks,service area,service\n            connections,Sewerage,Sewerage system,sludge,sludge\n            digestion,soils,standpipes,storage\n            capacity,swamps,towns,trickling filtration,trunk\n            sewers,urban areas,Urban Water,Urban Water Supply,Urban\n            Water Supply Systems,valves,waste disposal,waste disposal\n            system,WATER DEMAND,water meters,Water Resources,water\n            storage,Water Supplies,Water Supply,water supply\n            facilities,Water Supply Operations,water supply\n            projects,water supply services,Water Supply System,water\n            system,water treatment,water treatment plant,well drilling,wells"}},"owner":"Country Director Groups","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"1981"},"facets":{}}}
