Some\n            lessons learned included: in project design there is a need\n            to be sensitive to the institutional capacity of the\n            country. If it lies on the lower end of the spectrum,\n            complex or ambitious project design will not be feasible\n            within that context as the learning curve maybe too steep.\n            Systems in place are not effective if not exercised,\n            especially for problematic projects in the portfolio. The\n            project would have done better if there had been fewer\n            cities with suitable measurement mechanisms which informed\n            on the progress of the pilots and allowed for adjustments\n            accordingly. It is important to assess the need to\n            restructure the project earlier rather than later. If the\n            extenuating circumstances of the project justify a full or\n            partial restructuring, or a loan amount cancellation,\n            reducing or omitting the scope of component/sub-component,\n            action should be pursued effectively by the project team in\n            a timely manner. It is important that the Bank understands\n            and serves the client's needs when there has been\n            little previous interaction by preparing upfront capacity\n            building on Bank's processes and procedures. The\n            project faced major difficulties and delays in salary\n            payments to its staff as they were financed through the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Urban Upgrading and

To achieve the above, a three\n            phase Adaptable Program Loan was prepared and is spread over\n            a period of twelve years. The key development objectives of\n            this project (APL1) are to (i) improve the living conditions\n            in under-serviced neighborhoods in up to five provincial\n            capital cities and; (ii) prepare the systems, capacity, and\n            regulatory foundation and initiate market based housing\n            sector reforms. The Project objectives will be achieved\n            through three main components: (i) urban upgrading and\n            community enabling programs in up to 5 selected cities; (ii)\n

Roads rehabilitation works will\n            potentially cause clogging of natural drainage channels, and\n            disturb storm water drainage; it is thus proposed to\n            maintain ditches, and provide drainage facilities, to be the\n            responsibility of contractors, and municipalities,\n            respectively. Likewise, it will be the contractor's\n            responsibility to appropriately dispose of construction\n            wastes, and implement dust control measures, such as water\n            spraying construction surfaces, and dirt roads, while it\n            shall be the municipalities responsibility to inform, and\n            coordinate with the appropriate government agency, should\n            unknown archaeological finds occur. To minimize cross\n            contamination of sewage and water lines due to pressure\n            differentials, and leaks, as well as possible water\n            reductions during construction of the water supply and\n            wastewater networks, the Water and Wastewater Company should\n            coordinate with each agency, and review the area's\n            water balance. Municipalities, and the community shall be\n            responsible during schools construction, to avoid\n            encroachment following an adequate sites location, that\n            ensures compliance with urban planning, and appropriate\n            accessible roads, and basic infrastructure. Sites prone to\n            flooding, and earthquakes, should be avoided as possible,\n            otherwise appropriate engineering design measures, and\n            seismic resistance should be ensured. The provision of\n            adequate water quantity and quality should be ensured, and\n            priority should be given to the installation of toilets,\n            appropriate sanitation (cesspools), and disposal of solid wastes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran -
