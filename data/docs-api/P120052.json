Some lessons\n            learned included: local committees, involving\n            representatives of farmer organizations and municipalities,\n            are the key to proper management and maintenance of storage\n            facilities, drying areas, and irrigation infrastructure. The\n            resolution of land tenure issues should be a prerequisite\n            for all rural project investments. Input subsidies can be\n            the easiest mechanism for many governments to boost food\n            crop production and mitigate the negative impact of food\n            crises, but experience with Emergency Food Security Program\n            (PUASA) showed that although starting an input subsidy\n            scheme could be a good idea in the short run, it is rarely\n            sustainable in the long term because of state budgetary\n            constraints. The challenge is to implement a sound market\n            based mechanism, e.g. the warrantage system as pursued under\n            the project in order to provide an adequate exit. Recent\n            reforms in Benin's procurement administration and\n            system must be implemented effectively by all ministries for\n            projects to be implemented more

objective of the Emergency Support\n            to Enhance Food Security Project for Benin is to increase\n            domestic production of food crops (mainly maize and rice) in\n            targeted areas. Between September 2007 and August 2008 food\n            prices in Benin increased by an estimated 32 percent. This\n            unprecedented increase in food prices fueled a significant\n            increase in the general price levels (by 12 percent) over\n            the same period, prompting the government to enact a variety\n            of  measures to control prices (the cost of which is\n            unsustainable) and seek the assistance of donors to support\n            an emergency food security program. The Government launched\n            the Programme d'Urgence d'Appui a la Securite\n            Alimentaire (PUASA) - the Emergency Food Security Support\n            Program, in 2008 to address the country's immediate,\n            short and medium term needs to increase domestic productive\n            capacity and food security. The International Development\n            Association (IDA)-financed Emergency Food Security Support\n            Project (EFSSP), approved in October 2008 supported this\n            effort and focused on immediate needs by increasing the\n            access of cereal crop producers to fertilizer during the\n            2009 cropping season."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Emergency Support to
