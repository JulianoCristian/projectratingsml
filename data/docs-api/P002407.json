The experience\n            of these two operations convey the following. Projects\n            implemented in countries with an ongoing conflict, should be\n            continually monitored to identify, and assess the conflict\n            risk to the projects. First, under continuing high risk\n            conditions, thus project implementation likely to prove\n            counterproductive, by exposing the Bank and Borrower to\n            compensation and other claims, the Bank might consider\n            disengagement until the environment improves. Second, upon\n            resuming project implementation following a substantial\n            period of inactivity due to conflict, technical and\n            financial audits should be carried out to reassess\n            priorities for action, as well as, and any remedial measures\n            needed to secure completed activities. Third, when a country\n            is in, or emerging from conflict, the Bank may need to adopt\n            a more flexible approach to borrower compliance with\n            reform-related loan covenants. A realistic timeframe should\n            be agreed when attempting to introduce unpopular reforms in\n            the context of violence, and social instability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone -

It is particularly important to note that, in\n            order to consolidate progress in institutional development\n            (to be strengthened by additional funding for road\n            rehabilitation, and maintenance as needed), the\n            implementation of a follow-up project - Transport Sector\n            Project - became paramount, given the context of the country\n            at that time. However, the Sierra Leone Roads Authority\n            (SLRA) Act separating the Road Fund from the Ministry of\n            Works, though an improvement over previous arrangements,\n            would have better improved transparency, and accountability,\n            had the Road Fund's resource mobilization been\n            separated from the SLRA operations.
