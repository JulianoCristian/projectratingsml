It recommends the establishment and\n            protection of the five most important coastal wetlands as\n            Ramsar sites: Keta lagoon, Songor, Sakumo, Densu delta and\n            Muni. It outlines a management strategy for the selected\n            sites and defines institutional framework and mechanisms for\n            the implementation of the conservation actions proposed\n            (section one). Sections two-five provides detailed\n            management plans for four of the sites, Muni, Songor,\n            Sakumo, and Densu delta. The fourth site, Keta, is a special\n            case. Although the site is the most important seashore bird\n            site on the Ghana coast, it is also the most problematic.\n            The international importance of the Keta lagoon and the\n            socio-ecological problems in the area are high-lighted; and\n            recommendations on studies required for the preparation of\n            detailed management plans for the site are given in section\n            six. Section seven identifies training needs and technical\n            assistance requirements; and also provides a phased plan for\n            implementation of the proposed programs. Cost estimates are\n            given in section eight. It should be emphasized at this\n            point that the preparation of a management plan is a dynamic\n            process. The plans outlined here were based on the\n            information currently available on the sites. As more data\n            become available through the scientific studies recommended,\n            it would be necessary to review and update the plans as and\n            when necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Coastal wetlands management plans"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Coastal wetlands\n            management
