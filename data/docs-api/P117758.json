were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: targeting is a\n            key element of implementing successful social protection\n            interventions. It will be imperative that further targeting\n            reviews are done to the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP)\n            and other key social protection programs. Such reviews\n            should be encouraged as part of implementation both at the\n            geographical and household levels and results used to make\n            design improvements in the programs. Harmonization and\n            alignment of donor and Government of Rwanda (GoR)\n            interventions reduce transaction costs for the GoR and\n            translate into better programmatic interventions. Timing of\n            bank support, especially in a program with far-reaching\n            impacts, to coincide with bank's Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) and the inception of a government program,\n            can be critical. The existence of decentralized governance\n            and management structures highly facilitates successful\n            implementation of community-targeted social protection\n            reforms. Parallel technical assistance support to a\n            Development Policy Lending (DPL) operation is the key to\n            successful reforms. Continuous systems analysis and taking\n            corrective action should be part and parcel of the\n            implementation process. There is a growing body of empirical\n            evidence of the use of incentives to reward health service\n            provides for specific types of results and to motivate\n            individuals for health-related behaviors. Investing in\n            collaboration with a national research team not only\n            strengthens in-country capacity in this technical area, but\n            also contributes greatly to the successful implementation,\n            management and ownership of an evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Community Living Standards Grants\n            or Credit Program

         significant progress in the past decade. The proportion of\n            the population that national household surveys identified as\n            poor decreased slightly from 60 percent in 2000-01 to 57\n            percent in 2005-06. However, because of relatively rapid\n            population growth estimated at 2.7 percent per year and an\n            increase in income inequality, the estimated total number of\n            people living in poverty rose from 4.8 million in 2000-01 to\n            5.4 million in 2005-06. More than 90 percent of the poor\n            live in rural areas, and poverty remains deep and pervasive.\n            The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda\n            has, as its second strategic theme, a reduction in social\n            vulnerability by ensuring that the most vulnerable Rwandans\n            also benefit from growth and by helping Rwanda make further\n            progress in building a more stable society. The objective of\n            the program is to support Government of Rwanda (GoR) social\n            protection and health policy reforms designed to reduce\n            extreme poverty, initially in 30 pilot sectors, and to\n            expand access to high-impact health, nutrition and\n            population interventions at the community level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Second Community
