Moreover, countries at risk by\n            the El Nino type phenomena, should undertake contingency\n            planning, and preventive measures, including routine\n            maintenance, measures which should be incorporated into\n            sectoral regular investment programs, to mitigate adversity,\n            and thus reduce social, and economic losses. The varied\n            impacts of natural disasters, require an individualized\n            approach to project design, hence, decentralized government\n            structures, such as in Bolivia, call for a balance between\n            local governments' responsibilities, and a centralized\n            disaster forecasting, financing, and coordination.\n            Specialized nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) do play a\n            role in the implementation of small-scale projects at the\n            local level, provided implementation, and procurement\n            training for NGOs is granted under emergency donor financed projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -

There are five components. The first\n            consists of flood prevention works, drought mitigation\n            works, and essential equipment such as bailey bridges,\n            temporary power plants, and other equipment needed for\n            managing an emergency response. The second flexibly\n            allocates resources to 1) rehabilitate and rebuild\n            flood-damaged public infrastructure facilities; and 2)\n            regenerate productive capacity in the drought areas by\n            drilling wells, rebuilding small irrigation systems,\n            building earthen dams, and procuring and distributing seeds.\n            The third component provides technical assistance to\n            strengthen the technical operations unit, for sub-project\n            identification and implementation, and for a medium term\n            monitoring and prevention strategy.  The fourth and fifth\n            components consist of a project preparation advance and\n            unallocated funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - El Nino Emergency Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia -
