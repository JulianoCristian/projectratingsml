The\n            project would also support the improvement of forest roads,\n            the construction of forest stations, the replacement,\n            operation and maintenance of vehicles and the provision of\n            specialist staff. The project would increase wood production\n            and reduce pressure on Kenya's fast depleting\n            indigenous forests. It would also lead to public savings in\n            national afforestation programs and prevent disruption of\n            water flow and soils in densely populated areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Third Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Third Forestry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/01/725904/kenya-third-forestry-project","projn":"KE-Forestry III -- P001281","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912560837"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,agricultural\n            land,Agriculture,Audits,bamboo,bark,boxes,catchment,catchment\n            areas,charcoal,commercial banks,community\n            forestry,concession,conifers,Conservator of\n            Forests,cultivation,deforestation,drought,Economic\n            Analysis,environmental\n            protection,erosion,eucalyptus,Expenditures,exploitation,farms,Felling,fiberboard,fibreboard,fishing,Forest,forest\n            cover,Forest Department,forest guards,Forest\n            Industries,forest industry,forest land,forest\n            products,forest reserves,Forest Resources,forest\n            workers,foresters,Forestry,forestry department,forestry\n            operations,forestry program,Forestry Project,FORESTRY\n            PROJECTS,Forestry Research,Forestry\n            Subsector,Fuelwood,furniture,Indigenous forests,kraft\n            paper,labor force,labor productivity,land use,land-use,log\n            extraction,logging,logging equipment,lumber,mechanical\n            pulp,natural forests,natural regeneration,Natural\n            Resources,packaging,Paper\n            Mills,Plantations,planting,plywood,poles,producers,production\n            costs,productivity,Pulp,pulpwood,quality\n            standards,regeneration,roundwood,rural areas,rural\n            workers,savings,sawlogs,Sawmilling,sawmills,sawnwood,silviculture,social\n            forestry,softwood,soil erosion,state forest,state forest\n            areas,timber,timber prices,timber products,timbers,tree\n            nurseries,tree planting,trees,wood,wood market,wood\n            production,wood products,wood-based industries"},"1":{"cdata!":"Afforestation,agricultural\n            land,Agriculture,Audits,bamboo,bark,boxes,catchment,catchment\n            areas,charcoal,commercial banks,community\n            forestry,concession,conifers,Conservator of\n            Forests,cultivation,deforestation,drought,Economic\n            Analysis,environmental\n            protection,erosion,eucalyptus,Expenditures,exploitation,farms,Felling,fiberboard,fibreboard,fishing,Forest,forest\n            cover,Forest Department,forest guards,Forest\n            Industries,forest industry,forest land,forest\n            products,forest reserves,Forest Resources,forest\n            workers,foresters,Forestry,forestry department,forestry\n            operations,forestry program,Forestry Project,FORESTRY\n            PROJECTS,Forestry Research,Forestry\n            Subsector,Fuelwood,furniture,Indigenous forests,kraft\n            paper,labor force,labor productivity,land use,land-use,log\n            extraction,logging,logging equipment,lumber,mechanical\n            pulp,natural forests,natural regeneration,Natural\n            Resources,packaging,Paper\n            Mills,Plantations,planting,plywood,poles,producers,production\n            costs,productivity,Pulp,pulpwood,quality\n            standards,regeneration,roundwood,rural areas,rural\n            workers,savings,sawlogs,Sawmilling,sawmills,sawnwood,silviculture,social\n            forestry,softwood,soil erosion,state forest,state forest\n            areas,timber,timber prices,timber products,timbers,tree\n            nurseries,tree planting,trees,wood,wood market,wood\n            production,wood products,wood-based industries"}},"owner":"WB Off: Nairobi - Eastern AFR 2 (AFCE2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"3614"},"facets":{}}}
