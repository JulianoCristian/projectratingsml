The key lessons\n            call, primarily, for flexibility in project design,\n            particularly for emergency operations, for, although a\n            flexible approach was followed in financing certain items,\n            allowing a quick response to emergency needs, there were\n            nonetheless, difficulties in securing donor financing, which\n            caused implementation delays in the second phase of the\n            project, with further delays in disbursements of the Trust\n            fund Credit, also because of lack of available financing.\n            This indicates that, in the absence of co-financing\n            commitments, project components would better remain\n            independent, and viable on their own, considering the\n            importance of a timely closure in an emergency project.\n            Advance mechanisms for emergency operations are critical, as\n            demonstrated by the difficulties experienced in handling\n            transfers, and adjustment disbursements, through the Project\n            Start-Up Advances.

The project will enhance\n            energy efficiency and energy conservation and reduce\n            environmental pollution by enabling disconnection of about\n            34,000 flats in Sarajevo from self-made gas connections. The\n            project consists of the following major components: 1) a\n            technical assistance component, especially needed for: (a)\n            project management; (b) engineering; (c) financial and\n            commercial management; and (d) system planning; and 2) a\n            reconstruction component which includes: (a) boilers; (b)\n            distribution network; (c) substations; (d) remote control\n            center; (e) internal building installations; and (f)\n            metering. In Sarajevo, the major components will be: 1)\n            technical assistance which will be used for project\n            management, including an engineering survey and assessment,\n            and for staff training, master plan and tariff studies; and\n            2) investments for the reconstruction all of parts of the\n            district heating network, including building internals. In\n            Banja Luka, technical assitance will be used for project\n            preparation (engineering survey and assessment) only."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency
