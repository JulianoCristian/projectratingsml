At the local level, this component funds\n            sub-projects which may support reforming in-service teacher\n            education programs, creating/strengthening education demand\n            through targeted information campaigns, creating incentive\n            schemes to increase school coverage, and implementing\n            projects linking school learning with productivity.

The\n            third component supports the ministry's role in\n            reinforcing participatory and democratic forms of school\n            governance and developing social capital and civic
