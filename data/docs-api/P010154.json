Both\n            projects suffered a number of shortcomings, from design\n            through implementation. The project period was set too short\n            to implement complex institution-building projects and\n            phasing of substantial construction programs was\n            unrealistic. Little attention was paid to the availability\n            of suitably qualified technical staff and lines of command\n            were not clearly delineated. Administrative and budgetary\n            problems were not properly identified, the availability of\n            relevant technology was ill-assessed, and farmers did not\n            participate in the identification and prioritizing of their\n            perceived problems and needs. Several key lessons can be\n            learned from these projects. First, during the initial years\n            of an extension project, little more can be achieved than\n            the establishment of an administrative framework. Second, a\n            single line of command has to be maintained and management\n            performance monitored in systems operation. Third, a\n            bottom-up approach to extension and research is essential.\n            Fourth, staff have to be provided with adequate incentives\n            to ensure motivation and staff continuity. Lastly, staff\n            recruitment procedures and training require adequate\n            standards to ensure staff quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Agricultural Extension and Food\n

improvement in agricultural production,\n            particularly foodgrains, in eight of the twenty\n            administrative districts of the Nepal Terai. Improvements in\n            production will be brought about by the wide adoption of low\n            cost, labor-intensive agricultural practices, improved\n            varieties of seeds, and provision of fertilizer. The project\n            will comprise: (a) reorganization and strengthening of\n            agricultural extension services; (b) strengthening and\n            reorientation of applied and adaptive research; (c)\n            strengthening the coordination between research and\n            extension services; (d) establishment of regular monitoring\n            and evaluation procedures; (e) local and overseas training\n            of staff, studies and provision of consultants; (f)\n            establishment of regional training centers, and offices and\n            housing for field
