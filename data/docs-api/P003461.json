The objectives of RC III were: (a) to stimulate\n            growth and diversification of agriculture by expanding the\n            availability of medium- and long-term credit; and (b) to\n            increase the operational efficiency of Agricultural Bank of\n            China (ABC) through institutional development. The\n            Bank's performance in identification, preparation and\n            appraisal was satisfactory. The project's outcome is\n            viewed as satisfactory, since the first and most important\n            objective of agricultural growth and diversification was\n            achieved with a relatively high degree of sustainability.\n            The project is not viewed as highly satisfactory because (a)\n            the level of technology transfer in the lending program was\n            minimal, and (b) the second objective of capacity building\n            was only partially realized and its sustainability is\n            uncertain. The key lessons learned from the project include\n            the following. First, future operations should be based on a\n            realistic assessment of Government capacity and commitment\n            for sector reform. Second, the tight phasing of four ABC\n            projects within seven years was not conducive to effective\n            implementation of RC 111. Third, ABC's institutional\n            development requirements are much greater than the limited\n            technical assistance program supported under RC III. Fourth,\n            despite ABC's improved performance in the appraisal of\n            sub-projects, additional capacity building is required in\n            the area of economic and marketing issues. Fifth, future\n            operations need to strengthen incentives for the transfer of\n            new technologies and compliance with pollution control\n            regulations in sub-project selection and design. Sixth, the\n            development of an effective management information system is\n            a high priority. Seventh, ABC's institutional capacity\n            for supervision must be strengthened, including the\n            appointment of additional staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Third Rural Credit
