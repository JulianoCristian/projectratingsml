Lessons learned: difficult\n            policy and institutional reforms, of the scope of WATSAL,\n            require four conditions to be fulfilled. WATSAL provided\n            balance-of-payments support against a negative list of\n            expenditures instead of providing import support based on a\n            positive list of eligible, sector-related imports as is more\n            common for sector adjustment operations. Piloting of\n            controversial or complex aspects of a reform program, prior\n            to or during the loan period creates confidence and\n            generates political support. From the perspective of Loan\n            Performance, enactment of a law should be avoided, if\n            possible, as common sense suggests. In the WATSAL case, the\n            drafting of the law and the regulations was undertaken by an\n            inter-agency and multi-disciplinary Task Force having NGO\n            representation. For a major reform program, funding is\n            needed for Task Force expenses. A multi-tranche sector\n            reform takes time and requires higher than average Bank\n            funding for supervision, and for communication and translations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

Adjustment Loan describes the\n            risks associated with Indonesia's policy reforms\n            regarding water management, and it proposes mitigation\n            options. The lack of transparency and accountability will be\n            offset by encouraging nongovernmental organizations to act\n            as permanent advisory members to the national apex body that\n            will be established to address the overall weakness in\n            implementing environmental regulations. The participation of\n            stakeholders will also be increased through strengthening\n            provincial and river basin water resources management\n            agencies, committees, and units. To address water pollution,\n            particularly urban pollution from household waste and\n            agricultural chemicals, long-term programs of institutional\n            and infrastructure development and training and promotion\n            programs (e.g., integrated pest management and frequent\n            media campaigns) will be installed. To allay concerns about\n            the capacity of water users' associations to handle\n            irrigation reform and the transfer of secondary canals, and\n            about the varying patterns of community leadership between\n            the regions, a recommendation was made to phase in these\n            responsibilities while continuously reviewing and revising\n            the
