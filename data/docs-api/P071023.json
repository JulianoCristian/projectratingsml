Some lessons learned included: the\n            Bank and Government should be realistic about the risk of\n            procurement delays at the outset to avoid administratively\n            costly extensions or squeezing the timeframe for\n            implementation. The Government and Bank should extend\n            projects if there is a reasonable chance of increasing the\n            developmental impact. The Bank should be realistic about the\n            risks related to designing financial sector projects that\n            target only a few banks. Monitoring and evaluation\n            indicators must be sufficiently demanding if they are to\n            serve as useful tools for a project. For a successful\n            privatization, government must maintain a commitment to a\n            controlled and transparent privatization process. The\n            savings bank privatization in Mongolia demonstrated the\n            well-known lesson that the most important factor affecting\n            outcome is not the government's development of a good\n            action plan, but the Government's commitment to fully\n            implement the plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Financial Capacity Development

There are three\n            project components. First, the Commercial Bank Risk\n            Management component assists the participating banks in\n            re-engineering their lending process and creating a strong\n            credit culture. It will enhance the effectiveness of\n            commercial banks' credit risk management and\n            cxompliance with Bank of Mongolia regulations and\n            international banking practices. For each of the three\n            selected banks, an international specialist will be retained\n            to work full time in a senior management position;\n            allocations will also be made for short-term staff\n            secondment in foreign commercial banks and risk management\n            systems upgrading. Second, the payents systems modernization\n            component assures the availability of an appropriate set of\n            cost-effective payments systems and payments instruments\n            that satisfy the evolving needs of all sectors of the\n            economy with particular emphasis on the needs of government,\n            business, and individual consumers to make and receive\n            non-cash payments. Third, the Savings Bank Resolution\n            component assists the governemtn to develop and implement a\n            carefully managed divestiture process of the Savings Bank,\n            to diversify systemic risks and reduce government subsidies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Financial Capacity Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Financial Capacity\n
