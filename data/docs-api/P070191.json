Some lessons\n            learned included: to achieve significant sustainable impact\n            of environmental infrastructure improvements and addressing\n            complex policy issues in a major city, strategic planning,\n            consistency in implementation, and time for evolution is\n            required. Early project implementation demonstrated the\n            importance of doing site visits as part of feasibility\n            studies/design to prevent unforeseen complications\n            (surprises) on the ground at implementation stage. The\n            deletion of one sub-component in the project is a reminder\n            that in situations where there is a risk of significant\n            delay in loan negotiation or effectiveness, it may be more\n            effective for a borrower to exclude very urgent investments\n            from the project scope and instead implement them with other\n            funding, if possible. At locations where traffic impacts\n            were significant, the contractors were required to use\n            pipe-jacking techniques to alleviate traffic problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

support the implementation of urban environment goal\n            of the country's development strategy, and thereby help\n            ensure that economic growth takes place in an\n            environmentally, and institutionally sustainable manner,\n            developing innovative policies, institutional reforms, and\n            financing methods. Project components address: 1)\n            Shanghai's wastewater management, by financing both\n            collection, trunk sewers, pumping stations, wastewater\n            treatment plants, as well as outfall and sludge treatment\n            methods. Collection systems will include either separate\n            wastewater and storm-water collection systems, or combined\n            wastewater systems, that would include a main conveyor to\n            the treatment plant, incorporating full secondary treatment\n            of effluents discharged through existing outfalls, while\n            sludge, and solid wastes will be disposed at selected\n            landfills; 2) urban solid waste management, to establish\n            environmentally cost-effective municipal solid waste\n            management services in urban areas, by adopting user tariffs\n            to ensure cost recovery of municipal services, as well as\n            adopting a market-oriented institutional arrangement for the\n            provision of municipal solid waste management services. On a\n            pilot basis, a set of administrative, and economic\n            market-based instruments to support waste recycling, will be\n            introduced; 3) urban planning, and pilot upgrading, will\n            assist in the planning for institutional, and administrative\n            frameworks, focused on the planning, construction, and\n            management goals for urban infrastructure improvements,\n            implemented in a three-phase adaptable program lending; 4)\n            the Upper Huangpu River catchment environmental management,\n            to improve its environmental management, and protection of\n            its water resources. To this end, support to policy\n            development, and physical investments will be provided ,\n            comprising data collection, analysis of pollution sources,\n            developing policy and investment strategies; and, 5)\n            institutional strengthening, and training, by supporting a\n            range of technical assistance, and capacity building\n

Cleaning up\n            the site, refilling the topsoil, and collecting manure and\n            using fertilization will alleviate soil infertility.\n            Temporary ditches will be built to control problems caused\n            by destroyed irrigation and drainage works.

A sand\n            sink pool will alleviate river pollution.

Waste will be disposed of according to a\n            disposal plan and will be prevented from release onto\n            farmland or into rivers, channel ponds, etc. Waste will be\n            used to

(options 1 and 2), the\n            Fengxian waste water treatment works, and the Old City\n            Community Protection, contained in five volumes. The\n            objectives of the RAP are to improve, or at least restore\n            living conditions of the project affected people (PAP),\n            including their prevailing income levels, and, provide\n            vulnerable groups with preferential policies in housing, and\n            employment opportunities. Land, and/or housing compensation\n            will be in the form of either cash (based on real estate\n            market values), or relocation based on equal value for the\n            exchange of property housing. Leased residential housing\n            will be negotiated based on a rental amount formula, while\n            public-owned leased housing will be at the Government\n            regulated rental rate. Non-residential housing, businesses,\n            and equipment losses will be compensated at replacement\n            costs, with special considerations for equipment\n            depreciation, while compensation for business income losses\n            shall be in accordance with standard regulations. In\n            addition, construction companies should provide assistance\n            in land preparation, in accessing credit, and in providing\n            training assistance for new job opportunities. Vulnerable\n            groups will be assisted to improve their living conditions,\n            while involuntary resettlement will be regarded as an\n            integral part of project implementation.

Waste will be disposed of according to a\n            disposal plan and will be prevented from release onto\n            farmland or into rivers, channel ponds, etc. Waste will be\n            used to
