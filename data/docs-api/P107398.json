Some\n            lessons learned included: the participation of several\n            donors in a multi-year program for budget support can\n            increase the level of resources and focus them on a common\n            objective but this arrangement is more vulnerable to annual\n            changes in donor priorities and requires timely\n            communication and coordination. The sequential donor\n            financing of programmatic budget support is inherently more\n            risky than co-financing of a single annual operation because\n            planned resource allocations may change by the time the\n            donor's annual program for a given country is approved.\n            And this risk seems likely to have increased with the global\n            economic downturn and shifting resource priorities.\n            Measurable performance indicators aligned with the capacity\n            of the Borrower are necessary but not sufficient elements of\n            timely, effective Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). It\n            needs to be accompanied by a clear delineation of reporting\n            responsibilities. The program document also specifies that\n            even after disbursement of its single tranche, the Bank was\n            to continue participating in annual reviews of the program.\n            These reviews were to monitor reform actions, evaluate the\n            impact of the reforms on the development objectives, and\n            discuss strategic adjustments to the policy matrix taking\n            into account the latest country developments, stakeholder\n            support and alternative options for realizing the intended\n            development

       Reform and Growth Grant Project in Gambia are to strengthen\n            the government's capacity to use public resources and\n            improve the management o f the groundnut sector. The\n            International Development Association (IDA) grant supports\n            the implementation of a subset of reforms in the\n            government's policy matrix in 2008 and 2009. These\n            reform measures are also the prior actions for the\n            disbursement of IDA's single tranche. There are several\n            reasons for the coordination arrangement. Despite being a\n            single tranche, it allows the Bank to support critical\n            poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) reforms which can\n            only be implemented over the medium term and extends the\n            Bank's engagement in the policy dialogue beyond the\n            first year of implementation. It also improves donor\n            coordination, reduces the government's transaction\n            costs and allows IDA to leverage its limited resources\n            across a range of critical policy reforms. The arrangement\n            is consistent with and endorsed in the Bank's FY08-11\n            Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) prepared jointly with the\n            African Development Bank (AfDB). It is in line with the aid\n            effectiveness agenda of the development community."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia - Public Sector Reform and Growth\n            Grant
