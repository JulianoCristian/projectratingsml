Some lessons\n            learned include: strong sector analysis is a prerequisite to\n            good project design. The SWMP was conceived after what\n            appears to be careful consideration of the needs and\n            possibilities of the SWM sector. While there was an\n            (European Union) EU-funded (National strategy to draw on,\n            key lessons of experience as well as close attention to the\n            political realities of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) helped\n            shape SWMP. Post-conflict situations are challenging but can\n            also present opportunities. A gradual approach to reforms\n            may be appropriate in difficult political environments or\n            new sector engagements. The SWMP is a great example of\n            building a phased approach to improving service delivery in\n            a country with a challenging political environment and where\n            solid waste services were not developed. Client ownership\n            matters greatly. While this lesson is widely disseminated\n            within the Bank, its practical application in the case of\n            the SWMP was critical to the Project's success.\n            Transparency in eligibility criteria for participation in\n            the SWMP created a positive incentive for municipalities.\n            The Project started with three regions that had met\n            eligibility criteria for receiving investments. Ensure that\n            risk mitigation measures are more than a hoped for outcome.\n            Many key risks were correctly identified during Project\n            preparation. However, the effectiveness of mitigation\n            measures was in some instances perhaps considered in an\n            optimistic light. Stability in task management can help\n            project implementation. A key ingredient in the\n            Project's success has been the dedicated effort of both\n            the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the Bank team."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -
