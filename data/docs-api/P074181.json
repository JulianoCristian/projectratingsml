As a result, growth\n            accelerated and public finances improved, with public debt\n            in 2006 at 48 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down\n            from 78 percent. Poverty rates declined sharply. Yet,\n            sustained progress was threatened by challenges in reforming\n            public finances, and outdated regulations hindered\n            investments. Unemployment remained high, and the labor\n            market was largely unskilled. The sharp  deterioration in\n            the global economy in 2008 added to these challenges. The\n            first Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development\n            Policy Loan (REGE DPL 1) in 2010 streamlined World Bank\n            support to Turkey at a critical time when unemployment was\n            16 percent and GDP had contracted by 4.7 percent. The second\n            Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy\n            Loan (REGE DPL 2) supports ongoing reforms of public\n            finances, commercial law, and civil procedures. Turkey has\n            reached almost universal health insurance coverage, enrolled\n            more children in pre-school, and dramatically increased\n            vocational training. These ongoing reforms are expected to\n            reduce poverty and inequality in Turkey over the long run."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sustaining growth with jobs and better\n            services in

Borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: some\n            political difficulties at the time of CEDPL inception and\n            negotiations may have called for a postponement of program\n            negotiations, but looking in retrospect the decision to go\n            ahead was appropriate. It was well supported: a) policy\n            actions-all prior actions-constituted good public policy and\n            were technically and politically difficult reforms; b) these\n            policies were (and still are) difficult to reverse; and c)\n            clearly the relationship with the Government will have been\n            unnecessarily strained if a postponement had taken place,\n            particularly as the Bank had already publicly expressed\n            support for these reforms. The approval of a follow-on\n            operation supporting additional policy actions under the\n            Government's Ninth Development Plan (NDP) validates\n            this conclusion. Long time relationship with the country\n            provides a good deal of knowledge and experience which has\n            been taken into account when discussing with the\n            authorities, designing the operation, and conducting its\n            supervision. Establishing targets for indicators as specific\n            as possible is of first order to monitor the program. The\n            program matrix does provide a list of program outcomes and\n            monitoring indicators. Many indicators are amenable to\n            practical monitoring only at the end of the program. To the\n            extent possible, targets should be stated more explicit in\n            the program document."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Competitiveness and Employment\n            Development
