rights and complimentary\n            policies that enable transactions to be made with security\n            and efficiency. This paper proposes an extension of the\n            closing date until June 30, 2012. There are no changes to\n            the project development objective, environmental assessment\n            (EA) category, outcomes or the results monitoring framework.\n            The project is currently rated as satisfactory and most\n            project outcomes and targets have been met. The request for\n            this change has been made by the Government in their letter\n            dated February 16, 2012. The aide memoire and the management\n            letter from the World Bank November 2011 mission recommended\n            the extension in order to bridge the gap between the LRP and\n            the Real Estate Registration Project (RERP) currently under\n            preparation and to allow for the completion of all LRP\n            project activities.

The request for\n            this change has been made by the Government in their letter\n            dated February 16, 2012. The aide memoire and the management\n            letter from the World Bank November 2011 mission recommended\n            the extension in order to bridge the gap between the LRP and\n            the Real Estate Registration Project (RERP) currently under\n            preparation and to allow for the completion of all LRP\n            project activities.
