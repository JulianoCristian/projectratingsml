The project achieved all its objectives. The\n            lessons drawn from this project are: 1) timely intervention\n            by provision of technical and financial assistance to a\n            program greatly facilitates implementation of a program as\n            the technical assistance makes acquisition of critical\n            expertise and procurement of necessary equipment, vehicles,\n            and training possible; 2) establishment of new institutions\n            can take longer than is expected; 3) careful selection of\n            key management staff can make a difference between success\n            and failure of a program and so is stability of staff in a\n            project; and 4) beneficiaries of a project should be\n            involved in pre-assistance identification of activities to\n            be performed as this facilitates quick implementation of a\n            project/program and improves sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Privatization and Industrial Reform\n
