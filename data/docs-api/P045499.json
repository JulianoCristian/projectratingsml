Some lessons\n            learned included: integrated management of irrigation and\n            drainage (I and D) on sound institutional and financial\n            arrangements should not be left as an unresolved issue. This\n            requires the support of the ministry of water resources and\n            irrigation (MWRI) and all the institutions in the sector,\n            not only the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects\n            (EPADP). Project design should be realistic and appropriate\n            to the institutional capacity of the client, taking into\n            consideration the qualifications and skills of the staff.\n            Capacity building and institutional support if considered\n            important and reflected in the objectives should also be\n            reflected in the key performance indicators even if mainly\n            financed through parallel means. Training provided on\n            procurement and contract management should be sufficient and\n            conducted regularly for the client staff, particularly\n            considering the high turnover of staff. Complete the\n            tendering process as early as possible, particularly toward\n            the end of the project, to have enough time to complete the\n            tendering and bidding requirements on time and to re-tender\n            in case of failure due to some reasons. Supervision should\n            be more proactive toward the implementation of the\n            nonstructural components of the project, especially those\n            activities aiming at institutional development of the\n            implementing agency. The private sector should be engaged\n            and fears of monopolies and financial risks should be\n            analyzed and appropriate regulatory measures proposed,\n            including risk sharing by both the government and the\n            private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -
