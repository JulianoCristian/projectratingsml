The World Bank has responded\n            to this development challenge with multiple roads projects,\n            including a United States (U.S.) 29 million dollars\n            investment in road safety programs in 1997-2006 under the\n            roads second project and the road maintenance and\n            rehabilitation project. About 600 people from Poland's\n            16 regions went through a five-day course developed under a\n            World Bank contract. The World Bank provided crucial\n            consultancy that helped things happen on the ground outside\n            the usual administrative channels, to make a difference and\n            save people's lives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Making roads safer for all"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Making roads safer for all"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/08/23974611/poland-making-roads-safer-all","count":"Poland","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"black spots, bus, car, cars, concrete,\n            crashes, drivers, driving, fatalities, income, injuries,\n            intersection, intersections, investment in road safety,\n            investment in road safety programs, Ministry of Transport,\n            National Road Safety, National Road Safety Council, national\n            roads, passenger, pedestrians, policemen, radio, regional\n            roads, Road, Road improvement, road maintenance, Road\n            safety, road safety awareness, road safety programs, Roads,\n            rural roads, safer roads, safety campaigns, Safety Program,\n            severity of road crashes, signs, traffic, traffic\n            casualties, traffic safety"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Rural development,Urban development,Public sector governance","topic":"Roads and Highways m1327398 168,Transport Infrastructure m1327632 1803,Transport Safety m1326238 1808,Road Safety m1326123 1429,Road Transport m1327629 1801","projn":"PL-Road Maintenance & Rehabilitation\n            Project -- P078170,PL-Roads 2 Project-118517 -- P008593","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Roads & Transport,Transport in Urban Areas,Roads & Highways,Road Safety,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Rural Development,Transport,Urban Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150209132735"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Central government administration","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Infrastructure services for private sector development","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Transport,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Roads and Highways m1327398 168,Transport Infrastructure m1327632 1803,Transport Safety m1326238 1808,Road Safety m1326123 1429,Road Transport m1327629 1801","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["A","F"],"trustfund":"TF021141-EC METAP-ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"repnb":"92489"},"6803735":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/04/6803735/poland-second-roads-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2006/04/6803735/poland-second-roads-project","new_url":"2006/04/6803735/poland-second-roads-project","disclosure_date":"2006-06-05T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/05/22/000012009_20060522085526/Rendered/INDEX/309890rev0pdf.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/05/22/000012009_20060522085526/Rendered/PDF/309890rev0pdf.pdf","loan_no":"4236","docdt":"2006-04-25T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2006-05-22T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Gray cover","versiontyp_key":"1309938","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Poland - Second Roads Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings convey a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, and substantial\n            institutional development impacts.

and speed up the\n            modernization of the road sector according to the policy\n            initiated by Poland under the First Roads Project. The\n            project components cover the three main areas (policy,\n            institutional, and physical investments) of Poland's\n            1996-2000 Road Investment Program (RIP). The first\n            component, policy, comprises 1) adequate maintenance and\n            strengthening of high priority roads, including bridges, and\n            winter maintenance, with adequate budgets; 2) review and\n            adjustment of road user charge levels and distribution\n            between different user groups to balance costs and revenues;\n            3) further action on the road axle-load policy; and 4)\n            establishment of a leasing policy to enhance and speed up\n            privatization of local contractors. The second component\n            calls for: 1) further restructuring, privatization, and\n            development of the road contracting industry, focusing on\n            improving managerial, financial and technical capacity, and\n            in establishing professional associations to enhance their\n            competitiveness; 2) improving the coordination,\n            collaboration, and operation of government agencies on the\n            ongoing road safety program; and 3) assisting the vehicle\n            inspection center. The third component, infrastructure,\n            consists of: 1) rebuilding, upgrading, realigning, and\n            resurfacing priority road sections and their crossings\n            through cities; 2) rebuilding and upgrading 2 bridges, and\n            building 3 new major bridges; 3) constructing 12 bypasses\n            around congested cities; 4) emergency reconstruction of\n            flood-damaged high priority infrastructure; 5) acquiring\n            road maintenance and road safety equipment, vehicles, and\n            materials; and 6) technical assistance and training for the\n            ongoing road safety program in management, planning,\n            pavement and maintenance systems, environmental protection,\n            modern design and construction techniques,

bridges for river\n            crossings.  Less than 20 people will be relocated, and a\n            resettlement package has been provided.  This environmental\n            assessment studied the impacts for three stages:\n            construction of camp, during road construction, and after\n            construction.  At the first stage, construction of camp\n            sites away from vegetated areas will reduce vegetation\n            destruction.  Good practice will be adopted to avoid\n            oil-grease spillage and recycling will be pursued.  Asphalt\n            plant will be located at leeward edge of the camp to reduce\n            air and sound pollutions.  Measures to tackle waste disposal\n            and poor sanitation include source separation of garbage and\n            use of organic materials as compost.  At the second stage,\n            landscape disfiguration can be mitigated by road side\n            plantation of trees and gentle slopes at cut and fill\n            sections.  Drainage works stabilized with retaining\n            structures will be provided to prevent landslides.  There\n            will be pollution control for construction equipment and\n            precautionary measures during blasting at quarries.  Ditches\n            will be built to reduce interference with surface drainage.\n            Channeled water flow will reduce erosion of road embankment.\n            Controlled withdrawal of water from deep aquifer will retain\n            sub-soil water table.  Drainage facilities will be used to\n            reduce surface and ground water at the third stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Roads II Project : environmental\n            assessment executive
