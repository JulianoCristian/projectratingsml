establishment and\n            expansion of industrial enterprises of all sizes with the\n            exception of cottage industries. About $50 million of the\n            proposed loan would be earmarked for large-scale enterprises\n            and $29.7 million for small- and medium-scale industry. In\n            addition, about $300,000 would be used by DBP to establish a\n            development banking institute to train the management and\n            personnel of smaller development finance institutions. In\n            addition to providing the resources required for expanding\n            the industrial base of the Philippines, the project would\n            help in further improving the institutional capacity of DBP.\n            There are a number of financial and industrial sector issues\n            which the Government would need to address within the next\n            few years. The degree of success of the Government in\n            addressing these issues would have a significant effect on\n            the development impact of DBP's industrial lending."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Third Industrial Investment\n            Credit (Development Bank) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Third Industrial\n            Investment Credit (Development Bank) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/04/726865/philippines-third-industrial-investment-credit-development-bank-project","projn":"PH-Dfc-Dbp III -- P004459","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Municipal Financial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912385879"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agriculture,Assets,Balance\n            Sheets,banking sector,Basic metals,book value,capital\n            employed,Capital expenditures,capital goods,Central\n            Bank,coal,collateral,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,current prices,Debt,depreciation,depreciation\n            allowances,Development Banking,Development Banks,Development\n            Strategy,Economic Development,Economic Impact,Economic Rate\n            of Return,economies of scale,electricity\n            generation,employment,entrepreneurship,exchange rate,export\n            processing zones,exports,feasibility studies,Financial\n            Institutions,Financial Markets,Financial\n            Performance,FINANCIAL SECTOR,fiscal policies,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Fisheries,fixed assets,Foreign Currency,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,gross value,growth\n            rate,Housing,imports,incentive framework,Income\n            Statements,Interest income,Interest Rates,Intermediate\n            Goods,inventories,labor force,labor productivity,Legal\n            Framework,metals,natural resources,new\n            entrants,onlending,Portfolio,Productivity,Real estate\n            loans,Rural Banks,Securities,Small Business,Technical\n            Assistance,thrift institutions,Transport,value added,wage\n            rates,wages,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agriculture,Assets,Balance\n            Sheets,banking sector,Basic metals,book value,capital\n            employed,Capital expenditures,capital goods,Central\n            Bank,coal,collateral,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,current prices,Debt,depreciation,depreciation\n            allowances,Development Banking,Development Banks,Development\n            Strategy,Economic Development,Economic Impact,Economic Rate\n            of Return,economies of scale,electricity\n            generation,employment,entrepreneurship,exchange rate,export\n            processing zones,exports,feasibility studies,Financial\n            Institutions,Financial Markets,Financial\n            Performance,FINANCIAL SECTOR,fiscal policies,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Fisheries,fixed assets,Foreign Currency,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,gross value,growth\n            rate,Housing,imports,incentive framework,Income\n            Statements,Interest income,Interest Rates,Intermediate\n            Goods,inventories,labor force,labor productivity,Legal\n            Framework,metals,natural resources,new\n            entrants,onlending,Portfolio,Productivity,Real estate\n            loans,Rural Banks,Securities,Small Business,Technical\n            Assistance,thrift institutions,Transport,value added,wage\n            rates,wages,working capital"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"1972"},"facets":{}}}
