potential environmental and social\n            safeguard issues arising in the use of fiscal transfers to\n            union Parishads in the Bangladesh Local Governance Support\n            Project for Community Infrastructure Works (CIWs). To avoid\n            any potential adverse impact all prospective CIWs will be\n            screened, and to decrease potential negative adaptations\n            will be made in design, location, or execution; cumulative\n            impacts will be prevented or mitigated, positive impacts\n            will be enhanced, and added stress on environmentally\n            sensitive areas will be avoided. The project will exclude\n            CIWs which may cause the following environmental impacts:\n            works that close gaps or culverts in existing roads, which\n            may affect water flow; tube-wells with arsenic contamination\n            higher than the national standard or based below the 10-year\n            flood level; water supply schemes with a high probability of\n            bacterial contamination or characteristics which may make\n            water unsuitable for drinking; health facilities without\n            adequate hazardous waste management capacity; new or\n            significant expansion of disposal facilities with negative\n            health impacts to nearby water sources or population, or of\n            disposal sites requiring involuntary public participation;\n            building or repairing mechanized tube-wells for irrigation\n            in deep aquifers leading to aquifer depletion or seasonal\n            dams with adverse downstream effects; draining traditional\n            wetlands for agricultural use; subprojects requiring\n            pesticides; and activities supporting commercial logging in\n            forested areas, or using unsustainable, harvested timber or\n            fuelwood, or involving significant conversion or degradation\n            of critical natural habitats. Also, CIWs that involve\n            involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous peoples with\n            long-term consequences will be ineligible for support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Local Governance Support\n            Project : environmental and social management framework"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Local Governance\n            Support Project : environmental and social management framework"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/04/6731302/bangladesh-local-governance-support-project-environmental-social-management-framework","projn":"BD-Local Governance Support Project -- P098273","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Public Sector Expenditure Policy,National Governance,Social Accountability,Civil Society,Environmental Governance,Governance Indicators","teratopic":"Environment,Public Sector Development,Governance,Social Development","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060417173639"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Public Sector Development,Governance,Social Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information, accountability,\n            administrative capacity, annual budget, annual budget cycle,\n            annual report, auditing, Auditor General, auditors,\n            authority, Authorization, basic service provision, basic\n            services, block grants, budget framework, capacity building,\n            capacity building activities, capacity development, central\n            authority, central government, citizens, civic engagement,\n            civil society, civil society actors, Community Driven\n            Development, community mobilization, community\n            participation, consensus, constituencies, contributions,\n            decentralization, decentralization process, decentralization\n            reforms, decision-making, decision-making processes,\n            disclosure, districts, economic performance, execution,\n            expenditure, expenditures, fiduciary safeguards, financial\n            assurance, financial situation, financial statements,\n            financial support, fiscal capacity, Fiscal sustainability,\n            Fiscal transfers, good governance, governance reforms,\n            government administration, government agencies, government\n            level, government levels, Indigenous Peoples, institution\n            building, institutional capacity, Institutional Development,\n            institutional support, institutionalization,\n            intergovernmental fiscal framework, INTERNATIONAL\n            DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION,\n            Involuntary Resettlement, lack of clarity, local\n            accountability, Local Governance, Local Government, local\n            government capacity, local governments, local public\n            services, local revenue, Members of Parliament, mid-course\n            corrections, Ministry of Finance, mobilization, Municipal\n            Services, national governance, national government, national\n            level, national policy, national service, participatory\n            governance, participatory process, performance assessment,\n            performance criteria, Performance Indicators, performance\n            review, policy analysis, policy development, policy\n            dialogue, political competition, Poverty Reduction, Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy, poverty-reducing programs, preparation,\n            programs, project implementation, public consultation,\n            Public Expenditure, Public Expenditure Management, Public\n            sector, Public sector governance, public spending, quality\n            assurance, reform process, resource allocation, revenue\n            administration, revenue collection, service delivery,\n            service delivery systems, service provision, Social\n            Investment, Social Investment Project, social protection,\n            social ?audits, Sustainability of reforms, total public\n            spending, training programs, transparency, transparent\n            mechanisms, uncertainty, vested interests, village"}},"owner":"Environment & Water Resources (SASDI)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"E1389"},"facets":{}}}
