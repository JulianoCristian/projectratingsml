Technical assistance in\n            support of politically difficult transition reforms have a\n            higher chance of success if designed as an integral part of\n            Bank's broader sector assistance strategy. The\n            implementation of a complex and politically sensitive\n            Technical Assistance (TA) program does not only require a\n            fully functioning implementing agency, but also constant\n            support at the level of senior policy-making. The effective\n            coordination by the Bank of technical assistance provided by\n            bilateral donors can be a critical factor in quickly\n            developing the institutional capacity to implement high\n            impact reforms. Flexibility built into the TA operations is\n            essential when dealing with rapidly evolving operational\n            environment.
