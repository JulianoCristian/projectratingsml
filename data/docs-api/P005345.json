The Emergency\n            Project focused on essential repairs of physical and social\n            infrastructure in various sectors (power, water and\n            sanitation, solid waste, education, housing, etc.) while\n            paving the way for future sector reforms. The project\n            achieved most of its physical objectives, particularly in\n            the power and water and sanitation sectors, but was less\n            successful in the implementation of basic sector reforms.\n            Overall the project outcome is rated as satisfactory. The\n            Solid Waste Project\u0092s objective to provide solid waste\n            collection and treatment facilities for the whole country\n            was overly ambitious. At completion, only one of the 15\n            sanitary landfills planned was completed. The project almost\n            totally failed to achieve its objectives, and its outcome is\n            rated as unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from this\n            assessment included: government efforts remain concentrated\n            on slowly expanding infrastructure for water supply, solid\n            waste management and electricity and less on sector reform,\n            although there were notable achievements in the Ministry of\n            Finance and Telecommunications. Institutional issues\n            requiring cross-sectoral coordination have made little\n            progress. Attention to improving cost recovery, demand\n            management and environmental conservation has languished as\n            government continues to subsidize the delivery of basic\n            services on response to political pressure. What little\n            attention there was to long-range planning, conservation,\n            trade-offs, and efficiency improvements has become hostage\n            to the uncertain political climate and inability to bridge\n            sectarian differences for the common good. The most recent\n            34-day war between Hezbollah and Israeli starting July 2006\n            underscores the tremendous governance challenges in Lebanon\n            in which political authority is diffused, by design, among\n            various sects and branches of government. The continued\n            importance of sustainable natural resource and environmental\n            management is recognized by the Bank and forms the third\n            pillar of the 2006 country assistance strategy (CAS). And it\n            is likely, as before, that essential institutional\n            strengthening and reform in the primary water supply,\n            sanitation, solid waste and electricity service sectors will\n            be sidelined in the new national reconstruction program\n            following the July 2006 war. As a national consensus on\n            solid waste management seems unlikely in the short to medium\n            term, the Bank may consider supporting additional pilot\n            projects and private sector participation (PPP) in the\n            sector to overcome the information asymmetry that thwarts a\n            consensus on how to proceed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - Emergency Reconstruction and\n            Rehabilitation and Solid Waste and Environmental Managment Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - Emergency\n            Reconstruction and Rehabilitation and Solid Waste and\n            Environmental Managment Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/9360993/lebanon-emergency-reconstruction-rehabilitation-solid-waste-environmental-managment-projects","count":"Lebanon","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"air pollution, average costs, Coastal Zone\n            Management, Coastal zones, common good, compactor trucks,\n            compost, compost marketing, compost plant, compost plants,\n            composting, composting plants, debt, diffusion,\n            disinfection, disposal facilities, disposal method, disposal\n            option, disposal services, disposal site, disposal sites,\n            distribution systems, dump sites, dumpsite, economic growth,\n            economic impact, economic policies, EIA, electric power,\n            electricity, ENVIRONMENTAL, Environmental Assessment,\n            environmental conservation, environmental degradation,\n            environmental impact, environmental impacts, environmental\n            issues, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, environmental quality,\n            Global Environment, GNP, hazardous wastes, income, landfill,\n            landfill equipment, landfill management, landfill sites,\n            Landfilling, litter, Middle East, mining, MUNICIPAL\n            ENGINEER, municipal management, Natural Resources, NIMBY,\n            North Africa, odors, oil, open burning, opportunity costs,\n            Pollution Control, power stations, productivity, public\n            goods, public utilities, Quality Assessment, recovery\n            systems, refuse, refuse collection, rural communities,\n            sanitary landfill, sanitary landfills, sanitation, sewer\n            systems, sewerage, sewerage system, sewerage systems,\n            shantytowns, site operation, site selection, SOLID WASTE,\n            solid waste collection, solid waste component, solid waste\n            disposal, solid waste disposal sites, solid waste\n            facilities, solid waste issues, Solid Waste Management,\n            solid waste management strategy, solid waste sector, solid\n            waste transfer, solid waste transfer stations, source\n            separation, SWM, textbooks, urban waste, waste dumping,\n            waste dumps, waste management facilities, waste management\n            scheme, waste management system, waste management systems,\n            waste minimization, waste reduction, waste treatment, waste\n            treatment facilities, waste water, wastewater, wastewater\n            treatment, wastewater treatment plants, water supply, water treatment"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Environment and natural resource management","projn":"LB-Solid Waste/Environment -- P005345,LB-Emergency Recovery -- P005336","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Urban Solid Waste Management,Wastewater Treatment,Sanitation and Sewerage,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Environment","entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20080416012635"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Solid waste management,Central government administration,Power,Other industry,Housing construction","theme":"Municipal finance,Water resource management,Pollution management and environmental health,Other urban development,Other financial and private sector development","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Envir & Nat.

Despite a satisfactory Bank\n            performance, the Borrower performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory, thus lessons are addressed in the context of\n            interest to the Bank, and to the Borrower. Ensuring\n            institutional viability in terms of commitment, and support\n            from the government, the council of ministers, and the\n            parliament, and, clear agreement on important policy\n            dimensions, such as land site acquisition, environmental\n            regulations, participation of municipalities, and cost\n            recovery, should be agreed, supported by public consensus,\n            prior to launching new operations in Lebanon. Unless these\n            factors are ensured, this kind of project will not be\n            sustainable, even though the technical design is the correct\n            one. In particular, social analysis and assessment should be\n            undertaken during project preparation, including as\n            necessary, conflict-resolution mechanisms, to avoid social\n            resistance, while concentrating on fully integrated systems.\n            Furthermore, The Bank should proactively take remedial\n            measures such as canceling the project when the new\n            political leadership does not support it, or if the project\n            is encountering serious obstacles in its implementation,\n            setting a time limit to either restructure, or cancel a\n            project. Lessons for the Borrower, suggest the need for\n            strong, proactive local champions, who can facilitate site\n            selection, and maintain commitment of all stakeholders,\n            including central government, municipalities,\n            nongovernmental Organizations, and local community\n            residents. This is because given Lebanon's ethnic\n            tapestry, a participatory approach to build a consensus in\n            the communities, municipalities, and the central government\n            is necessary to address key strategic issues within a new\n            national solid waste management strategy, that includes land\n            site acquisition, environmental regulations, participation\n            of municipalities and cost recovery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - Solid Waste Environmental\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon -

result of the project\n            implementation at Habline (Jbeil). Following a review on the\n            country's legal, and administrative framework, on the\n            technical and economic benefits of the project, on the\n            Bank's environmental operational guidelines, and on an\n            analysis of alternatives, the EA establishes the management\n            discharge control, proposing mitigation measures (Vol. 1)\n            based on geo-technical site investigations (Vol. 2). Public\n            awareness, and education campaigns were conducted regarding\n            adequate solid waste disposal, while a management plan\n            focused on an environmentally, integrated discharge system,\n            to protect flora and fauna, avoid disruption to green\n            spaces, and re-integrate treated discharges into the natural\n            landscape. To this end, soil erosion will be contained by\n            installing stabilized, underground cement pipes; drainage,\n            sludge, and water residues will be collected at specific\n            storage basins, septic tanks, and/or treatment facilities.\n            During construction, daytime working schedules will be\n            observed, vehicle speed limits enforced, and, machinery and\n            equipment inspected to abate noise disturbances.
