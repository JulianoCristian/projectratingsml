Some lessons learned included: in-country\n            systems input distribution, agricultural credit;\n            diversification support should adequately support emergency\n            operations. In the future, more attention should be focused\n            on appraising and supporting capacity building as an\n            important success factor. The fiduciary management capacity\n            of the implementing agency at the national and lower levels\n            needs to be enhanced. There is need to adequately provide\n            for capacity building of national and district level staff\n            and to encourage computerization and simplification of most\n            of the records. Inclusion of some critical post-harvest\n            interventions can improve project outcomes. Whenever\n            production-enhancing technologies are promoted, it is\n            advisable to also support other off-farm activities such as\n            storage and marketing. Cross-sectoral and international\n            experience, especially in the input voucher scheme, should\n            be incorporated. The Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) should\n            emulate existing transfer mechanisms proven successful in\n            Kenya. Existing programs provide useful platforms on which\n            to build and gradually scale up service activities such as\n            the ones pursued under this project. Overall, the EAPP was\n            justified given the context of Kenya\u0092s import dependence and\n            rising food and fuel prices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Enhancing Agricultural

Productivity Project for Kenya is to assist the\n            recipient to increase access to agricultural inputs and\n            technologies among targeted smallholder farmers in selected\n            districts. There are four components to the project, the\n            first component being up-scaling the existing agricultural\n            credit program (Kilimo Biashara) at a cost of Euro 5.07\n            million.  The project will build on the partnerships already\n            established between the Government, International Fund for\n            Agricultural Development (IFAD), Alliance for Green\n            Revolution in Africa (AGRA), and Equity Bank to leverage\n            additional credit and scale up loans to farmers. The overall\n            strategy is to leverage Equity Bank's enormous\n            resources through a 10 percent guarantee fund on the basis\n            of which Equity Bank will provide credit facilities of up to\n            US$50 million to smallholder farmers, agro-input dealers and\n            other value chain players in the agricultural sector. The\n            second component is the up scaling the existing input\n            voucher scheme (Kilimo Plus) in selected districts through\n            the Government's National Accelerated Agricultural\n            Inputs Access Program (NAAIAP) at a cost of Euro 9.47\n            million. The third component is the up-scaling of the orphan\n            crop program at a cost of Euro 3.08 million. This component\n            will focus on supplying planting materials of orphan crops\n            to smallholder farmers in semi-arid areas.  This will\n            involve promoting farmer involvement in seed bulking and\n            multiplication of orphan and other crops, including sorghum,\n            cassava and millet.  These crops are drought tolerant and\n            more suitable for such areas and could be important\n            substitutes to maize both for human consumption and in\n            providing alternative ingredients to maize in animal feed\n            production.  Finally, the fourth component is the support to\n            project administration costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Enhancing Agricultural Productivity
