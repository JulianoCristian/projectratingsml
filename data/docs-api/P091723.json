Some lessons learned included: the Bank's\n            due diligence on all project aspects is essential even when\n            there is time pressure for project delivery. Reliance on\n            representation is not an excuse. The land acquisition issue\n            at Blace resulted in time delay but in the end did not\n            impact the Project's outcome. However, a similar\n            situation on a large scale project which had not been\n            resolved and remedied very soon could have a much more\n            negative outcome including reputational risk to the Bank. In\n            trade facilitation, some essential investments are not\n            costly. The impact of these investments on institutional\n            reform, however, could be immense. The various software and\n            IT activities are minor investments compared to the civil\n            works. These investments, however, require disproportionate\n            efforts from the Bank in technical and procurement support.\n            Although it is not the case in Macedonia, the failure rate\n            of IT investments in transport projects tends to be high.\n            One reason for success of this Project is that Macedonian\n            Railways (MZ) and Macedonia Customs Administration (MCA)\n            both have a high level of IT literacy. For instance, they\n            both have technical departments which designed the software\n            specifications. These were client-driven processes.\n            Consultations on road design are not always undertaken to\n            produce a better design. In this Project, community inputs\n            have resulted in a better designed investment for the road\n            upgrade. The revision in the motorway design after\n            consultation added social development features for the\n            Project and wider stakeholders' support. Lastly, the\n            Project's implementation arrangement has some\n            duplication of efforts. However, the utilization of public\n            sector staff in project implementation instead of a PIU\n            structure resulted in much better capacity strengthening and\n            project ownership. Under such arrangement, training for\n            implementation staff is crucial. In the future, the Bank\n            should agree with the Government on a package of training at\n            the start of the Project and at Mid Term Review."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Second

Macedonia  is aiming to implement\n            plans for improvement of the existing road infrastructure.\n            The Project for which it is required to develop an\n            Environmental Impact Study is a section of the international\n            corridor E-75 (forming part of the Corridor 10). It\n            represents an artery passing through the country in a\n            north-west direction along the valley of the most important\n            water course -- the Vardar River. Apart from the East-West\n            transportation corridor (Corridor 8, connecting the\n            neighboring countries Bulgarija, Macedonia and Albania),\n            this corridor is regarded as most important development\n            axis, since it enables connection of Macedonia with the\n            developed European countries from the north, as well as\n            provides exit to the Aegean Sea in the South, through\n            Greece. Completion of the highway in its full length is\n            considered a priority, which is supported by the fact that\n            the Government intends to obtain EU pre-accession funds\n            (IPA) to finalize a very difficult section in technical and\n            engineering terms of this corridor. This project covers a\n            section starting from the border crossing Tabanovce and\n            ending at the point where the existing highway is terminated\n            at its leaving the town of Kumanovo, in total length of 8.34\n            km. Some of the environmental impacts and corresponding\n            mitigation measures are: air pollution, to be mitigated by\n            planting vegetation buffer zones; endangerment of wildlife,\n            to be mitigated by relocation and tracking; construction\n            waste and debris, to be mitigated by appointment of a waste\n            manager; cultural issues, to be mitigated by

It is\n            planned that civil works will now be completed by end\n            December ahead of the proposed new closing date in March 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav\n            Republic of - Second Trade and Transport Facilitation\n            Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14473054/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-second-trade-transport-facilitation-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"MK-Second Trade And Transport Facilitation\n            Project-758005 -- P091723","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Trade Policy,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Housing & Human Habitats,Customs and Trade,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,International Economics and Trade,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110628010321"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways,Railways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,International Economics and Trade,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Border Crossing, Customs, Customs\n            Administration, Financial management, implementation plan,\n            Ministry of Transport, passengers, physical progress,\n            Railways, results, Roads, software packages, Technical\n            Assistance, TRANSPORT, TRANSPORT FACILITATION"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"62857"},"13777675":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/02/13777675/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-second-trade-transport-facilitation-project-p091723-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-05","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/02/13777675/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-second-trade-transport-facilitation-project-p091723-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-05","new_url":"2011/02/13777675/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-second-trade-transport-facilitation-project-p091723-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-05","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-02-14T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-02-14T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b0808b0785","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0808b0785","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/ECA/2011/02/14/7D3448FC3C80FFB285257837007AE670/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P0917230ISR0Di021420111297722144015.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/ECA/2011/02/14/7D3448FC3C80FFB285257837007AE670/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P0917230ISR0Di021420111297722144015.pdf","loan_no":"IBRD48590","datestored":"2011-02-14T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-02-14T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of -\n            Second Trade and Transport Facilitation Project : P091723 -\n            Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 05"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav\n            Republic of - Second Trade and Transport Facilitation\n            Project : P091723 - Implementation Status Results Report :\n            Sequence 05"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/02/13777675/macedonia-former-yugoslav-republic-second-trade-transport-facilitation-project-p091723-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-05","projn":"MK-Second Trade And Transport Facilitation\n            Project-758005 -- P091723","docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","authors":{"authr":"Sekerinska,Liljana"},"entityids":{"entityid":"0000A8056_2011021417222475"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Rural/InterUrban Rds,Railways","theme":"Regional integration,Trade facilitation and market access","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"Transport (ECSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Trade and integration"},"facets":{}}}
