Some lessons learned\n            included: including fiscal and governance indicators in\n            sector DPCs is also useful and feasible, too often sector\n            DPCs neglect to use the credit vehicle as an opportunity to\n            embrace cross-cutting public sector management (PSM)\n            interventions. There is no reason to constrain the number of\n            prior indicators to an arbitrary number ten if client\n            circumstances and sector needs and client capability dictate\n            more. This is especially true of multi-sector DPCs. If\n            capacity constraints are the motivation behind constraining\n            the number of indicators, this is mitigated and risk\n            diffused by increasing the number of sectors, each with many\n            fewer than number ten indicators. One of the strengths of\n            this operation is that it had more prior conditions or\n            triggers. There is a huge benefit in requiring and working\n            to include secondary conditions that have been met through\n            credit preparation efforts. One of the strengths of this\n            operation was the numerous secondary indicators that,\n            combined with prior or trigger conditions, resulted in each\n            sector having been accorded the same sort of comprehensive\n            treatment that a single sector DPC might have received."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - First and Second North West\n            Frontier Province
