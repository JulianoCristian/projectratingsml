Some lessons learned included: the Bank should\n            put clients in the driver's seat when designing\n            projects. Client's concerns were obviously unheeded\n            during the design stage which led to the subsequent mismatch\n            between technology chosen by the Information Solutions Group\n            (ISG) and country's technology environment. The idea of\n            one-size-fits-all for the entire world, even for technology,\n            did not work. In projects such as this, Bank management\n            should closely monitor the implementation of the project and\n            should move as quickly as possible to re-structure and\n            re-design the project when it was evident that the original\n            design did not work. Multi-year delays should not be\n            considered acceptable and if necessary, such delays should\n            be reason enough to call for a redesign, re-appraisal, or\n            cancellation of the project. Consensus building is critical\n            to effective project design, preparation and implementation.\n            When host universities change rectors or other key\n            decision-makers, delays can be expected since university\n            objectives and programs may be reviewed and priorities\n            adjusted to reflect the new administrations views. The\n            joining of national and international networks can\n            strengthen the potential sustainability of individual\n            distance learning centers and provide increased access to programming."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Global Development Learning\n            Network Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Global Development\n
