Some lessons learned\n            included: sub-regional HIV/AIDS projects require a project\n            design that clearly defines the roles and responsibilities\n            of the multiple participating national and regional\n            institutions. Multiple stakeholders generate diverse views,\n            approaches and understandings that need to be addressed\n            during project preparation or immediately after the project\n            becomes effective. Government ownership and leadership is a\n            core requirement for successful institutional arrangements\n            and therefore establishing the institutional framework for\n            program implementation is an essential step during the\n            preparation phase. Regional projects take more time to reach\n            agreements on institutional arrangements, including funds\n            allocation. Public-private approaches and partnerships with\n            non-state actors have shown to be useful to quickly scale-up\n            anti-retroviral treatment programs. Long term partnerships\n            however are only viable with assurances of continued\n            financing whether domestic or external. Sharing information\n            is important to the success of regional programs as it\n            fosters regional learning. The regional advisory\n            (RAP's) panels proved to be an important mechanism for\n            those purposes and could be relevant for other programs in\n            health in Africa and beyond. RAPs facilitated learning and\n            served a useful forum for exchanging knowledge and\n            experience and especially fostering a south-south exchange.\n            Fiduciary processes and reporting for United Nation (UN)\n            agencies need to be clarified during project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment\n            Acceleration

There are three\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is testing approaches for scaling-up service\n            delivery for HIV/AIDS care and treatment. These service\n            delivery approaches would be tested through implementing\n            partners identified at country level, who have demonstrated\n            success at providing HIV/AIDS care and treatment on a small\n            scale. Specifically, the implementing partners include\n            associations of people living with HIV/AIDS in Burkina Faso,\n            international Non-government organizations (NGOs) in\n            Mozambique, and private sector clinics and organizations in\n            Ghana. The second component of the project is strengthening\n            institutional capacity for HIV/AIDS care and treatment to\n            ensure adequate referral mechanisms to support the\n            activities of the implementing partners and build overall\n            capacity within the Ministry of Health to scale up national\n            HIV/AIDS treatment coverage. The third and the final\n            component of the project is facilitating regional learning\n            from the TAP countries, with World Health Organization (WHO)\n            providing technical capacity support for the Ministries of\n            Health and implementing partners, while United Nations\n            Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) would support\n            cross-border learning and dissemination of lessons learned\n            within the African continent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - Regional HIV/AIDS Treatment\n            Acceleration Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa Region - Regional HIV/AIDS\n            Treatment Acceleration Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/04/9443912/africa-region-regional-hivaids-treatment-acceleration-project-restructuring","projn":"3A-Regional Hiv/Aids Treatment Acceleration\n            Project -- P082613","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Disease Control & Prevention,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20080515022501"},"theme":"HIV/AIDS,Social risk mitigation,Population and reproductive health,Other communicable diseases,Nutrition and food security","subsc":"Central government administration,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"antenatal care, audits, beneficiaries,\n            capacity building, clinical guidelines, clinics,\n            communities, Community involvement, cost effectiveness,\n            counseling, Description, doctors, drug resistance,\n            expenditures, Facility surveys, health facilities, Health\n            Organization, health professionals, health sector, Health\n            Service, health services, Health systems, health workers,\n            HIV, HIV positive, HIV transmission, Household surveys,\n            households, income, Infection, integration, intervention,\n            interventions, laboratory equipment, learning, morbidity,\n            mortality, nutrition, opportunistic infections, outcome\n            indicators, patient, patients, performance indicators,\n            pregnancy, pregnant women, prevalence, programs, project\n            management, Project Monitoring, Project objectives,\n            prophylaxis, public health, Reagents, rehabilitation,\n            reproductive health, service delivery, Sub-Saharan Africa,\n            TB, therapy, Treatment, workers, youth"}},"owner":"ACTafrica (AFTHV)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF030485-JAPAN CTF - FY04 GENERAL: AFR\n            (ALL COUNTRIES IN AFRICA/ALL SECTORS AND,TF030496-SWEDEN CTF FY04 - GENERAL,TF054328-MOZAMBIQUE : HIV/AIDS - C.
