Although the Project was able to\n            achieve parts of its physical objectives, the overall\n            outcome is unsatisfactory, due to development objectives on\n            the institutional side not being met and lack of\n            sustainability. On the whole, the Bank's performance is\n            deemed satisfactory. The Project was prepared in close\n            coordination with the Government of Lesotho (GOL), and its\n            focus adequately put on institutional reforms. However, the\n            pace at which continuing policy reforms could be implemented\n            and capacity building strengthened under this very Project\n            did not materialize as expected due to institutional changes\n            and to the complex political environment at that time. The\n            key lessons drawn for project implementation and defining\n            policy reforms in the urban sector are that: The involvement\n            and commitment of all stakeholders, including beneficiaries,\n            from the preparation stage is a necessary ingredient to\n            success. Up front policy action plans to be agreed in\n            collaboration with all stakeholders, and restructuring are\n            required to bring about changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Urban Sector Reorientation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho -
