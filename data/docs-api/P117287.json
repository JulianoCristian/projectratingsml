Some lessons\n            learned includes: stated objectives and monitored results\n            indicators need to be realistic and focused on indicators\n            that are attributable to Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC) supported actions. Some of the indicators in the\n            series were situated at a level where attribution was\n            difficult, if not impossible, and where a variety of\n            exogenous factors weighed far more heavily on the\n            achievement, or non-achievement, of results than supported\n            actions. It is clear that policy actions are often not\n            enough to effect significant and sustainable change. While\n            specific policy actions may be necessary to create an\n            environment conducive to change, additional enabling\n            interventions are also frequently required. An additional\n            lesson learned may be that a PRSC series will be more\n            effective if the reform agenda supported by the series goes\n            deeper rather than broader. In addition to including key\n            policy actions in the operation, it may be beneficial if\n            supporting actions, those related to implementation measures\n            or second generation reforms associated with the initial\n            policy action, are also included in the operation in order\n            to ensure increased effectiveness of the initial policy\n            action. Coherence across prior actions and triggers is also\n            important to ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability\n            of supported reforms. Prior actions and triggers should be\n            designed as a coherent, mutually reinforcing package of\n            reforms that together contribute to intended results rather\n            than as a disparate number of individual actions each with\n            its own individual targeted result. It is helpful if the\n            provision of the credit/grant could be closely aligned with\n            the budget cycle. The fiscal constraints imposed by\n            declining and uncertain revenue streams required that\n            expenditures and revenues be closely matched in order to\n            avoid burgeoning budget deficits. The series benefited from\n            significant donor cooperation and coherence and this\n            mutually strengthened donor influence with the Government\n            and allowed for more effective engagement with the authorities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Supplemental Financing for the\n            Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            Project

strategy. Specifically, it\n            supports: 1) modernizing the regulatory framework and policy\n            environment for private investment and infrastructure; 2)\n            increasing progress toward the Millennium Development Goals\n            (MDGs) by raising the quality, efficiency and access for\n            basic social services; and 3) promoting better governance\n            through public financial management reforms. As such, this\n            supplemental financing is complementary to several\n            investment projects that will directly address specific\n            needs in several sectors, including agriculture, urban\n            infrastructure and education. These additional investments\n            will address medium term needs to repair damaged\n            infrastructure, address ongoing and medium term food needs\n            of affected populations and assist in disaster preparedness\n            and mitigation through not only assisting the authorities in\n            their own efforts, but by significantly physically improving\n            some of the hardest hit urban environments so that the\n            impact of future occurrences in these locales are mitigated\n            and minimized.

      Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC-6) is to support\n            implementation of Benin's poverty reduction strategy.\n            Specifically, it will support: (i) modernizing the\n            regulatory framework and policy environment for private\n            investment and infrastructure; (ii) increasing progress\n            toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by raising\n            the quality, efficiency and access for basic social\n            services; and (iii) promoting better governance through\n            public financial management reforms. As Benin completes the\n            last year of its Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction\n            (SCRP) implementation, the country is at a challenging\n            juncture. First, the succession since 2008 of severe\n            external and internal shocks culminating with the negative\n            impact of the 2009 global crisis on the country's\n            economic growth and public finances has taken a toll on\n            Benin's open economy and possibly reversed earlier\n            gains in poverty reduction, and has shown the inadequacy of\n            existing institutions and policies to help the poor cope\n            with these shocks, potentially undermining the foundations\n            for future growth and poverty reduction. Second, though\n            Benin continues to enjoy a broadly stable political climate,\n            the political economy of reforms is likely to become\n            markedly more complex in the next few years with the\n            upcoming presidential elections scheduled for 2011. Third,\n            despite a long period of positive economic growth, the\n            economy has shown little structural change, with limited\n            diversification, a continued dependence of the growth\n            momentum on public spending and significant vulnerability to\n            external shocks, and limited export drive and job creation\n            in the formal private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Sixth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Sixth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit

      Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC-6) is to support\n            implementation of Benin's poverty reduction strategy.\n            Specifically, it will support: (i) modernizing the\n            regulatory framework and policy environment for private\n            investment and infrastructure; (ii) increasing progress\n            toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by raising\n            the quality, efficiency and access for basic social\n            services; and (iii) promoting better governance through\n            public financial management reforms. As Benin completes the\n            last year of its Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction\n            (SCRP) implementation, the country is at a challenging\n            juncture. First, the succession since 2008 of severe\n            external and internal shocks culminating with the negative\n            impact of the 2009 global crisis on the country's\n            economic growth and public finances has taken a toll on\n            Benin's open economy and possibly reversed earlier\n            gains in poverty reduction, and has shown the inadequacy of\n            existing institutions and policies to help the poor cope\n            with these shocks, potentially undermining the foundations\n            for future growth and poverty reduction. Second, though\n            Benin continues to enjoy a broadly stable political climate,\n            the political economy of reforms is likely to become\n            markedly more complex in the next few years with the\n            upcoming presidential elections scheduled for 2011. Third,\n            despite a long period of positive economic growth, the\n            economy has shown little structural change, with limited\n            diversification, a continued dependence of the growth\n            momentum on public spending and significant vulnerability to\n            external shocks, and limited export drive and job creation\n            in the formal private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Assessment letter for the World Bank"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Sixth Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit Program (Vol. 2) : Benin - Assessment letter\n            for the World Bank"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/04/12178827/benin-sixth-poverty-reduction-support-credit-program-vol-2-benin-assessment-letter-world-bank","projn":"BJ-Poverty Reduction Support Grant - Prsc 6\n            -- P117287","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Fiscal Adjustment,Emerging Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100503010633"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Rural policies and institutions,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Decentralization","subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Pre-primary education,Health,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adjustment measures, arrears, bids, bond,\n            budgetary support, capital investment, capital spending,\n            cash deficit, central bank, concession, concessions, Credit\n            Facility, current account, current account deficit, debt,\n            debt service, debt sustainability, Development Bank,\n            Domestic capital, donor support, economic crisis, Economic\n            Developments, expenditure, expenditures, exporters,\n            financial problems, financial situation, financing need,\n            fiscal adjustment, fiscal deficit, fiscal expansion, fiscal\n            policy, Inflation, information system, international\n            investor, Investment Fund, issuance, macroeconomic policies,\n            payment order, pension, pension fund, pensions, procurement,\n            public finances, public procurement law, public spending,\n            regulatory system, salaries, scholarships, strategic\n            investor, structural reforms, tax, tax rate, treasury, Union"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 4 (AFTP4)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Rural development,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"50845"},"facets":{}}}
