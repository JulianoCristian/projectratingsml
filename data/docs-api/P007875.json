The objectives of the project were to: (a)\n            increase accessibility to the project area; (b) increase\n            production on existing farms; (c) improve land management to\n            decrease soil erosion and water run-off, (d) improve the\n            utilization of timber being removed from agricultural\n            lands;( e) test the technical and economic feasibility of\n            sustained yield management of the area's tropical\n            hardwood forests on small and large private landholdings and\n            on public and; (f) improve the health of the rural\n            population; and (g) increase rural employment opportunities.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were\n            as follows: (i) project design should reflect in scope,\n            scale and strategy a realistic assessment of the\n            \"political economy\" within which the project will\n            be implemented; (ii) program approach to rural development,\n            with carefully-sequenced sets of activities designed to\n            build sustainable results incrementally over the\n            medium-term, is a more rational development tool than\n            multi-sectoral and multi-component projects which tend to\n            overwhelm the resources of the Borrower; (iii) projects also\n            need to include measures/incentives to ensure that programs\n            are accorded equal priority with the physical elements of\n            institution-building, by executing agencies; (iv) the\n            strategy must be transparent and participatory and should\n            incorporate financial, social and geographic criteria;\n            project documents should define the beneficiaries and\n            strategy in unambiguous terms, and supervision should\n            monitor performance; (v) the credit-worthiness of\n            smallholders can be enhanced through risk-sharing groups,\n            serious policies governing arrears and the building of\n            credit histories; (vi) beneficiary participation and\n            organization create \"ownership\" of project goals,\n            programs and achievements, and foster sustainability; and\n            (vii) the M&E system should be established and\n            operational before loan effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Caazapa Area Development Report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Caazapa
