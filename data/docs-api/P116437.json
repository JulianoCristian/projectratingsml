Some\n            lessons learned includes: the main lesson here is that the\n            client's leadership capacity cannot be underestimated\n            in development and implementation of successful projects.\n            Integrity, dynamism, bold decision making, and vision\n            characterize some of the leadership strengths in the\n            project. The systems development approach that was adopted\n            was strength of the project. This is an advisable strategy\n            in governance and corruption fraught environments. For the\n            project, the data from the Ministry of Basic Education\n            (MINEDUB), and other related ministries served as the\n            baseline data for overall monitoring and evaluation.\n            However, timely and accurate data for project implementation\n            were not available. The strength of the EFA-FTI project was\n            its relative simplicity. It was designed to support a policy\n            which the government had already put in place. It helped to\n            accelerate and scale up government's efforts, while\n            focusing on systems development and institutional\n            strengthening. The weaknesses in this area caused\n            significant delays in disbursements for the project. The\n            mitigating factor was that the disbursements related to\n            salary reimbursements for payments already made by the government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Education for All-Fast Track\n            Initiative : Support to the Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon -

The project\n            consists of one component.  It will be fully used to support\n            the Government's contract teacher program. It will\n            contribute to the payment of the salaries of 37,200 primary\n            public school contract teachers recruited during FY07, FY08,\n            FY09 and FY10 during: (a) the period from January 2010\n            through the date which is four months after the effective\n            date, and (b) part of the remainder of the 2010 and 2011\n            school year. The indicators for this project will be the\n            reduction in pupil-teacher ratios (PTR) and reduction in the\n            variation of PTR across regions. PTRs are measured by\n            dividing the number of teachers by the number of students\n            within regions and for the nation. The variation of PTR is\n            calculated by a regressing the size of specific schools\n            against the number of teachers in each specific school."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Education for All-Fast Track\n            Initiative : Support to the Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon -
