Both the Bank and the\n            Borrower received moderately unsatisfactory performances as\n            well. One restructuring took place during this project and\n            includes the follows changes: a revision of project\n            components and indicators to compensate for project\n            implementation delays, an extension of the closing date by\n            eighteen months, and a reallocation of proceeds to align\n            project funding with redefined activities. Due to the\n            restructuring the PDO indicators were revised but there was\n            no change in the PDO itself. Component 2 of the project saw\n            a few changes as a result of the restructuring as well. The\n            number of CBCAs was reduced to three sites and funds were\n            increased to extend project support to fringe communities.\n            Lessons learned that were drawn and which could serve as\n            guidance for similar projects in the future include the\n            following: (1) The country\u0092s lengthy and bureaucratic nature\n            of the National Department of Public Procurement needs to be\n            taken into account when designing projects. (2) The\n            Project's PDO and indicators should be carefully\n            reviewed during project preparation. A strong results\n            framework including indicators that are realistic and\n            directly linked to the PDO is fundamental in achieving\n            envisaged project outcomes. (3) A strong M&E framework\n            including a dedicated M&E officer is of paramount\n            importance. (4) Government commitment at all levels is a\n            crucial factor in achieving the Project's envisaged\n            outcomes. The Bank should react promptly (i.e., revising the\n            PDO or closing the Project) to any indications of\n            diminishing commitment levels or other factors that indicate\n            envisaged project outcomes may not be achieved. (5)\n            Sufficient time needs to be allocated for stakeholder\n            consultations and negotiations associated with the\n            establishment of the CBCAs. (6) Financing mechanisms that\n            ensure project outcomes will be sustained beyond the\n            Project's lifetime are important to establish during\n            project implementation. (7) A regional approach to managing\n            coastal marine biodiversity should be fostered. (8) It is\n            important to carefully review the Project's last ISR to\n            avoid a possible disconnect with the ICR's rating. (9)\n            The ICR review meeting should be conducted as early as\n            possible to allow for sufficient time for revisions and\n            government consultation prior to its submission to the Board."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Community Based Coastal and Marine\n            Biodiversity Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Community Based

This\n            is a Level two restructuring of the Project. The\n            restructuring paper seeks the approval of the country\n            director to introduce changes to the project and\n            accompanying amendments to the project's legal\n            documents. The changes include: (i) a revision of project\n            components; (ii) a reallocation of the project grant\n            proceeds; and (iii) an extension of the closing date by 18\n            months, from November 15, 2012 to May 15, 2014. The main\n            reason for the change is to address the project\n            implementation lag and the resultant low disbursement rates\n            through a simplification of project design and a reduction\n            in scope. The original Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            will be maintained. Although the PDO level indicators will\n            be simplified and consolidated for more clarity as presented\n            below, their substance remains unchanged, thereby not\n            affecting achievement of PDO."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Community-Based Coastal\n            and Marine Biodiversity Management Project : restructuring\n            : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/05/14244713/benin-community-based-coastal-marine-biodiversity-management-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"BJ-Community-Based Coastal And Marine\n            Biodiversity Management Proj -- P071579","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Wetlands,Wildlife Resources,Population Policies,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Resources,Environment","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20110525011421"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Water Resources,Environment","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACTION PLAN, aerial photographs, alternative\n            livelihoods, Antenna, appropriate technologies, awareness\n            raising, baseline assessment, baseline data, baseline\n            studies, BIODIVERSITY, Biodiversity Component, Biodiversity\n            Conservation, BIODIVERSITY MANAGEMENT, BIODIVERSITY\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT, biodiversity monitoring, biodiversity\n            resources, Capacity Building, coastal biodiversity, coastal\n            communities, coastal resource management, coastal resources,\n            coastal wetlands, Coastal Zone, Coastal Zone Management,\n            coastal zones, Collection of data, conflict resolution,\n            Conservation, Conservation Area, conservation areas,\n            conservation management, conservation needs, conservation\n            practices, Construction, coordination mechanisms, Data\n            Collection, development plans, digital cameras,\n            Dissemination, economic development, ecosystems,\n            environmental concerns, environmental impact, environmental\n            information, Environmental Management, Equipment,\n            exploitation, financial management, Financing Plan, forest,\n            forests, fragmentation, Geographic Information, Geographic\n            Information system, Global Environment, Global Positioning\n            System, Global Positioning Systems, GPS, hardware, ID,\n            Identification of indicator species, images, impact\n            assessment, Implementing Agency, indicator species,\n            installation, Institution, inventory, inventorying, land\n            use, land use planning, local communities, local\n            development, mangrove forests, MARINE BIODIVERSITY, marine\n            resources, monitoring activities, national policy, National\n            Strategy, natural resource management, natural resources,\n            Nature, participation of communities, participatory\n            conservation, photos, PROCUREMENT, procurement processes,\n            progress, Project Management, Protected Areas, protocol,\n            protocols, Provision of support, public awareness, Radio,\n            regional conferences, Result, RESULTS, rural populations,\n            satellite, short-term training, sites, species, supervision,\n            sustainable natural resource, sustainable natural resource\n            management, sustainable use of biological diversity,\n            technical assistance, technical capacity, Technical Support,\n            television, tourism, users, Web, Web site, wetlands\n            management, Wildlife, wireless internet"}},"owner":"Env., NRM, WRM & DRM Prac 1 (AFTN1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF022015-TARGETING PUBLIC EXP.

This\n            is a Level two restructuring of the Project. The\n            restructuring paper seeks the approval of the country\n            director to introduce changes to the project and\n            accompanying amendments to the project's legal\n            documents. The changes include: (i) a revision of project\n            components; (ii) a reallocation of the project grant\n            proceeds; and (iii) an extension of the closing date by 18\n            months, from November 15, 2012 to May 15, 2014. The main\n            reason for the change is to address the project\n            implementation lag and the resultant low disbursement rates\n            through a simplification of project design and a reduction\n            in scope. The original Project Development Objective (PDO)\n            will be maintained. Although the PDO level indicators will\n            be simplified and consolidated for more clarity as presented\n            below, their substance remains unchanged, thereby not\n            affecting achievement of PDO."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Community-Based Coastal\n            and Marine Biodiversity Management Project : restructuring\n            (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/05/14244724/benin-community-based-coastal-marine-biodiversity-management-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"BJ-Community-Based Coastal And Marine\n            Biodiversity Management Proj -- P071579","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Biodiversity,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Housing & Human Habitats,Wildlife Resources,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures","teratopic":"Environment,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20110525011842"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Bank, biodiversity, biodiversity priority,\n            coastal wetlands, coastal zone, coastal zone management,\n            community, Global Environment, management systems, marine\n            resources, Organization, participatory conservation,\n            Policies, Policy, Project, projects, sustainable use,\n            sustainable use of biological diversity"}},"owner":"Env., NRM, WRM & DRM Prac 1 (AFTN1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF022015-TARGETING PUBLIC EXP.
