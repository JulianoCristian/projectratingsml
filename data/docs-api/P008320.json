The primary objective of the DDSR was to\n            reduce Bulgaria's debt overhang through a significant\n            reduction in its total debt burden. The DDSR operation can\n            be judged a success. Implementation of the project was\n            satisfactory. The performance of the Bank was good. The Bank\n            played an important advisory role in the design, formulation\n            and evaluation of the menu of options of the operation. The\n            performance of the borrower was satisfactory, especially\n            given the political changes. The DDSR agreement was\n            successfully completed in a relatively short time and has\n            largely achieved its immediate objectives. However, the loan\n            accomplished less in advancing pivotal long-term reform and\n            several core development issues remain to be tackled.\n            Several key lessons have emerged from the Bulgarian DDSR\n            experience that may be of broader relevance to other\n            countries in the process of restructuring their commercial\n            debt. First, a country's ability to meet its external\n            debt obligations on a sustainable basis depends on progress\n            in restructuring the economy and restoring the basis for\n            economic growth during the breathing space provided in the\n            first few years of a DDSR agreement. Second, seeking a clear\n            picture of available external financing should come before\n            agreeing on the specific terms of the DDSR. The Bulgarian\n            experience suggests that while pursuing policies that ensure\n            the availability of sufficient resources for its debt\n            reduction operation, a country should also explicitly\n            incorporate its objective for debt reduction into the deal.\n            Finally, directing macroeconomic policies toward preserving\n            financial stability throughout the DDSR process is vital."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Debt and Debt Service Reduction\n            Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Debt and Debt

debt - including about US$1.9 billion in past due interest.\n            The Bank's support will be part of a joint effort with\n            the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to replenish partially\n            Bulgaria's international reserves used to finance the\n            upfront costs of the DDSR agreement. The proposed measures\n            are: (i) a Debt and Debt Service Reduction Loan to the\n            Republic of Bulgaria for US$125 million to reimburse a\n            portion of the cost of the principal and interest collateral\n            of the instruments and/or the debt buyback; and (ii) set\n            asides of US$75 million out of a proposed Financial and\n            Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL), which the Bank\n            intends to submit to the Executive Directors for approval in\n            the second or third quarter of FY95. The Agreement was\n            implemented without direct official support by drawing down\n            Bulgaria's international reserves to less than two\n            months of merchandise imports. Bank and IMF support for the\n            DDSR agreement will help replenish Bulgaria's reserves\n            to a level more appropriate for a small open economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Debt and Debt Reduction Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Debt and Debt\n            Reduction Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/09/735097/bulgaria-debt-debt-reduction-program","projn":"BG-Ddsr -- P008320","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Strategic Debt Management,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Bulgaria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007003504"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,adB,audits,balance of\n            payments,bank portfolios,banking sector,Banking\n            supervision,bankruptcy,bankruptcy\n            law,banks,borrowing,central bank,commercial banks,commercial\n            creditors,commercial\n            debt,creditor,creditors,Creditworthiness,Debt,debt\n            burden,debt buyback,debt conversion,debt outstanding,Debt\n            Reduction,DEBT SERVICE,DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION,DEBT\n            STRATEGY,discount bonds,economic activity,Economic\n            Assistance,Economic Cooperation,economic reform,EIB,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exports,EXTERNAL DEBT,face value,financial\n            performance,financial resources,financial sector,fiscal\n            policy,foreign exchange,foreign exchange reserves,Free\n            Trade,GDP,government bonds,Gross Domestic\n            Product,imports,inflation,interest rate,interest\n            rates,International Investment Bank,international\n            reserves,liquidation,London Club,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,Monetary policy,municipalities,now\n            accounts,outstanding debt,positive effects,private\n            sector,privatization,profitability,Provisions,prudential\n            regulations,public offering,real GDP,savings,short term\n            debt,state banks,Tax,tax administration,tax laws,tax\n            revenues,Technical Assistance,Treasury,unemployment,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,adB,audits,balance of\n            payments,bank portfolios,banking sector,Banking\n            supervision,bankruptcy,bankruptcy\n            law,banks,borrowing,central bank,commercial banks,commercial\n            creditors,commercial\n            debt,creditor,creditors,Creditworthiness,Debt,debt\n            burden,debt buyback,debt conversion,debt outstanding,Debt\n            Reduction,DEBT SERVICE,DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION,DEBT\n            STRATEGY,discount bonds,economic activity,Economic\n            Assistance,Economic Cooperation,economic reform,EIB,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,exports,EXTERNAL DEBT,face value,financial\n            performance,financial resources,financial sector,fiscal\n            policy,foreign exchange,foreign exchange reserves,Free\n            Trade,GDP,government bonds,Gross Domestic\n            Product,imports,inflation,interest rate,interest\n            rates,International Investment Bank,international\n            reserves,liquidation,London Club,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,Monetary policy,municipalities,now\n            accounts,outstanding debt,positive effects,private\n            sector,privatization,profitability,Provisions,prudential\n            regulations,public offering,real GDP,savings,short term\n            debt,state banks,Tax,tax administration,tax laws,tax\n            revenues,Technical Assistance,Treasury,unemployment,wages"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF027985-DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION PROJECT","repnb":"P6403"},"facets":{}}}
