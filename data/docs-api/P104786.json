The changes\n            are twofold: (i) the revision to the project development\n            objective (PDO) to make it consistent with of the PDO of the\n            additional financing approved in March 2011 and (ii) the\n            extension of the closing date of both the original grant and\n            additional financing from October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.\n            At approval of the additional financing it was clear that\n            the completion of the expanded scope of activities will\n            necessitate an extension of the project closing date to June\n            30, 2012.

The extension of the closing date\n            of the parent trust fund to December 31, 2012 has been\n            completed and it is possible now to extend closing dates of\n            both the original SAFDP and the Additional Financing, or AF\n            to June 30, 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan -
