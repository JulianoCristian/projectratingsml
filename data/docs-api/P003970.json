Various reasons contributed to\n            negative results, among them, prudential banking regulations\n            were strengthened only in theory, since timely enforcement\n            did not occur. Similarly, the curbing of economic\n            concentration between the state commercial banks, and a\n            number of industrial group borrowers, did not occur, failing\n            to accomplish significant improvements in resource\n            allocation efficiency. The key lessons suggest, the project\n            was an overly ambitious operation, with both unsatisfactory\n            implementation and supervision. Furthermore, fundamental\n            design flaws led to unrealistic expectations on banks to be\n            re-capitalized, with no adequate nor aggressive\n            restructuring requirements. Despite the change from an\n            adjustment operation, to a \"line of credit\", the\n            adjustment was slow. Hence, the initial quick-disbursing\n            operation, implicitly conveyed, that significant supervision\n            efforts would not be required, thus minimizing effective\n            supervision. In addition, the lack of political will, to\n            prod state bank privatization, and, achieve adequate capital\n            levels, among other factors, hindered success. Complex\n            financial operations, particularly involving institutional\n            development, require experienced professional skills for\n            both design and monitoring, which coupled with staff\n            turnover, weakened the supervision effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
