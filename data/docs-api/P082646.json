Lessons learned\n            include: community management of schools offers many\n            potential benefits, but it is important to understand what\n            communities of different educational and income levels are\n            likely to implement. The education of the poorest children\n            should not depend heavily on the means available to the very\n            poor communities. Before scaling up pilot activities, it is\n            important to evaluate those pilots using robust evaluation\n            designs. In particular, Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs)\n            should strive to create best practice in evaluation in order\n            to maximize learning. Major educational reforms should be\n            based on solid analytical work and take into account\n            relevant research and evaluation from similar experiences\n            elsewhere. There is little evidence that the design of the\n            CSSP drew on research and evaluation findings of experiences\n            with community management of schools, particularly as it\n            relates to learning quality and outcomes, further\n            compounding the lack of robust evaluation carried out under\n            the LIL itself."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Community

By the early\n            1950s the country had only twenty two high schools, of which\n            twenty were community built, financed and managed. In 1972,\n            however, the government took over more than 8,000 schools.\n            But 30 years of neglect had taken a heavy toll. Literacy\n            rates were 52 percent, compared to 58 percent in South Asia\n            and 61 percent among low-income countries around the world.\n            The International Development Association financed Community\n            School Support Project was launched in 2003 to help reform\n            the defunct public school system.

Some lessons\n            learned included: strong political support is required to\n            carry out public sector reforms of any kind. When the\n            general public has lost confidence in the government's\n            ability to provide services, a dramatic change is required\n            because 'band aids' are insufficient to restore\n            public confidence.
