The policy measures supported by this grant\n            are: Reduction to zero of the domestic consumption taxes on\n            five basic food items consumed by the poor (rice, sugar,\n            cooking oil, wheat flour and powder milk). Expansion of food\n            aid and existing social assistance programs (e.g. school\n            feeding, mother-child programs and workfare programs).\n            Ramping up programs which help to improve food security and\n            access to water of the drought-affected population.\n            Developing an action plan to improve targeting of the poor\n            and create more cost-effective, direct social protection\n            mechanisms. There are a number of risks associated with the\n            grant. Djibouti remains vulnerable to commodity price\n            changes and droughts. A further rise in the prices of food\n            and energy could undermine the impact of the\n            Government's program on the poor and may require\n            additional measures to sustain the fiscal balance and\n            macroeconomic stability. However, the Government is\n            currently negotiating a Poverty Reduction and Growth\n            Facility (PRGF) facility with the International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF) and is preparing a number of measures to maintain\n            fiscal stability and debt sustainability even under stronger\n            exogenous shocks. There are also moderate institutional\n            weaknesses which could result in delays in the\n            implementation of the Government's program. In\n            addition, fiduciary risks are significant. These risks are\n            currently being tackled by the Government, in collaboration\n            with the Bank, mainly through technical assistance which\n            addresses budget management,
