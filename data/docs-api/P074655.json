The operation had two\n            objectives. The first was to support the liquidation of\n            Banrural, a financial institution that for several decades\n            had provided subsidized credit for agriculture, accumulating\n            very large losses caused by extreme inefficiencies, low\n            collection efforts and excessive administrative costs. The\n            institution had been able to remain liquid in spite of its\n            huge losses by attracting deposits through unsustainably\n            high interest rates (which will not have allowed it to repay\n            the loans in the future). The second was to help the\n            Government put in its place Financiera Rural, which would\n            not receive deposits or issue any debt, was to be totally\n            financed with an endowment created by the government, should\n            maintain the value of its capital endowment in real terms,\n            report periodically to Congress, lend only to low and middle\n            income rural producers, and move, over time, fully to\n            second-tier lending. The Financial Sector Assessment Program\n            (FSAP) mission that visited Mexico in 2001 had recommended\n            these two actions in view of the negative effects of the\n            large losses in the delivery of credit to the rural areas\n            and in the macroeconomic situation of the country. In\n            addition, the Project was designed to buttress several key\n            development objectives of the Government of Mexico, namely:\n            (a) reducing the fiscal drain of loss-making banks, (b)\n            providing access to financial markets to groups not served\n            by commercial banks, (c) providing prudent lending to the\n            rural sector thereby stimulating output growth and\n            employment generation, and (d) improving the financial\n            performance of Financiera Rural as compared to Banrural in\n            terms of outreach and market coverage, portfolio quality,\n            yields, and financial efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Rural Finance Development\n            Structural Adjustment

A decade ago, Mexico\u2019s development banks accounted\n            for one-fifth of the total credit provided by the banking\n            sector, yet their operations were often inefficient,\n            ineffective and blighted by high costs and undue risks. The\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development worked\n            with the Mexican government to slim down the number of\n            development banks and to make them more effective and\n            accountable, thereby ensuring public funds were being\n            well-targeted and efficiently used.

A decade ago, Mexico\u2019s development banks accounted\n            for one-fifth of the total credit provided by the banking\n            sector, yet their operations were often inefficient,\n            ineffective and blighted by high costs and undue risks. The\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development worked\n            with the Mexican government to slim down the number of\n            development banks and to make them more effective and\n            accountable, thereby ensuring public funds were being\n            well-targeted and efficiently used. Based on recommendations\n            of the joint World Bank and International Monetary Fund\n            Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2000, the Bank used\n            new loans to transform development financial institutions. A\n            Restructuring loan helped transform the Financial Housing\n            Aid Fund into the Federal Mortgage Corporation, a\n            well-respected and market engaged institution. Rural Finance\n            Development Structural Adjustment Loan assisted in the\n            liquidation of Banrural, an institution that introduced huge\n            distortions in the rural finance markets, and instead\n            established the Financiera Rural to provide financial\n            services to small and mid-sized rural markets. Finally, a\n            Savings and Rural Finance Loan helped with the\n            transformation of Pahnal, an economic vehicle to invest\n            small depositors\u2019 savings in risk-free government\n            instruments, into Bansefi, to provide cost pooling for\n            technological development and a common marketing brand for cooperatives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Reforms that help Mexico\u2019s development\n            finance institutions thrive"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Reforms that help Mexico\u2019s\n            development finance institutions thrive"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/03/25157884/reforms-help-mexico\u2019s-development-finance-institutions-thrive","count":"Mexico","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"depositors, rural finance, financial\n            services, pdf, liquidation, transparency, results, financial\n            crisis, future, income, development banks, bank, credit,\n            banking system, information, investment projects, portfolio,\n            financial performance, mortgage, mandates, loan, private\n            sector, mergers, market, ownership, rural markets, credit\n            portfolio, development finance institutions, governance\n            structure, international bank, market segments, instruments,\n            governance, private sector investment, technological\n            development, export sector, access to financial services,\n            trade, financial sector assessment, institutions, savings,\n            financial market, investment, housing finance, market\n            development, commercial banks, performance, restructuring,\n            public funds, financial capacity, banking, cooperatives,\n            innovation, institution, development finance, monetary fund,\n            lending, financial institutions, markets, marketing,\n            enterprises, financial sector, target, adjustment loan,\n            rural finance markets, finance, development bank, banking\n            sector, income groups, employees, banks"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Rural development,Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Reformas ayudan en prosperidad de\n            instituciones mexicanas de financiamiento para el desarrollo"}},"topic":"Financial Infrastructure and Remittances\n            m1326532 350,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Inclusion m1327456 363,Financial Integrity m1326313 328,Financial Architecture and Banking\n            m1327224 318,International Financial Standards m1326534 312","projn":"MX-Savings And Rural Finance (Bansefi)\n            Additional Financing  Proje -- P103491,MX-Fovi Restructuring -- P007610,MX-Rural Finance Development Structural\n            Adjustment Loan -- P074655","subtopic":"E-Business,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Access to Finance,Emerging Markets","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b083148c33_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!North America"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Other financial and private sector development,Rural markets,Gender,Indigenous peoples,Rural policies and institutions,Rural non-farm income generation,Rural markets,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Regulation and competition policy,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Urban services and housing for the poor","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Financial Infrastructure and Remittances\n            m1326532 350,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Financial Inclusion m1327456 363,Financial Integrity m1326313 328,Financial Architecture and Banking\n            m1327224 318,International Financial Standards m1326534 312","owner":"Finance & Markets - GP - IBRD (GFMDR)","trustfund":"TF021390-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR,TFM21390-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR,TFS21390-AGRICULTURAL SECTOR","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"95257"},"facets":{}}}
