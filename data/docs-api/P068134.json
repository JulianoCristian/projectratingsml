Second,\n            various reforms proposed by PSAC I required a longer term to\n            materialize, which may not have been recognized as clearly\n            if the evaluation had been carried out within the time frame\n            established by the OED (six months). While analyzing the\n            lessons learned, however, it must be remembered that the\n            PSAC I was a first operation in a medium-term framework, and\n            it was not intended to solve all the underlying problems of\n            Bolivia's decentralization process. The lessons from\n            the PSAC I may be grouped in four areas: (1) objective,\n            content and approach of the operation; (2) design and\n            management of the operation; (3) impact; and (4)\n            sustainability. They include: setting overly ambitious\n            objectives; limiting project scope too narrowly and\n            neglecting to include the intermediate government level;\n            needing to remove impediments to decentralization by\n            reforming civil service and clarifying responsibilities\n            among agencies delivering services recognizing that two\n            tranches in adjustment operations should be maintained;\n            realizing basket funding is not a substitute for effective\n            coordination of ongoing activities; maintaining a balance\n            between investment resources and unconditioned resources,\n            and clarifying the use of each; continuing the participation\n            of the same counterpart institutions; need to acquire data\n            to assess impacts more clearly, particularly need to set a\n            baseline at the beginning of the operation; recognizing that\n            significant secondary impacts are not covered by the\n            operation; recognizing that there exists no acceptable\n            methodology for evaluating the impact of decentralization;\n            and ensuring sustainability by studying the framework of\n            incentives for participants in the decentralization process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Programmatic Structural Adjustment\n

The comprehensive\n            decentralization reform program, already underway, aims to\n            adapt the existing institutional framework for improved\n            decentralized public service delivery, and governance to\n            implement the Government's poverty reduction strategy.\n            Specifically, the program will support the Government's\n            efforts in improving the delivery of public services to the\n            poor, through increased efficiency, transparency, and\n            accountability of Bolivia's decentralized government\n            system, and through improved capacity within the\n            decentralized government system for delivery of these\n            services. The reform program will improve regulatory, and\n            institutional framework for decentralization; enhance\n            community participation, particularly the poor, indigenous\n            populations, and women; restore fiscal discipline;\n            strengthen the government's financial, and\n            institutional capacity to support delivery of public\n            services; and, improve availability of credit financing for\n            municipal investments. However, associated risks include the\n            inherent lack of institutional capacity in a reform process\n            already underway; socioeconomic deterioration due to\n            political instability; and, potential lack of commitment to\n            reform of the upcoming new administration in 2002."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Programmatic Structural Adjustment\n            Credit
