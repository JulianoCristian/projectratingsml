The success is based on three\n            major activities of the project: a) the deregulation of the\n            mining sector, which stimulated private domestic and foreign\n            investment, achieving more than ten percent increase in the\n            mining-metallurgic production; b) the investment component,\n            which provided a broadened financial support, thus\n            attracting commercial banks participation, despite the\n            economic crisis problems; and c) the improvement of policy\n            and institutional mining operations, which allowed the\n            financing of an increased investment demand in the sector.\n            The lessons learned show that prompt reactions may result in\n            successful operations, when both institutions are quick and\n            ready to adopt each others policies and/or recommendations,\n            as the case may be. The recommendations of the Mining Sector\n            Review resulted in a new Mining Law, obtaining efficient\n            gains from the modernization of mining agencies and, in\n            turn, attracting private investments. Despite a delay in the\n            preparation of environmental regulations, the Government is\n            committed to its enforcement, and the private sector is\n            fully aware of its benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
