Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) using realistic data at appraisal facilitates the\n            evaluation of project achievement. Therefore, emphasis is\n            needed on quality at entry. Under Fifth Tihama, the\n            substantial overestimates of agricultural yields at\n            appraisal made them unrealistic for use as comparator for\n            measure of project achievement; 2) flexibility to reallocate\n            resources is necessary to ensure substantial achievement of\n            project goals when a major and dependable co-financier\n            discontinues funding due to unanticipated circumstances,\n            such as the Gulf Crisis; 3) extension cannot function fully\n            effectively without research. If research does not have\n            adequate staffing, operating budget, and superior competence\n            to produce suitable packages, then its input into extension\n            is likely to be limited. Moreover, extension cannot be\n            effective without adequate operating funds; 4) the design of\n            a cost recovery system should be based on a realistic\n            appraisal of what is workable and achievable given local\n            circumstances. The full cost recovery objective under the\n            project was ambitious. The zakat (religious) cost recovery\n            system is prone to misuse. There is no objective means of\n            assessing farmers' declarations; hence farmers\n            understated their income and thereby the resulting zakat\n            religious tax, without penalty; and 5) inadequate\n            counterpart funds have been a major limitation to project\n            implementation. This suggests that new projects should be\n            undertaken only after a careful review of their incremental\n            demands on the government budget."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen -

Project are to improve\n            agricultural productivity and farm incomes in the Tihama\n            region.  This will be accomplished by propagating suitable\n            technical packages, improving irrigation water management\n            and to strengthen the development institutions to ensure\n            sustainability of benefits envisaged under various\n            agricultural projects in the area.  The project will consist\n            of:  the establishment of a regional extension network,\n            veterinary, operations and maintenance services for the\n            Tihama region; and irrigation development in Wadi Siham.\n            This last component will include the construction of\n            demonstration farms to train farmers in improved irrigation\n            and agricultural practices.  Finally, the project will\n            finance construction of about 62 km of feeder roads;\n            technical assistance and training.  The project will benefit\n            44,000 farm families, or about 220,000 people, through the\n            development of agriculture in the Tihama region."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen Arab Republic -
