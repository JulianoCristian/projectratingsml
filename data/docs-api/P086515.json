Of the three project development\n            objectives indicators, two indicators were fully achieved,\n            while the third indicator was achieved to a large extent.\n            The significant lessons learned during the implementation of\n            the project are: 1) bidding for civil works contracts of\n            such complexity should be done based on detailed designs and\n            construction drawings rather than on preliminary design; 2)\n            the practice of basing task team leaders in the\n            borrower's country should be encouraged; 3) managing\n            resettlement of project-affected persons by provincial\n            governments who were not parties to the loan agreement\n            created a risk for delay in implementation; 4) the use of an\n            independent environmental compliance monitor proved its\n            value in the project, ensuring that proper attention was\n            paid to environmental safeguards while freeing the\n            supervising engineer to concentrate on technical issues; 5)\n            the borrower's project management should be encouraged\n            to make a useful contribution to project-affected\n            communities by handing over to them facilities that are no\n            longer needed, once the project is completed; and 6)\n            sustained sector dialogue in parallel to project\n            implementation can sometimes be more influential than\n            including all technical assistance in the

Yunnan\n            provinces. The closing date of the project will be extended\n            by one year from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The\n            extension is needed to complete the remaining civil works\n            contract and complete related contract expenditures. As the\n            loan is approaching closure, it is requested that a\n            reallocation of funds between categories be undertaken to\n            move remaining funds in categories where expenditures are\n            complete or nearing completion to the works category where\n            the civil works is still under construction.
