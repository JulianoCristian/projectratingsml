Some lessons\n            learned included: the desire to realize efficiencies and\n            comprehensiveness with a larger project should not over-ride\n            the risks inherent in a complex project design. The\n            importance of getting the monitoring and evaluation\n            framework right, from the beginning, cannot be overstated.\n            When fiduciary problems do emerge, Bank management and\n            Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) need to be consulted\n            promptly to ensure timely and decisive actions. The\n            Bank's own team should sufficiently involve the right\n            technical expertise to identify potential problems (for\n            example, civil engineer to conduct on-site supervision).\n            Monitoring documents should not only be candid, but ratings\n            need to be consistent with disbursement lags. Strong\n            Borrower oversight (for example, project steering committee)\n            of the project must be taken seriously from the beginning,\n            rather than only activated once problems emerge. Having the\n            Private Sector Foundation Uganda (PSFU) manage the delivery\n            of the public sector agencies may achieve some objectives,\n            but it can risk reducing ownership by the beneficiary\n            agencies. A Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) specialist\n            should be part of the Borrower's project preparation\n            team and continue to be actively engaged throughout project\n            implementation. For high profile projects like industrial\n            parks, an economically rational and financially viable land\n            pricing policy needs to be applied consistently and\n            transparently. Attracting investment to such endeavors may\n            backfire without infrastructure and serviceable land in place."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Second Private Sector\n            Competitiveness
