Following are several lessons\n            drawn from the project. Provision of external training,\n            equipment, and vehicles can be successful instruments in\n            developing legal institutions, provided there is a\n            fundamental respect for the rule of law, as demonstrated by\n            the judiciary concerted actions to better serve commercial\n            parties, evidenced now by the commercial trust in the legal\n            recourse. Hence, it was the sense of professional duty, and\n            pride that contributed to establish, and accelerate\n            commercial cases, further emphasized by those basic, project\n            inputs, needed to operate professionally. However, even\n            under optimal professional circumstances, the absence of\n            project leadership in the use of resources, hindered\n            success, for the arbitrary, and secretive management, led to\n            an incoherent strategy at the start of the project. In\n            addition, the lack of qualified contractors, and procurement\n            specialists, could have been avoided had an intensive\n            assistance been in place to select appropriate contractors,\n            and ensure satisfactory performance. Public sector reform,\n            accompanied by adequate compensation is vital to ensure the\n            institutional benefits of staff training, for in the absence\n            of civil service pay reform, training becomes an incentive\n            to work in the public sector, but only on a transitory basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Financial and Legal Management\n            Upgrading
