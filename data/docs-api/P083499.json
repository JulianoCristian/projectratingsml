Some lessons\n            learned includes: planning for slow implementation of\n            institutional reforms. Implementation of complex reforms\n            takes time and the project timeline should have accommodated\n            possible delays with decision making. Maintaining regular\n            policy dialogue is therefore key to success. Combining\n            institutional reform and investments under the same project.\n            Careful consideration should be given whether to combine\n            physical investments with institutional reform of the\n            sector. In many cases, such combination would be prone to\n            significant delays and unsatisfactory implementation due to\n            the fact that institutional reform is a lengthy and\n            politically sensitive process and many factors could\n            influence the pace of reforms. Comprehensive analysis of\n            financial and operating performance is critical for\n            successful monitoring of railways projects. A recommendation\n            for future railway projects would be to pay special\n            attention to consistent interpretation and recording of\n            project indicators, particularly when the team composition changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Railways Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Railways Reform

Company published a network\n            statement describing the transport services available, the\n            characteristics of the railway network, the level of track\n            access charge, and conditions for contracting transport\n            services. In essence, the joint effort of the two Macedonian\n            Railways companies, the Ministry of Transport and\n            Communications, and the World Bank team, has turned the\n            previously inefficient, closed, and non-profitable\n            state-owned enterprise into companies that are now more\n            accountable and transparent.

The challenge now\n            facing the government and the railway companies is to\n            safeguard and deepen the reform process.

Its\n            operational performance was declining and was unable to pay\n            staff salaries. Railway Reform Project, financed by World\n            Bank, progressively transformed the single Macedonia\n            railways into two new market oriented companies, set up the\n            conditions for use of the railway infrastructure by other\n            operators, and established the regulatory framework for a\n            multiple operator market.
