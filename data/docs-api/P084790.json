Some\n            lessons learned included: success of institutional reforms\n            depends on level of government commitment. The focus should\n            be on building client capacity for monitoring and evaluation\n            (M and E) through training and investment in computerized\n            systems instead of mostly relying on M and E consultants to\n            carry out project M and E. The effectiveness of large\n            infrastructure investments to rehabilitate and modernize\n            irrigation systems for improved water use efficiency and\n            productivity are considerably enhanced by the inclusion of a\n            well-designed and well-implemented agricultural support\n            services component.
