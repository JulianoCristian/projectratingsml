School-Based Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The second phase of the School-Based\n            Management Project for the United Mexican States received a\n            moderately satisfactory outcome with low or negligible risk\n            to development outcome. Both the Bank and Borrower\u0092s\n            performances were moderately satisfactory. Ultimately there\n            were three restructurings that took place. The first\n            restructuring dropped Component 3 because most activities\n            were not critical to the achievement of the PDO and were\n            supported outside the Project, revised Component 2 to\n            include the impact evaluation previously under Component 3,\n            the provision of technical assistance to states to improve\n            their prioritization of marginalized and indigenous schools,\n            and the carrying out of an monitoring and evaluation survey\n            to collect data from community members on the School Based\n            Management model in Quality Schools Program (PEC) schools,\n            among others. The restructuring also adjusted the results\n            framework to ensure full measurement of the achievement of\n            the PDO. A reallocation of part of the loan proceeds to\n            increase the number of beneficiary schools and an extension\n            of the closing date by one year were also part of this\n            restructuring. The second restructuring reallocated all\n            funds from Category 3 (Consultant Services) to Category 1\n            (Goods, Works and Consultant's Services supported under\n            direct support to schools). This change was needed because\n            Ministry of Public Education (SEP) decided to finance the\n            impact evaluation of PEC with its own resources. The third\n            restructuring reallocated US$93,331.55 from Category 2\n            (Incremental Project Costs) to Category 1 (Goods, Works and\n            Consultants' Services supported under the direct\n            support to schools). The change was necessary, given\n            SEP's decision to finance the remaining operating costs\n            with its own resources. There were six lessons learned from\n            this project and they are as follows: (1) Early adjustment\n            of PDO and project results framework is desirable. (2) A\n            rigorous impact evaluation of PEC is crucial to understand\n            the effect of the program on learning outcomes. (3) Local\n            Education Authorities play an important role in planning and\n            implementing federal programs on the ground. It is important\n            to find compelling ways to ensure that all states provide\n            their PEC counterpart financing in a timely manner and\n            comply with management information systems (MIS) that are\n            compatible with the federal MIS. (4) In future operations,\n            Project procurement and FM should be simplified in regards\n            to the direct support to schools to avoid burdening schools\n            with excessive administrative requirements and delays in the\n            reporting of disbursements and proof of expenditures from\n            the Government to the Bank. (5) Moving into country systems\n            in countries with a solid fiduciary structure could help\n            expedite technical assistance procurement processes and\n            ensure that countries benefit from the technical assistance\n            built into the project designs without necessarily\n            compromising healthy procurement procedures. (6) The\n            simplification and dissemination of school planning\n            instruments help disadvantaged schools put together initial\n            school improvement plans and therefore allow them to benefit\n            more frequently from programs such as PEC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
