Among the\n            lessons learned, an interesting point is raised: the gradual\n            - though dramatic - changes the development agenda continues\n            to experience, conduces also to changes in the composition\n            of the Bank's preparation team, or others, not\n            necessarily being documented, nor sufficiently explicit so\n            as to allow a broader debate on other support options. This\n            situation is reflected in this operation's disconnect\n            between expectations and accountabilities actually\n            negotiated, with those that appeared in the credit\n            agreement. Currently, the use of the Logframe format as a\n            tool for project summary to assure consistency, would have\n            improved the project's rationale, regrettably not in\n            existence at the time of project inception. The\n            implementation readiness adopted by the project (even in\n            light of risks associated with new institutional\n            arrangements) - experienced through a phased approach in\n            resources utilization, followed by a staged increase in\n            municipal management and subproject investments - fostered\n            ownership by municipalities, focused on reform, though, the\n            subsequent adoption by the Bank of the adaptable lending\n            instruments, proved less subject to classical preparation\n            prior to implementation as a means of managing risks, than\n            traditionally. Consequently, the adoption of the pilot\n            project approach (requiring preparation on project criteria)\n            could have explicitly planned the necessary benchmarks ex\n            ante. This said, the Midterm Review conducted an ex-post\n            review, from which lessons were incorporated in a follow-up operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Rural Municipalities

assistance"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Rural\n            Municipalities Project is to improve the management of\n            natural resources to alleviate rural poverty by (a)\n            improving the capacity of national and local institutions to\n            make and enforce sectoral policies, (b) increasing the\n            quality of public investment in a more sustainable use of\n            natural resources that is oriented toward poverty reduction,\n            and (c) enhancing prevailing conservation efforts. During\n            its first year of implementation the project will focus on\n            the western departments of Leon and Chinandega. To prepare\n            the project, the Nicaraguan government used several\n            consultation and participatory mechanisms, including a\n            series of workshops with nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs), community representatives, and local organizations\n            and leaders. These stakeholders, with their on-the-ground\n            presence and firsthand knowledge, made important\n            contributions to the project's preparation from the\n            very beginning. Because the project cuts across different\n            natural resources and sectors, stakeholder participation was\n            integrated into several project preparation instruments,\n            including the environmental assessment (EA), the\n            biodiversity strategy, and the social assessment (SA). In\n            accordance with the project's implementation schedule,\n            the SA initially focused on the western region. The next\n            step is to take the SA to the Atlantic region, and o include\n            an Indigenous Development Plan for groups in that area. This\n            paper concentrates on the contribution of the SA to project\n            design. The main objectives of the SA were to identify key\n            stakeholders, identify the rural poor and assess their\n            living conditions, understand the views of the poor on the\n            causes of poverty and how it can be overcome, understand\n            existing farming systems and their constraints, evaluate the\n            main needs of the poor, and obstacles to income generation,\n            evaluate linkages between poverty and environmental\n            degradation, assess the degree to which the rural poor are\n            organized into NGOs and/or community-based organizations,\n            assess the strength of local organizations and the kind of\n            services the rural poor obtain from them, evaluate the\n            stakeholders' perceptions of local governments,\n            evaluate key gender issues and how the project should\n            address them, and make recommendations on how to\n            eliminate/mitigate risks, stabilize migration, and\n            strengthen the capacity of community organizations to better\n            deliver project services. As part of the SA, the Sutiaba\n            indigenous group was also analyzed. The Sutiabas today\n            constitute an ethnically diverse population coming from\n            different areas of Le\u00f3n and other parts of the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Social assessment for the Nicaragua Rural\n            Municipalities Project : Poverty, gender, and indigenous\n            issues in the integration of environment and rural\n            reconstruction assistance"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Social assessment for the\n            Nicaragua Rural Municipalities Project : Poverty, gender,\n            and indigenous issues in the integration of environment and\n            rural reconstruction assistance"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/1996/09/6815387/social-assessment-nicaragua-rural-municipalities-project-poverty-gender-indigenous-issues-integration-environment-rural-reconstruction-assistance","projn":"NI-Rural Municipalities -- P007790","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Environmental Economics & Policies,Municipal Financial Management,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Urban Slums Upgrading","docty":"Working Paper (Numbered Series)","teratopic":"Environment,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Urban Development,Rural Development","count":"Nicaragua","authors":{"authr":"Correia, Maria"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060525175915"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,General transportation sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","colti":"LATEN Dissemination Note ;

These objectives can\n            be narrowed down more specifically to the following: 1) to\n            establish a mechanism based on municipal governments and\n            community organizations for reducing rural poverty through\n            rural investment in economic infrastructure, improved\n            natural resource management and small-scale communal\n            productive activities; 2) to ensure that central government\n            institutions acquire the capacity to provide a coherent\n            overall framework for natural resource policy making and\n            enforcement, accounting for global, national and regional\n            environmental priorities; and 3) to promote the long-term\n            integrity of a biological corridor along the Atlantic slope\n            of Nicaragua, conserving key global biodiversity values. To\n            meet these objectives, the project will have the following\n            three components: 1) rural municipalities development,\n            including institutional development, information,\n            participation, training and grants; 2) natural resources\n            policies and institutions involving institutional\n            development and an inter-institutional technical assistance\n            program; and 3) Atlantic biodiversity corridor (GEF), which\n            will include land use and biodiversity planning, monitoring\n            and evaluation and a
