Democratic Republic of - Education\n            Sector Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Education Sector Project for the\n            Democratic Republic of Congo had an overall outcome rating\n            of moderately satisfactory. There was substantial risk to\n            development with both the Bank and borrower performing\n            moderately satisfactory. The project development objective\n            and project components were not modified during project\n            implementation. The objective was to prevent further\n            deterioration in the delivery of essential services for\n            primary education and prepare ground for a sustainable\n            development and financing of the sector that will facilitate\n            donor coordination and future transition to a sector wide\n            program. Though the project development objective and the\n            project components were not revised during the life of the\n            project, reallocations were made between components in line\n            with changes made to the scope and nature of project\n            activities. Although a number of risks identified at\n            appraisal have been mitigated over time, two remain\n            particularly salient, both of which are financial in nature:\n            i) although budget reallocations to the sector and increases\n            in education spending39 have increased in recent years,\n            sector needs remain significant and will require increases\n            in funding over time; and ii) in many cases, schools\n            continue to charge parents high fees despite support\n            provided from DPs and the Government to implement the\n            fee-free policy. Given the negative implications of not\n            having sufficient financial resources to carry out planned\n            activities, these financial constraints could challenge\n            gains made in increasing equitable access to primary\n            education, a central objective of the Government\u2019s education\n            strategy. Lessons learned include: 1) project design in\n            post-conflict settings should be informed by an in-depth\n            assessment of available capacity and resources and include\n            steps to address any weaknesses in the earliest phase of\n            project implementation; 2) the identification/establishment\n            of an entity capable of undertaking core M&E functions\n            should be in place prior to project effectiveness; 3) the\n            decision to embed a project implementation agency within the\n            government should be made with consideration for existing\n            government capacity; 4) adopting a national strategy for\n            school construction that involves local agencies should be\n            pursued as a method to lower the costs of building school\n            infrastructure; and 5) placing teachers on the public\n            payroll can be an important measure toward reducing the\n            financial burden of schooling on households, although this\n            alone is insufficient."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of - Education\n            Sector

Education Sector\n            Project for Congo, Democratic Republic of is to prevent\n            further deterioration in the delivery of essential services\n            for primary education and prepare ground for a sustainable\n            development and financing of the sector that will facilitate\n            donor coordination and future transition to a sector wide\n            program. The restructuring is a level two restructuring. One\n            of the strengths of the project, as indicated in the\n            findings of the recent Quality Assessment of Lending\n            Portfolio (QALP), lies with a 'relevant and appropriate\n            DO that reflects the strategic focus of the project'.\n            The restructuring will be undertaken to refine the scope of\n            the project in order to improve project performance towards\n            its development objectives. The components and subcomponents\n            will remain but the restructuring will narrow the range of\n            activities that are included in some subcomponents. Using\n            the positive developments in the sector, alternative\n            measures will be proposed in order to facilitate the\n            financing of teachers' salaries and the schools'\n            operating costs. In addition, the restructuring will\n            introduce, on a relatively modest basis, the community\n            participatory factor in the school rehabilitation program.\n            This factor stems from the school construction strategy that\n            was recently developed by the Government with project's\n            technical support. Finally, the restructuring proposes a one\n            year extension of the project closing date from December 31,\n            2012 to December 31, 2013 to help complete the execution of\n            some core activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Education Sector Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/10/16902788/congo-democratic-republic-education-sector-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"ZR-Drc Education Sector Project -- P086294","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Gender and Education,Education For All,Primary Education","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20121101003124"},"theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Social safety nets,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Education for the knowledge economy,Education for all","subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Primary education,General education sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to primary education, access to\n            textbooks, appropriate training, assessment design,\n            assessment tools, book sector, classroom, classroom\n            rehabilitation, classrooms, community participation,\n            completion rate, computer equipment, Congo, Curriculum,\n            development program, education authorities, Education for\n            all, Education Sector, education services, Education\n            Strategy, education system, enrollment rate, enrollment\n            rates, fee abolition, free textbooks, General education,\n            GER, girls, higher education, Indigenous Peoples,\n            institutional framework, learning, learning achievements,\n            Learning Materials, literacy, Management Framework, manuals,\n            mathematics, monitoring learning achievement, national\n            textbook, payment of teachers, pedagogical materials, Policy\n            Reform, positive impact, Poverty Reduction, pre-service\n            teacher training, primary education, primary education\n            completion, primary enrollment, primary enrollment rate,\n            Primary Level, primary school, primary school fees, primary\n            school teachers, primary schools, primary teachers, private\n            schools, Professional Education, provincial education,\n            Public Expenditure, public primary, public primary schools,\n            public schools, quality of education, reading, retention in\n            school, school classrooms, school directors, school fees,\n            school infrastructure, school personnel, school\n            rehabilitation, schools, Social Development, social groups,\n            study tours, teacher, teacher education, teacher educators,\n            Teacher Pay, teacher qualifications, teacher salaries,\n            teacher training, teachers, teachers? salaries, textbook,\n            textbook content, textbook policy, Universities, use of textbooks"}},"owner":"Education -
