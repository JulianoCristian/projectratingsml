The project is\n            unlikely to be sustained because the institutional and\n            regulatory environment has not changed sufficiently. Overall\n            World Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory on the basis\n            of project design, implementation structure, and the lack of\n            private sector involvement. The overall Borrower performance\n            is rated unsatisfactory due to the apparent lack of\n            commitment by the government and the limited involvement of\n            the ultimate beneficiaries. Key lessons learned pertain to\n            the importance of involving the private sector in project\n            design and implementation; defining the appropriate roles\n            for government and the private sector; clarifying\n            objectives; obtaining government commitment to comprehensive\n            public sector reform; and of acquiring the commitment of all\n            the parties to the project in general."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
