The project was fairly\n            well designed but it did not identify what turned out to be\n            a major risk, the institutional capabilities of the\n            associations which managed the housing projects financed by\n            FONHAPO. Their weaknesses in accounting for the individual\n            housing units in the projects they managed, in registering\n            the liens against the individual properties, and in managing\n            the individual mortgage loans and their repayments was the\n            principal reason FONHAPO's portfolio arrears were so\n            high throughout the implementation of the loan and appears\n            to have been one of the principal reasons for the\n            government's loss of confidence in FONHAPO in 1992 and\n            1993; and 2) the other somewhat related issue, which also\n            may have caused some concern on the part of the government\n            with FONHAPO's performance was the apparent political\n            component in beneficiary selection. While it is unlikely\n            that this element can be completely eliminated from any\n            subsidized program, FONHAPO now plans to introduce a\n            demonstrated savings capability as a condition for obtaining\n            a FONHAPO housing credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

credit for low income families; (b)\n            improve the Low Income Housing Fund's (FONHAPO) level\n            of cost recovery and redirect its subsidies to the poorest\n            groups; (c) improve the cost efficiency of housing\n            solutions; (d) further streamline the administrative\n            procedures of FONHAPO and its subborrowers; and (e)\n            contribute to the improved planning and development of urban\n            areas. The loan will finance a slice of FONHAPO's\n            conventional lending program in starter dwellings, serviced\n            lots and home improvement credits. It will also finance two\n            special investment programs for land tenure and urban\n            upgrading. Altogether, the project will provide new or\n            improved housing for about 250,000 families. In addition,\n            the project will support institutional strengthening for\n            FONHAPO and its subborrowers and studies on building codes\n            and administrative procedures, informal settlements and\n            savings mobilization among low income families."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Second Low-Income Housing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Second Low-Income\n            Housing Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/11/739231/mexico-second-low-income-housing-project","projn":"MX-Low-Inc Hsng II -- P007669","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Urban Governance and Management,Regional Governance,Public Sector Management and Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928090136"},"subsc":"Housing construction,Housing finance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative\n            costs,Borrower,cities,commercial\n            banks,Commitments,conditionality,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,debt,decentralization,disbursement,DISBURSEMENTS,down\n            payments,employment,financial institutions,financial\n            services,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,Guarantor,Housing,Income,land tenure,lending\n            programs,LOAN,loan amount,loan effectiveness,local\n            governments,mortgage loans,municipal\n            governments,municipalities,onlending,public agencies,public\n            sector,Relending,resource mobilization,Retroactive\n            financing,savings,settlements,structural\n            adjustment,subborrowers,subloans,technical\n            assistance,Transport,trust funds,urban areas,urban\n            development,urbanization,wages,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative\n            costs,Borrower,cities,commercial\n            banks,Commitments,conditionality,counterpart,counterpart\n            funds,debt,decentralization,disbursement,DISBURSEMENTS,down\n            payments,employment,financial institutions,financial\n            services,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,Guarantor,Housing,Income,land tenure,lending\n            programs,LOAN,loan amount,loan effectiveness,local\n            governments,mortgage loans,municipal\n            governments,municipalities,onlending,public agencies,public\n            sector,Relending,resource mobilization,Retroactive\n            financing,savings,settlements,structural\n            adjustment,subborrowers,subloans,technical\n            assistance,Transport,trust funds,urban areas,urban\n            development,urbanization,wages,Water Supply"}},"owner":"WB Off:Mexico - MX & CO CMU (LCC1C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"trustfund":"TF029528-PHRD-THIRD LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJ.","repnb":"P5124"},"facets":{}}}
