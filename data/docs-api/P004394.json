The program focuses on : 1)\n            macroeconomic policy adjustments to maintain financial\n            stability; 2) improvements in public resource management; 3)\n            improving expenditure management; 4) enhancing institutional\n            capacities; and 4) promotion of the nonmining private\n            sector, through adjustments in exchange rate and wage\n
