The achievement of objectives was also\n            marginally unsatisfactory because, even though the initial\n            reforms were comprehensive and well designed, the Government\n            did not take all subsequent actions that would have\n            permitted it to consolidate the reforms, while the Bank was\n            unable to provide further financial and technical support to\n            the sector at times when reforms were losing implementation\n            momentum. Overall sustainability is rated unlikely because\n            only the reforms in the petroleum sector seem very likely to\n            hold. The Bank overall performance was marginally\n            satisfactory. Though the Project was well considered and\n            comprehensive, and though the Bank team was responsive in\n            restructuring the operation after the first privatization of\n            SENELEC, the Senegal power utility, supervision by the Bank\n            could have been better. The overall performance of the\n            Government during the Project was marginally unsatisfactory.\n            The failure to maintain the first privatization of SENELEC\n            yielded a number of technical  lessons on privatization: 1.\n            The Bank should not have accepted the privatization scheme\n            proposed by the Government for less than a majority of\n            shares. The idea that a subsequent percentage of shares\n            could be sold to the general public or to SENELEC workers\n            presupposed deeper capital markets than exist in Senegal.\n            Moreover, by confusing the issue of who was the majority\n            shareholder, this schemed weakened the Government's\n            claim that its Strategic Partner was responsible for the\n            necessary investments in power generation and, hence,\n            contributed to the demise of the privatization; 2. When\n            there is an obligation to invest by a strategic partner, the\n            terms should be very clearly stated and defined in the\n            concession contract. 3. Since the Bank did accept a scheme\n            in which bidders could choose the number of shares they\n            would purchase, the criteria for evaluating proposals should\n            have considered both the price per share and the number of\n            shares to be purchased.4. The composition of joint ventures\n            should be based on a clear majority holding by the operator\n            as the 50/50 scheme accepted here caused confusion on\n            ultimate management responsibility and led to inefficient\n            management decisions. 5. When there is a change of\n            government soon before or after a privatization, Bank staff\n            and management should plan to make an extra effort to ensure\n            political ownership of the privatization. The failure to\n            privatize SENELEC the second time may have been the result\n            of the business environment in the energy industry. Although\n            Bank staff advised the Government to take a more cautious\n            approach to ensure success, the bidding process did result\n            in two solid offers. These offers only dissipated as the\n            effects of global factors were felt throughout the industry.\n            In going forward, the lesson learned is that given the\n            difficult environment in the energy sector in recent years,\n            it is even more important that the Bank consider investing\n            in parallel or in advance of privatizations in the sector in\n            order to attract investors in Africa."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Energy Sector Adjustment Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Energy Sector\n            Adjustment Operation Project  : Senegal - Energy Sector\n            Adjustment Operation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2416781/senegal-energy-sector-adjustment-operation-project-senegal-energy-sector-adjustment-operation-project","projn":"SN-Energy Sec.

The overall reform agenda\n            seeks to liberalize the economy, reduce the size of the\n            public sector, foster private sector development, and\n            support social sector development - with the ultimate\n            objective of reducing the incidence of poverty.
