Some lessons learned\n            included: ensuring quality at entry during project\n            preparation is a determinant for a good physical and\n            financial implementation progress as shown by the ESSP.\n            Complementing this lesson, the implementation completion and\n            results report (ICR) is of the view that key sector issues\n            should guide the project's design attuned to the\n            project development objectives (PDOs) ensuring as best as\n            possible, that the Bank's country management unit\n            pipeline agenda existing at the time of preparation does not\n            significantly alter the approved concept design as was the\n            case with the hasty inclusion at appraisal of a largely\n            disconnected component three. Ensure capacity buildup within\n            the mainstream institutions to implement project activities\n            as it was the case, for example, with the scholarship scheme\n            and the learning assessment currently fully managed and\n            financed by Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS),\n            avoiding parallel units whose built capacity tends to\n            disappear at the closing of a project, like the ESSP lower\n            secondary (LS) leadership scheme.

In\n            this paper the authors evaluate the impact of a program that\n            gives scholarships to girls making the transition between\n            the last year of primary school and the first year of\n            secondary school in Cambodia. The report shows that the\n            scholarship program had a large, positive effect on the\n            school enrollment and attendance of girls. The authors'\n            preferred set of estimates suggest program effects on\n            enrollment and attendance at program schools of 30 to 43\n            percentage points; scholarship recipients were also more\n            likely to be enrolled at any school (not just program\n            schools) by a margin of 22 to 33 percentage points. The\n            impact of the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction program\n            appears to have been largest among girls with the lowest\n            socioeconomic status at baseline. The results we present are\n            robust to a variety of controls for observable differences\n            between scholarship recipients and non-recipients, to\n            unobserved heterogeneity across girls, and to selective\n            attrition out of the sample."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Getting girls into school :\n            evidence from a scholarship program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia - Getting girls into\n            school : evidence from a scholarship program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/6965674/cambodia-getting-girls-school-evidence-scholarship-program","projn":"KH-Cambodia Education Sector Support -- P070668","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Tertiary Education,Gender and Education,Education For All,Primary Education","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Cambodia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060802131157"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Tertiary education,Secondary education,Primary education,Other social services","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"attending school, class size, cognitive\n            development, developing countries, Development Goals,\n            distance to school, Economic Status, education for girls,\n            education levels, education sector, Enrollment, enrollment\n            of girls, enrollment rate, enrollment rates, enrollment\n            ratio, female education, gender parity, Girls, Girls Into\n            School, Human Development, interventions, Latin American,\n            literature, Local Management, nutrition, Pacific Region,\n            parental education, Poverty Reduction, primary school,\n            primary school teachers, quality schooling, radio,\n            repetition, repetition rates, rural areas, rural girls,\n            Scholarship Program, scholarship programs, scholarships,\n            school attendance, school enrollment, school level, school\n            visit, school visits, school year, schooling, schools,\n            secondary school, secondary schools, teachers, television,\n            test scores, universal primary education, urban areas"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF030745-DANISH CTF - FY06 (SECTOR -\n            EDUCATION/WSF/L,J, PUBLIC ADMIN/ENV & NATUR,TF051642-PHRD-CAMBODIA: BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT,TF052059-JSDF-CAMBODIA: PUBLIC EDUCATION\n            FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN (RECIPIENT-E,TF052060-JSDF-CAMBODIA: PUBLIC EDUCATION\n            FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN (BANK-EXE TF,TF054868-JSDF-CAMBODIA: MAINSTREAMING\n            INCLUSIVE EDUCATION,TF054869-JSDF-CAMBODIA: MAINSTREAMING\n            INCLUSIVE EDUCATION(BANK-EXE TF TO COVER I","repnb":"36727"},"facets":{}}}
