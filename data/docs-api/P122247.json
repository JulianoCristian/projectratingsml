The Bank's\n            and borrower's performance was rated as satisfactory.\n            The program development objective of a programmatic series,\n            the PRSF 8 and deferred and subsequently shelved PRSFs 9 and\n            10, was to adopt policies that facilitate increased private\n            sector investment and involvement and ease constraints to\n            broad based growth. Even though the PRSFs 9 and 10 did not\n            materialize, the Government of Rwanda and the Bank continued\n            monitoring implementation progress for the triggers and\n            respective development outcomes through Joint Sector Reviews\n            of relevant sectors. The preparation of the PRSF series was\n            built upon comprehensive analytical works and lessons\n            learned from the previous PRSF series (i.e., advancing\n            Government-owned reforms, providing substantial financing\n            and fostering better donor coordination). The key lesson\n            learned from the PRSF series was that the Government\u2019s\n            commitment and ownership were essential to advance the\n            reforms. This was especially evident after the deferment and\n            subsequent shelving of follow-up operations as the\n            Government achieved 9 out of 11 observable outcome\n            indicators in target years. One of the remaining two met in\n            the following years and progress towards achieving the other\n            one is steadily improving. The expectation of impact on\n            private economic activity is likely to materialize over the\n            medium term, given the continuation of policies and

It supports the Government's second\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the Economic\n            Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The\n            EDPRS covers the period 2008-2012 and provides a medium-term\n            framework for achieving the country's long-term\n            development aspirations as articulated in the vision 2020.\n            It describes the Government's development objectives of\n            consolidating the achievements in rehabilitation and\n            reconstruction and accelerating the transformation to a\n            middle-income nation with a knowledge-based economy.

The EDPRS priorities are articulated\n            through three flagship programs aimed at promoting\n            sustainable growth and poverty reduction and improving\n            governance. The Rwanda PRSF series is the Bank's key\n            policy dialogue instrument and it provides a broad framework\n            to support the reform process in Rwanda.
