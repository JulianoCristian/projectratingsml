Most non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use\n            social mobilization techniques to encourage human\n            immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing. In 2008, Senegal\u0092s\n            national HIV or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n            agency planned to replace social mobilization with peer\n            education strategies, having shown the latter to be more\n            effective in some contexts. In the peer-mentoring approach,\n            the information will be transmitted to only a third of\n            beneficiaries and request them to mentor at least two other\n            individuals in the community. It is hoped that transmitting\n            the information to two-thirds of the target individuals\n            through the mentors will allow the mentors to be trained in\n            a more intensive manner, and ensure that the recipients\n            absorb the material in a more user-friendly manner. Peer\n            mentoring proved to be more effective for HIV positive\n            individuals, while social mobilization proved to be more\n            effective in increasing the number of partners of HIV\n            positive individuals who come and get tested."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Development impact evaluation initiative :\n            the effects of social mobilization and peer-education on\n            counseling and HIV testing in Senegal"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Development impact evaluation\n            initiative : the effects of social mobilization and\n            peer-education on counseling and HIV testing in Senegal"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/09/17457080/development-impact-evaluation-initiative-effects-social-mobilization-peer-education-counseling-hiv-testing-senegal","count":"Senegal","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"alternative interventions, behavioral\n            change, beneficiaries, education strategies, evaluation\n            methods, evaluation results, experimental design, government\n            agencies, government programs, HIV, HIV Prevention, HIV\n            Testing, HIV/AIDS, Impact Evaluation, Impact of\n            Interventions, intervention, interventions, learning, male\n            partners, NGO, number of people, peer education,\n            Peer-Education, prevention efforts, sexually transmitted\n            diseases, social assistance, Social Mobilization, technical\n            assistance, tuberculosis, Voluntary counseling, voluntary testing"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"SN-Hiv/Aids Prevention & Control Project\n            -- P074059","subtopic":"Poverty Impact Evaluation,HIV AIDS,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Health Systems Development & Reform,Population Policies","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction","authors":{"authr":"Orozco Olvera,Victor Hugo"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20130319125141"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!West Africa"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Health,Central government administration,Other social services","theme":"Participation and civic engagement,Population and reproductive health,Child health,HIV/AIDS,Gender","colti":"Development impact evaluation (DIME) brief","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
