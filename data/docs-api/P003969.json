Nonetheless, lessons address issues\n            regarding targeted recruitment, and quality improvement. The\n            innovative recruitment scheme, was targeted to voluntary\n            candidates entering the D2 (five-semester post Secondary\n            Diploma Course) program, also offered to teachers from\n            deprived, and remote areas, granting the opportunity to\n            upgrade their skills, and access preferential treatment to\n            the civil service, through a teaching post upon graduation,\n            additionally enhanced by the possibility of returning to the\n            rural areas. This became an equity objective, since not only\n            were teachers more committed to their own communities, but\n            they had the advantages of knowing the local language, and\n            the acceptance of belonging to the community. However, this\n            scheme proved mostly short lived, based on the recruitment\n            dilemma for the highest scoring, a selection not necessarily\n            from deprived areas, but on average from urban areas.\n            Furthermore, education quality improvement will not be\n            sustained, unless action plans maximize staff utilization,\n            and support a continued development, in a collaborative\n            effort by institutions, participants, and external\n            contributors, with the need to model the program along a\n            wide range of pedagogic approaches, redefining the role of\n            head teachers in accordance to the country's changing context."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Primary School Teacher\n
