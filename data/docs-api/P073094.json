A handy\n            portmanteau definition of watershed development is as\n            follows: a watershed may be defined as a geographic area\n            that drains to a common point. Integrated watershed\n            development is generally understood as an approach that\n            combines soil and water conservation with social and\n            institutional development, in addition to pursuing a broad\n            range of activities that meet the felt needs of communities\n            across many sectors, such as rural access, water supply, and\n            income-generating activities.  Assessing watershed\n            development and forest interventions side-by-side is no idle\n            juxtaposition. Obviously, all forests fall within watersheds\n            so there is some merit to having a natural resources\n            management strategy that includes both.  In designing\n            watershed and forest interventions there is a common theme.\n            Both types of project are beset by problems of property\n            rights that have been incompletely specified or questionably\n            assigned or are simply missing. This report assesses two\n            watershed development projects and one forestry project. The\n            objectives of the watershed development projects in the\n            Shivalik Hills and in Karnataka were similar: both sought to\n            improve the productive potential of

Some lessons\n            learned included: clear agreement between the Bank and the\n            client on necessary policy changes can lead to a sound\n            framework for project implementation. Required internal\n            institutional reforms for Community Forest Management (CFM)\n            require time and commitment by forest departments. In India,\n            forest department field officers mainly carry out regulatory\n            and enforcement duties with communities. Policy changes\n            enacted by the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department (APFD) under\n            the project delegated new responsibilities for financial and\n            administrative powers from Forest Section Officer's\n            (FSOs) to Forest Beat Officer's (FBOs). This meant an\n            increased workload at the FBO level and a significant\n            transformation in their approach to dealing with\n            communities, which proved challenging for some staff.\n            Strong, sustained and visionary leadership is required to\n            support a shift from Joint Forest Management (JFM) to\n            Community Forest Management (CFM). To fully empower Vana\n            Samrakshana Samiti (VSS) groups to manage their forests\n            requires sustained commitment by the forest department.\n            Community groups will vary in terms of their own commitment\n            and performance. Cooperation with Non-Governmental\n            Organizations (NGOs) is essential when working with\n            communities. The project worked closely with many NGOs,\n            especially at the inception phase, to formulate government\n            orders in respect of the CFM framework; for community\n

forests in India diminished for decades due to\n            illegal harvesting, uncontrolled cutting of minor (or\n            non-timber) forest products by the poor, excessive grazing,\n            and wildfires. About 30 years ago, India started\n            experimenting with joint forest management (JFM) to address\n            this crisis, formally adopting the model about one decade\n            ago. The goal for the evolution of JFM is community forest\n            management (CFM) that builds the capacities of community\n            institutions, invests in forest productivity, and gives\n            people greater incentives to develop into independent\n            community forest enterprises. The World Bank-supported\n            Andhra Pradesh Community Forest Management Project (APCFMP)\n            is now piloting CFM to demonstrate that as communities\n            become the drivers of sustainable forest management, they\n            can be its greatest proponents. The APCFMP is reversing the\n            unsustainable pattern of dependence among forest\n            inhabitants- commonly landless or owners of small\n            unproductive land parcels who rely on the forest department\n            and wage labor from establishing plantations instead of\n            generating income from enterprises based on a variety of\n            fast and slow-growing species to meet different market\n            needs. The Government of Andhra Pradesh has taken positive\n            steps to empower communities to use forest resources and\n            retain 100 percent of revenues. Additional gains can be made\n            if policy and regulatory changes allowed better market\n            access for certain timber products such as teak, which will\n            be coming on stream in many Vana Samrakshana Samiti (VSS)\n            sites in the next two decades."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Innovative forest livelihoods through\n            community forest management : the experience of Andhra\n            Pradesh, India"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Innovative forest livelihoods\n            through community forest management : the experience of\n            Andhra Pradesh, India"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2009/02/18620915/innovative-forest-livelihoods-through-community-forest-management-experience-andhra-pradesh-india","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture, bamboo, bird, bird watching,\n            brands, cash income, catering, Community Forest, Community\n            Forest Management, conservation, conservation benefits,\n            conservation policies, conservation programs, Conservator,\n            Conservator of Forests, consumer demand, dense forest,\n            eucalyptus, fauna, Forest, forest communities, forest cover,\n            forest department, forest enterprises, forest management\n            treatments, forest product, forest productivity, forest\n            products, forest protection, Forest Protection Committee,\n            forest resources, forest revenues, forestry, forests,\n            illegal harvesting, incomes, LIVELIHOODS, local flora,\n            managed forest, Market Access, market analysis, market\n            information, market position, market research, marketing,\n            marketplace, medicinal plants, middlemen, national\n            conservation policies, national forest, national forest\n            area, natural forest, Natural Resource, Natural Resource\n            Management, NGOs, participatory conservation, plant, prey,\n            private sector, reforestation, retail, sales, silk, species,\n            state forest, State Forest Department, state forest\n            departments, State forestry, streams, substitute,\n            sustainable extraction, sustainable forest management,\n            timber, timber forest, timber forest products, timber\n            products, tour operators, tourism, tourism Development,\n            villages, wildlife, wood, wood Forest Products"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"IN-Andhra Pradesh Community Forest\n            Management Project -- P073094","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Wildlife Resources,Markets and Market Access,Forestry","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Rural Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","authors":{"authr":"Kalaghatgi, Ramesh"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20131209145703"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Forestry","theme":"Biodiversity,Participation and civic engagement,Other rural development,Other environment and natural resources management,Improving labor markets","colti":"Livelihoods learning series ;

This gives small farmers\n            an important economic incentive to adopt dairying for their\n            livelihoods. In India, dairying is recognized as a catalyst\n            for social and economic development. Besides being a source\n            of liquidity and insurance against crop failure, milk is the\n            only product where the farmers realize 60-70 percent of the\n            consumer price. The Rajasthan District Poverty Initiatives\n            Project (DPIP) supports the formation of common interest\n            groups (CIGs) comprising 10-15 members at the village level.\n            It then helps CIGs to identify and implement economically\n            beneficial subprojects and provides with matching grants to\n            get enterprises off the ground. On average the dairy\n            cooperative society (DCS) delivers up to 1,000 liters per\n            day and nearly 2,000 liters per day in the flush season.\n            This way, the DCS links the rural poor to markets under the\n            World Bank assisted DPIP in Rajasthan, India. With the\n            expansion of dairy activities and to promote increased milk\n            production, there is a need to develop persistent and\n            productive pastures for high nutritive quality of cattle\n            feed and to expand the use of qualified veterinarians and or\n            trained youth professionals (para-vets) for animal health\n            and breeding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rajasthan - Milking profits from dairy farming"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rajasthan - Milking profits from\n            dairy farming"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2009/01/18612469/rajasthan-milking-profits-dairy-farming","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to services, Agriculture, animal\n            health, Animal health care, animal health services, animal\n            husbandry, animal management, animal owners, animal\n            purchase, animals, Artificial insemination, asset building,\n            Beneficiary Contribution, bio-gas, Biogas, breed, breeding,\n            capacity building, capacity-building, cash income, cattle,\n            cattle feed, Cattle Insurance, crop production, crop yield,\n            daily basis, Dairy, dairy animal, Dairy Business, dairy\n            cooperative, dairy development, Dairy Farming, dairy\n            industry, dairy plants, dairy production, dairy support,\n            dairying, economies of scale, equipment, Extension, Farm,\n            farmers, farming community, feed, fodder, Food Security,\n            fuel, gender, herds, high quality milk, incomes, increased\n            milk, infrastructure development, integration, lactose,\n            livelihoods security, livestock, livestock animals,\n            Livestock assets, livestock farmer, livestock farmers,\n            livestock sector, living conditions, market access, milk,\n            Milk cans, milk collection, Milk consumption, Milk Coolers,\n            milk cooperative, Milk cooperatives, milk marketing, milk\n            processing, milk processing plant, milk procurement, milk\n            producers, milk production, milk products, Milk Supply,\n            milked, Milking, Net Income, NGOs, Nutrition, parasites,\n            pastures, patronage, Poverty Initiatives, poverty line,\n            private sector, production support, route, routes, Rural\n            Development, rural growth, rural households, RURAL\n            LIVELIHOODS, rural poor, small farmers, Smallholders,\n            sorghum, stall feeding, subsistence, total milk production,\n            transparency, transport, transportation, trucks,\n            veterinarians, vets, village level, wood"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"IN-Andhra Pradesh Community Forest\n            Management Project -- P073094","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Dairies and Dairying,Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Rural Poverty Reduction","teratopic":"Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Transport,Agriculture","authors":{"authr":"Khan, Asmeen"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20131206145346"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Forestry","theme":"Biodiversity,Participation and civic engagement,Other rural development,Other environment and natural resources management,Improving labor markets","colti":"Livelihoods learning series ;

The project will employ community-driven\n            development approach, where community will be empowered to\n            take all decisions for protecting and developing forests.\n            All the VSS have been assigned forest areas for protection\n            and development. Therefore, no new land acquisition is\n            envisaged to undertake project interventions. Furthermore,\n            no physical displacement is expected. The main issue is\n            encroachment in the forest areas mainly for agriculture\n            purpose. There are likely to be some adverse effects or\n            impacts on the families and people in the form of losing the\n            encroached land in the forests under management of VSS and\n            their livelihood source. This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)\n            is prepared to describe the process how the resettlement\n            issues will be addressed. VSS communities facilitated by\n            NGOs will carry out the process of social assessment. About\n            28 percent of the families are likely to be affected, nearly\n            28 percent will be landless largely dependent on encroached\n            lands for meeting their household food requirements. It is\n            expected that some families encroaching forest land will\n            resist surrendering land. The approach proposed to be\n            adopted is to promote surrender of encroached forest land\n            required under no compulsions and pressure on the affected

areas. The three main\n            components include: 1) the establishment of an enabling\n            environment for community forest management, by supporting\n            policy, and institutional changes, as well as capacity\n            building, both of the government, community organizations,\n            and nongovernmental organizations. The Government's\n            institutional framework will be strengthened, to allow the\n            implementation of community-based forest management, while\n            project management support will be provided, to include\n            monitoring and evaluation, consulting services and studies,\n            and operational costs; 2) forest management, focused on\n            improving the productivity of designated lands, through\n            improved planning, and silvicultural practices, using\n            multiple shrub and tree species, including medicinal plants,\n            agro-forestry, common land afforestation, and fodder and\n            pasture development. Adaptive forestry research will also be\n            supported, as will the preparation of a forestry inventory,\n            an environmental and pest management plan, and a forest\n            management information system; and, 3) community\n            development, to improve village infrastructure, and\n            livelihoods, through forest, and non-forest based income\n            generation activities. A tribal development plan would be an\n            integral sub-component in preparing investment proposals,\n            and, a resettlement plan would include mitigation measures\n            for

through improved forest\n            management with community participation. In 1992 the\n            government adopted a Joint Forest Management approach,\n            wherein all forest dependents organize themselves into a\n            cohesive group - Van Samrakshana Samithies (VSS) - to\n            protect, regenerate, and manage the forests. From a mere 200\n            VSSs in 1995, today there are more than 6,700 VSSs in the\n            state managing 1.68 million hectares of forest area. A\n            comprehensive and integrated Social and Environmental\n            Assessment has been done wherein to key issues for forestry\n            sector in general and for the project in particular. Some of\n            the issues include: a) Forestry and environment improvement\n            can directly influence the poverty problem to a great\n            extent. The challenge is how to reach the poorest of the\n            poorest. b) Rapport with the stakeholders by Forest\n            Department builds up the trust relationship. c) Establishing\n            and maintaining backward linkages as well as integrating\n            gender concerns for overall development of rural and tribal\n            families can be better done in a group rather than an\n            individual. d) Combined trainings, orientations,\n            deliberations, filed exposures, and workshops are found to\n            be quite effective tools for advocacy, capacity building,\n            social mobilization, improving performance and skills of\n            VSS, NGOs, and functionaries or facilitators. e) Integration\n            of micro-plan with other
