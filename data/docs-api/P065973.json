Some lessons learned\n            included: project design should be informed by a broad and\n            deep analysis of institutional capacities and a specific\n            capacity development strategy should be developed as part of\n            preparation. This should also include a capacity development\n            framework providing a set of proposed interventions and\n            indicators which respond to the capacity constraints\n            identified at the different levels of project implementation\n            and for the staff concerned. Project experience shows that\n            the Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) support to the Project\n            Coordination Office (PCO) should be more continuous and that\n            the CTA expertise should provide support for project and\n            program management, including financial management, planning\n            and reporting, office and contract management, and\n            experience of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems.\n            Similarly, inputs of field-based Technical Advisor (TA)\n            staff should be programmed to provide a more stable,\n            continual support for project staff. Consideration should be\n            given to instituting regular Borrower and Bank joint reviews\n            of the performance of any TA inputs provided under the credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao

and districts. There are six components in this project. The\n            first component will improve rural infrastructure by\n            supporting the rehabilitation of small-scale irrigation\n            systems, the rehabilitation of rural access tracks and\n            trails, and the improvement of rural water supply and\n            sanitation. The second component, Village Investment for the\n            Poor, will be a block grant allocated to a district for\n            implementing small scale projects identified by the\n            villagers themselves. The third component, Improved\n            Agricultural Services, will provide for: a) institutional\n            strengthening of agricultural services at district,\n            provincial, and central levels for the delivery of extension\n            services; and b) adaptive research and demonstrations. The\n            fourth component will support the policy of transferring\n            responsibility for irrigation management and system to water\n            user associations. The fifth component, environmental\n            management, will finance activities for raising awareness\n            among farmers and extension staff of environmental issues.\n            The sixth component sill provide support for the\n            implementation and coordination units, and in particular\n            strengthen capacity in monitoring and evaluation as well as\n            in
