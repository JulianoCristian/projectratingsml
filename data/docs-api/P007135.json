Major\n            lessons learned from this project include: 1) Institutional\n            Development (ID) involving new practices, such as\n            information-based policymaking requires cultivation. The\n            process is much more organic, and evolutionary. In this\n            case, the use of information and coordination of\n            policymaking for competitiveness and the use of the\n            value-chains and clusters framework were important. Another\n            element is the process of organizing and nurturing of the\n            community that is being cultivated: in this case\n            strengthening the Consejos Consultivos. The third element,\n            development of sustained practice, requires activities that\n            go beyond mere interest to changing behavior. In this case,\n            building consensus based on dialogues using common\n            information (and sometimes common analysis). 2) For the\n            above ID, where blue printing is not desirable, development\n            of the core team is the most important aspect behind the\n            success of a project. The core team must balance\n            administrative/political capabilities with technical\n            capabilities, possibly to be found in different persons.\n            Recruitment of different members is most crucial and the\n            Director of the core team must have demonstrated ability to\n            recruit excellent staff. The secret for the Bank Task\n            Manager is to continuously nurture mutual respect and\n            teamwork within the core group. 3) Going beyond the core\n            team, developing capacity requires hands-on training of\n            Ministerial staff. Repeated training in sectoral analysis,\n            data use, and web content maintenance was a hallmark of this\n            project. 4) Some Technical Assistance cannot be expected to\n            be developed without a certain critical mass of activities.\n            Specialized activities, such as an Agricultural Census,\n            which take place every ten years or so for a small country\n            require inputs from abroad if we are to ensure acceptable\n            quality. The involvement of the United States Department of\n            Agriculture along with an excellent technical group within\n            the core team led to successful implementation of the Census\n            along all aspects of the technical assistance  - quality,\n            cost, and time. 5) Some design issues have to be addressed\n            beyond the project level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Agriculture Census and Information\n            System Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ecuador -

The project has five components. The Agricultural\n            Policy component 1) strengthens sector policy analysis\n            capacity; and 2) strengthens the budget analysis and\n            investment monitoring and evaluation process at the Ministry\n            of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG). The Agricultural\n            Information and Dissemination Service component improves 1)\n            information services on crops and livestock; 2) market\n            prices and news services of MAG; 3) agroclimatic impact\n            evaluations; and 4) MAG Computer Center services.  The\n            Agricultural Sample Census component supports designing,\n            preparing, and executing the national Agricultural Sample\n            Census; and strengthens the data processing capacity of the\n            National Statistics and Census Institute.  The Agricultural\n            Farm Production Survey component improves the national\n            agricultural production survey methodology, speeds\n            processing turn-around, conducts two production surveys per\n            year, and executes one farm expenditure survey during the\n            life of the project.
