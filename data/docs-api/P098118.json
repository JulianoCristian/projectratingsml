Some\n            lessons learned included: strong regulatory compliance in\n            oil, gas, and mining projects alone is not sufficient to\n            achieve sustainability. Rather, there is need for inclusive\n            growth that is measured by economic, environmental, and\n            social performance. A large mining technical assistance\n            should have the flexibility to take on broader environmental\n            and social responsibilities if parallel activities are\n            curtailed, especially in the situation of fragile, conflict\n            states where environmental safeguards are not well\n            established - as was the case in SDNRP. The extractive\n            industries (EI) sector to lead to long-term sustainable\n            inclusive growth in Afghanistan, the Bank will need to\n            support a variety interventions through a programmatic\n            approach which includes, traditional technical assistance to\n            the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum (MoMP) (SDNRP one and\n            two); a National Resource Corridor Project; finding creative\n            tools to leverage financing and mitigate risk for associated\n            EI infrastructure; and development policy lending including\n            triggers related to the passage of the mining law (2013).\n            Environmental and social safeguards must be given strong\n            attention in a project providing technical assistance to the\n            government to attract new investment. The presence of very\n            experienced mining, social, and environmental specialists\n            from the Bank, as well as frequent Bank supervision missions\n            (every 6 - 10 weeks) proved to be crucial to the project\n            responding effectively to meet new needs and challenges\n            around the Aynak mineral deposit especially regarding\n            environmental and social protection and introducing\n            innovative concepts such as mineral resource corridors.\n            There is a need for deep capacity-building within the\n            project

The closing date for the project\n            will be extended from December 31, 2012 until May 31, 2013.\n            The major achievements under the project to date have\n            included: 1) establishing a transparent and accountable in\n            tender processes, highlighted by the successful Aynak and\n            Hajigak transactions which was supported at all stages by\n            the International Advisory Panel (IAP); 2) supporting the\n            implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency\n            Initiative (EITI) and the complementary disclosure of\n            mining-generated revenues; 3) increasing oversight and\n            enforcement capacity of agencies such as the Mines\n            Inspectorate and the National Environmental Protection\n            Agency; 4) strengthening of the Ministry of Mines (MoM)\n            departments responsible for cadastre and mine title\n            management; and 5) supporting archeological activities and\n            cultural preservation at Mes Aynak. The extension is\n            necessary to allow the project to meet select core results\n            indicators prior to closing. The MoM has drafted an action\n            plan to meet those objectives and complete the project. This\n            will be the second extension of the project.
