The main lessons learned from the project are:\n            1) Designing a project that fits government implementation\n            capacity will help ensure its effectiveness and timely\n            implementation. 2) Intensively supervising projects with\n            innovative designs and a dynamic context is critical to\n            address issues that are not foreseen at the time of\n            preparation. 3) Setting procurement thresholds too low can\n            delay implementation of infrastructure projects. 4)\n            Intensive supervision of the design and implementation of\n            urban government\u0092s infrastructure projects is essential in\n            the early years to ensure that works are of adequate quality\n            and that funds are used effectively. 5) Conducting periodic\n            client satisfaction surveys at facilities can both focus\n            staff on enhancing quality of service delivery and help them\n            to understand and overcome obstacles in doing so. 6)\n            Thoroughly preparing a project monitoring and evaluation\n            system prior to the start of a project will ensure that\n            stakeholders can track progress towards the project\n            objectives as soon as implementation starts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Capacity Building for\n            Decentralized Service Delivery

This project consists of three components. 1) This\n            component will complete the Civil Service Reform Program\n            (CSRP) activities and support the launch of the full\n            implementation phase of the CSRP at the federal, regional,\n            and local levels. As a basis for full implementation, the\n            government has acknowledged the need for stronger\n            coordination and change management, high-level commitment,\n            redesign of the CSRP architecture, and the development of a\n            process change modality. 2) Restructuring and empowering\n            local government will facilitate the process of building\n            local governments that are financially sound and have the\n            ability and incentives to improve service delivery,\n            especially to the poor. This component will address\n            financial constraints, capacity constraints, and unclear\n            mandate for local authorities. 3) This component will\n            strengthen the Ministry of Capacity Building as the lead\n            coordinating agency for the development and implementation\n            of National Capacity Building Program and sub-programs\n

framework for the Capacity Building for Decentralized\n            Service Delivery Project for Ethiopia, which finances pilot\n            investments for infrastructure rehabilitation to facilitate\n            a learning-by-doing approach and to test the feasibility of\n            larger scale infrastructure investment components in future\n            operations. This report anticipates that soil and water\n            contamination, vegetation loss, soil erosion, dust, noise,\n            and accidents during rehabilitation activities will be\n            possible negative environmental impacts from sub-projects.\n            Sections of this report illustrate the specific steps\n            financial intermediaries will take in screening sub-projects\n            for environmental impacts and assigning them in the\n            appropriate environmental category. To determine the depth\n            of detail of the environmental impact assessment, the\n            potential impacts in the following areas will be considered:\n            social considerations such as tradition and sociao\n            organization, tenure rights, predominant attitudes toward\n            growth, patterns of interactions, and capacity of local\n            institutions; health issues; protected areas; cultural\n            heritage and archaeological sites; existing natural\n            resources such as forests, soils, wetlands, and water\n            resources; and
