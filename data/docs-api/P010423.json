However, the performances of the\n            Bank, and Borrower gave mixed results, for while the overall\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory, that of the\n            borrower is deemed marginal, for although its technical\n            performance is satisfactory, achievements in environmental,\n            and social aspects leaves room for improvement. The many\n            lessons drawn from the project involve energy sector issues,\n            environmental, and social aspects, and resettlement, and\n            rehabilitation issues. Regarding sector issues, the National\n            Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) - given its strong\n            financial position - should be able to pursue an investment\n            policy on its own for its development programs, and thus\n            reduce its account receivables, to maintain its financial\n            health. It became evident, that the inherent risks in the\n            \"time-slice\" approach to investment were\n            impending, for NTPC continued to rely on the assumption that\n            the second time slice loan would be available, even after it\n            was made clear that their non-compliance with covenants,\n            jeopardized this funding. Environmental, and social issues\n            reflect the importance to involve communities, and\n            non-governmental organizations in the planning of remedial\n            action plans, which eased project implementation. However,\n            further involvement with regulatory agencies should enforce\n            compliance with environmental standards, and review\n            resettlement policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
