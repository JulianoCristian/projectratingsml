Some lessons learned included: sustainability\n            of outcomes is dependent on sustainable water resources\n            management. The sustainability of existing water sources was\n            questioned at the time of appraisal and during early\n            supervision of the project. Reaching the poor requires\n            adaptation of demand-responsive approaches. Household\n            connections and metering is often not affordable in poor\n            areas and by the poorest households. Sanitation components\n            can be complex and require close supervision attention.\n            Harmonization between projects in a programmatic approach\n            can provide more comprehensive and sustainable outcomes.\n            Package contracts for sub-projects are relatively fast and\n            efficient. Monitoring and evaluation should be embedded in\n            community-based projects to provide communities with\n            feedback.

Additionally, installation\n            of latrines, or septic tanks, should only be located at a\n            distance of at least fifty meters from the well, or\n            bore-hole, and, equipment, and training for water testing\n            should be provided; 2) the use of waste water will only be\n            used for crops irrigation, following a careful testing to\n            ensure compliance with the World Bank, and the World Health\n            Organization (WHO) standards; 3) similarly, dried sludge -\n            as soil fertilizer - will only be sold to farmers, following\n            compliance with WHO standards, and, a formal policy will be\n            developed for sludge reuse, and disposal.
