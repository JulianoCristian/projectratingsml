Some lessons learned included: ownership of\n            and commitment to the program at all levels is crucial to\n            the development of primary education and the success of\n            project implementation and realization of outcomes. It is\n            extremely challenging to expand access to the remaining out\n            of school children, who are from among the hardest to reach\n            marginalized groups, and require innovative interventions\n            such as those piloted and implemented under District Primary\n            Education Program (DPEP), including the public private\n            partnership initiatives. Gains in enrollment increases can\n            be diluted unless there is an intensive effort to ensure\n            regular student and teacher attendance, as irregular student\n            attendance impacts quality and defeats the enrollment gains.\n            A strong and credible monitoring system is an essential\n            requirement to allow for effective planning and targeting of\n            programs if necessary. Such a system is best derived from\n            internal monitoring systems and field monitoring, and\n            supported by external validations and evaluation studies.\n            Successful implementation and sustainability is largely\n            dependent on capacity in the system and in the implementing\n            agency. Continuity of staff and adequate staffing of key\n            institutions (such as on the quality side and monitoring)\n            need to be in place to ensure effectiveness of such programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Rajasthan Second District Primary\n            Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Rajasthan Second District\n            Primary
