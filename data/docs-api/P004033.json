Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            include the following: in the future, the use of learning\n            instrument loans (LILs) or any instrument that circumvents\n            any of the usual safeguard investigation during preparation\n            should be subject not only to the normal tests of\n            eligibility, but also the test o f downside risks, be these\n            technical or the likelihood of adverse public opinion; where\n            the client is not familiar with Bank operations and\n            procedures or is confronting serious impediments to its\n            ability to act on that knowledge, continuous presence of\n            competent Bank representatives is a critical factor in\n            moving dialogue and operations forward; when ambiguity or\n            disagreements arise in implementation, particularly with the\n            evolving focus or importance of an activity, an agreed\n            strategy can become an effective management tool;\n            institutions generally respond more favorably to moderate or\n            gradual change than to radical innovation, particularly when\n            power or stature are being threatened; and finally, while\n            fiduciary accountability requires correct procedures and\n            oversight, the development impact o f the Bank's\n            approach to the issue is very much linked to the sensitivity\n            with which it introduces the qualities of transparency and\n            cost-effectiveness as desirable qualities in procurement transactions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Agricultural Productivity\n            Improvement ;

From the implementation experience of\n            the project, a number of lessons can be drawn with\n            applicability in Cambodia and a wider context: (a) the\n            special circumstances of Cambodia in the early 1990s i.e. a\n            country whose human resource base and public sector\n            apparatus had been severely damaged must be taken into\n            account in any attempt to understand the rationale for\n            project design and the idiosyncrasies of project\n            implementation; (b) sustainability can be achieved only if\n            there is ownership within the institutions and interest on\n            the part of the key players; (c) in order to fill a void,\n            three elements of sub-sectoral strategy were identified to\n            be designed during the early years of the project and five\n            were added at the Mid-term Review and these have been\n            valuable in assisting the government and in encouraging an\n            informed dialogue between the government and donors; (d) it\n            is essential that preparatory work (e.g., base-line studies)\n            and system design should be done as part of project\n            preparation and that the monitoring system should function\n            from the beginning of a project; (e) where components were\n            implemented by Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and\n            Fisheries Departments, there tended to be a\n            \"double\" management structure and, hence, from\n            early in the project emphasis was given to the\n            \"main-streaming\" of APIP into the regular\n            structure of MAFF Department; (f) complex procedures\n            concerning the approval of expenditures that had already\n            been agreed to in annual work plans caused significant\n            delays, compounded by delays in the release of counterpart\n            funds; and (g) as a result of its complexity, with nine\n            components and eighteen sub-components, the IDA budget for\n            supervision was consistently inadequate to include the\n            required technical expertise in every supervision mission,\n            and as a result, some components could not receive\n            appropriate technical guidance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Agriculture Productivity\n            Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia - Agriculture\n            Productivity Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/12/7322857/cambodia-agriculture-productivity-improvement-project","projn":"KH-Agricultural Productivity Improvement -- P004033","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Technology Industry,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Crops and Crop Management Systems","teratopic":"Rural Development,Agriculture,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Cambodia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070116104952"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Agriculture,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development, Agricultural\n            Education, Agricultural extension, Agricultural Land,\n            Agricultural Policy, agricultural production, AGRICULTURAL\n            PRODUCTIVITY, Agricultural Research, agricultural research\n            organizations, AGRICULTURE, Agronomy, alternative crops,\n            Animal Health, Animal Production, appropriate technology,\n            basic, Capacity Building, capacity-building, Components,\n            Conservation Farming, Credit Agreement, Credit\n            Effectiveness, Crop, Crop Diversification, Crop Management,\n            crop production, Crop yields, crops, cultivation, DATES,\n            decentralization, development projects, diseases, drainage,\n            dry season, ecological zones, economics, equipment,\n            extensionists, FAO, farm, farm production, Farmer, farmers,\n            farming, farming systems, farms, feed, fertilizer, field\n            trials, financial management, fish, fish production,\n            Fisheries, Food Safety, food security, forestry sector,\n            foundation seed, gender, genetic resources, habitat, health\n            services, human nutrition, human resource base, Human\n            Resource Management, Human Resources Management, husbandry,\n            incomes, Influenza, international agricultural research,\n            international organizations, Irrigation, isolation,\n            laboratories, Land Improvement, Land Management, land\n            tenure, laws, livelihoods, livestock, marketing, meal,\n            morbidity, mortality, natural resource management, Natural\n            Resources, new technology, NGOs, Nutrition, Pacific Region,\n            pest control, Pest Management, pesticide, pests, Plant\n            Protection, Plantations, poverty alleviation, poverty\n            reduction, private sector, produce, production cost,\n            production systems, productivity growth, quality control,\n            quality seed, research program, research programs, rice,\n            Rural Development, rural incomes, rural sector, scientists,\n            seed, seed industry, Seed Production, seed supply, seeds,\n            small farmers, small-scale irrigation, smallholder\n            agriculture, smallholder farming, Soil Fertility, soils,\n            systems analysis, transplanting, Tropical Agriculture, Water\n            Resources, workers"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF029161-PHRD-PROPOSED AGRICULTURAL\n            PRODUCTIVITY AND RURAL,TF029737-PHRD-NORTHEAST RURAL DEV.PROJ.
