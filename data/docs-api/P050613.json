Lessons learned from the project:\n            Choosing adequate indicators can support assessing progress\n            towards achievement of outcomes. When targeted to the\n            underprivileged, scholarships help to keep students in\n            school. Non- formal education can increase preschool\n            enrollment. Large investments in teacher training should be\n            based on clear strategies. Project implementers, even of\n            conventional projects, should focus on outcomes. Involving\n            the community in education infrastructure activities pays\n            off in cost-effectiveness in construction and maintenance.\n            Development and implementation of

The\n            project's development objective is to promote a more\n            equitable and effective basic education system with\n            community involvement in school governance. Specifically,\n            this project increases coverage at the preschool and primary\n            levels; improve quality and efficiency of preschool and\n            primary school education, and promote continued\n            institutional strengthening and modernization of the\n            ministry of education, culture, and sports. There are three\n            components. The first expands pre- and primary school\n            coverage and funds a pilot scholarship program for poor\n            students in the 4th-6th grades. The second component\n            improves school quality by providing in-service teacher\n            training; community preschool teacher incentives; learning\n            materials; training for school principals and teachers;\n            textbooks, classrooms, and a school library; rehabilitation\n            and replacement of primary school infrastructure, including\n            the support of a maintenance program and the provision of\n            teacher housing in targeted areas; and performance based\n            salary incentives to teachers and principals. The third\n            component finances institutional strengthening and\n            modernizes the education system by training school councils\n            and principals in basic education, launching communications\n            campaigns, setting up a national evaluation, and monitoring\n            and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Second Basic Education
