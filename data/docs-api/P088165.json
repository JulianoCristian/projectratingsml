Some lessons learned included: the\n            staged approach (access-use-benefits), the in-built\n            flexibility to adjust interventions to specific needs of the\n            communities to increase the uptake of Information\n            Communication and Technology (ICT) for derived benefits and\n            the close monitoring and adjusting of indicators as the\n            implementation evolves are critical success prerequisites\n            for innovative and complex projects. Multi\n            sectorial-interventions are necessary to tackling different\n            communities' needs however the project design needs be\n            based on appropriate assessments to allow selectivity to\n            ensure the balance between project complexity and optimum\n            impact. Public Internet Access Points (PAPI) role needs to\n            be understood in the evolving community context and\n            supported with different instruments to be able to address\n            increasingly more sophisticated community needs. Governance\n            and ownership at local level are critical risk factors for\n            Local Community e-Networks (LCeNs') sustainability,\n            that are particularly high in crisis periods, and mitigating\n            measures are needed to achieve sustainable results on the\n            ground. The project interventions at school level need to be\n            anchored in national policies for sustainable results and\n            results to be shared nation-wide. The difficulties in\n            designing and implementing e-government services should not\n            be underestimated and need to be considered in the broader\n            context of the public administration reform efforts. The\n            results achieved under the KEP demonstrate the comparative\n            advantage of the Bank in designing and implementing complex\n            and innovative projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Knowledge Economy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Knowledge Economy
