The increasing\n            professionalism of producers, processors and traders and\n            their involvement in the associative movement will probably\n            have lasting effects, since it has increased their revenues\n            and helped them to become operational within Mali's\n            administrative and legal environment. The sustainability of\n            the vitality that the project injected into the Chambers of\n            Agriculture cannot yet be assessed. The Bank's overall\n            performance is rated marginally satisfactory. The Bank\n            recognized implementation errors by the executing agency and\n            took responsibility for addressing the shortcomings. As a\n            result, the project staff was replaced in 2001 and a new\n            implementation plan prepared and launched at a workshop in\n            Selingue. That workshop produced, within a coherent\n            operational plan, a logframe for the project that was\n            intended to make up for the absence of such a document at\n            the time of project appraisal. The Bank also dealt firmly\n            with deficiencies noted in financial management in December\n            2002 by writing two successive letters to the Minister of\n            Finance requesting corrective action. However, the Bank was\n            slow to take action to correct monitoring and evaluation\n            deficiencies, and to suggest the organizational and\n            institutional reforms needed to spur project activities. The\n            overall performance of the Borrower is rated unsatisfactory\n            (U). Although there was consistent commitment to the project\n            despite high turnover of government personnel and project\n            staff, several recommendations from supervision missions\n            were not implemented, and issues of monitoring and\n            evaluation, financial management and institutional\n            arrangements, although clearly identified, were not\n            addressed effectively or in a timely manner. This project\n            demonstrated the importance of beneficiary involvement in\n            monitoring and evaluation. In particular, beneficiaries who\n            contribute to project activities in cash or in kind should\n            be involved in the planning and execution of those\n            activities. Stakeholder participation and consensus-building\n            are essential to a public-private partnership program.\n            Stakeholders must be engaged early in the process, and then\n            kept informed, in order to ensure sustainability and\n            effective ownership. Other lessons pertained to the need to\n            carefully select project implementation staff, who are\n            business-oriented as well as technically competent; the need\n            to have an independent body closely monitor the project,\n            while striking a balance in this case, between Executing\n            Agency control and autonomy; and the need for the Bank to\n            react decisively to important recommendations from\n            supervision missions, followed up by Government action.\n            Lessons for the formulation of agribusiness projects were\n            also detailed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -
