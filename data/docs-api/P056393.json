The project has contributed to a number of\n            lessons as follows: 1) For the Bank to be effective in a\n            conflict/post conflict context, a quick and flexible\n            response is required.  2) The demonstration effect of a\n            transparent and accountable institution in an environment\n            where nothing seems to work has a tremendously positive\n            impact on institutional development. FAS evolved into a\n            credible institution through its ability to function with\n            transparent fiduciary procedures. It set an example of good\n            governance for both the public and the private sector. It\n            was therefore able to attract significant resources from its\n            development partners (donors and private sector). 3)\n            Continuity of staffing in a conflict/post conflict context\n            helps to deliver goods and services.  4) Developing\n            partnerships and enhancing capacity of partners such as\n            churches and nongovernmental organizations who provide the\n            interface with communities, contributes to identification of\n            innovative sub-projects and leveraging of operational costs.\n            Training of such partners can ensure consistency in\n            community participation tools. 5). The requirement of having\n            two women out of five community nucleus members has helped\n            to increase female representation, however, the reality of\n            this participation needs to be closely monitored and\n            supported with training programs. 6) Define social impact\n            indicators upfront. To be able to monitor and measure the\n            impact of a project on social capital, a clear definition of\n            practical indicators (including an appropriate baseline) is required."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - Second Social Action Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Angola - Second Social Action\n            Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/08/5103621/angola-second-social-action-fund-project","projn":"AO-Second Social Action Fund Project (Fas\n            II) -- P056393","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Early Child and Children's Health,Banks & Banking Reform,Community Development and Empowerment,Urban Services to the Poor,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Angola","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20040907105040"},"subsc":"General education sector,Sanitation,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, accounting, actual cost,\n            actual costs, Bank Performance, beneficiary assessments,\n            bilateral donors, Capacity Building, civil society, civil\n            society organizations, clinics, communities, community based\n            organizations, community capacity, community contributions,\n            community development, community empowerment, community\n            involvement, community leaders, community members, community\n            organization, community ownership, community participation,\n            consolidation, decision making, diseases, Expenditures,\n            financial management, girls, government commitment, health\n            care, health problems, health sector, housing, Human\n            Development, hygiene, Institutional Capacity, Institutional\n            Development, intermediaries, living standards, local\n            administration, local authorities, local governments,\n            macroeconomic stability, managerial capacity, managers,\n            migrants, municipalities, needs assessment, peace, Present\n            Value, private sector, procurement, procurement procedures,\n            Project Appraisal, project cycle, Project Identification"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 1 (AFTH1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF025628-PHRD-SOCIAL ACTION PROJECT II","repnb":"29162"},"692998":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/10/692998/angola-second-social-action-fund-project-environmental-assessment","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/10/692998/angola-second-social-action-fund-project-environmental-assessment","new_url":"2000/10/692998/angola-second-social-action-fund-project-environmental-assessment","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/04/000094946_00102005304299/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/04/000094946_00102005304299/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"3399","datestored":"2001-02-07T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2000-10-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Angola - Second Social Action Fund Project\n            : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Social Action Fund Project\n            will improve access to basic services for the poor in rural,\n            and peri-urban areas, through the rehabilitation of\n            community infrastructure in health, education, and\n            sanitation, as a follow-up of the first phase. Therefore,\n            the second phase includes roads rehabilitation, and,\n            construction of small bridges, market buildings, small-scale\n            irrigation, and reforestation sub-projects. However, this\n            environmental assessment identifies a special concern\n            regarding the \"chimapacas\", shallow water\n            reservoirs, with severely degraded, stagnant water, but a\n            major source of drinking water, which endangers health, with\n            the increased risk of malaria. Mitigating measures address:\n            1) construction, and use of chimpacas should not be\n            considered, rather through technical assistance, a properly\n            designed well system should be built for human consumption\n            needs.

utilization of basic social and economic\n            services by target populations. The project consists of\n            three components: 1) Social and economic infrastructure\n            subprojects will support a wide range of small, medium and\n            large-scale subprojects for the expansion and improvement of\n            basic social and economic infrastructure, as well as the\n            provision of training in operation and maintenance of the\n            facilities. The subprojects will be identified by poor\n            communities, implemented with the assistance of an\n            implementing partner, and coordinated with local government\n            representatives, nongovernmental organizations, and sectoral\n            agencies. They are related to education, health, water and\n            sanitation, small-scale community infrastructure, and\n            environmental infrastructure. 2) Capacity building will go\n            beyond pursuing community participation in its operation by\n            supporting independent civil society through training\n            programs to strengthen the institutional and managerial\n            capacity of local organizations. 3) Strengthening the\n            monitoring and evaluation system (M&E) will a)\n            capitalize on the existing strengths of the M&E system\n            and project cycle of FAS I, and b) address the areas for\n            improvements and gaps that were identified at the end of FAS I."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola - Second Social Action Fund
