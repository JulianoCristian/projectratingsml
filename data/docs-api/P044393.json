The relevance rating would have been\n            higher had it not been for ERP's fourth humanitarian\n            objective, which was only modestly relevant to BiH's\n            reconstruction. Emergency Landmines Clearance Project: the\n            project objectives were modestly relevant to BiH's\n            post-conflict recovery program. Both efficacy and efficiency\n            in achieving the objectives were negligible; project\n            objectives were not met, yet substantial costs were\n            incurred. Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration\n            Project: for a country in an emergency post-conflict\n            situation the project objectives were modestly relevant;\n            they emphasized longer-term goals too much, even though they\n            neglected demobilization itself. Efficacy in achieving the\n            relevant objectives was modest, through the effective\n            support the project gave to reintegrating demobilized\n            combatants, albeit on a small scale and fewer than targeted.\n            Local Initiatives Project: All three project objectives were\n            highly relevant to the post-conflict development needs and\n            policies pursued in BiH, already more than a year out of the\n            war when this project began.

The major factors affecting the project were: a) lack\n            of available experience on how to handle mine clearing\n            activities; b) the lack of competitive market conditions for\n            demining services; and c) conflicting approaches toward mine\n            clearing. Six key lessons were learned. The Bank can have a\n            comparative advantage in stand-alone demining projects. This\n            comparative advantage lies more in institution building and\n            developing a commercial demining capacity than on carrying\n            out mine-clearing training or mine awareness programs, for\n            which others have more experience. Projects should integrate\n            more coordination and adequate division of tasks among\n            institutions, especially the United Nations. It is crucial\n            to focus, in the immediate post-conflict period, on\n            information collection and mapping as a prerequisite to well\n            planned priority mine clearing. Commercial approaches to\n            demining have proved to be much more productive that any\n            other method used for this purpose. Clear technical\n            specifications and close monitoring and supervision\n            arrangements are key to a proper implementation of\n            mine-clearing supervision programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Emergency Landmines\n            Clearance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -\n            Emergency Landmines Clearance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728373/bosnia-herzegovina-emergency-landmines-clearance-project","projn":"BA-Emergency Landmine Clearance Project -- P044393","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Business Environment","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99072807520722"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,agricultural production,arable\n            land,audits,bilateral agencies,comparative\n            advantage,conflict,contractors,Cost recovery,cost\n            sharing,decision making,demining,expenditure,international\n            organizations,labor force,living conditions,local\n            authorities,mine clearing,mines,peace,Private\n            Sector,procurement,productivity,Public\n            Sector,reconciliation,reconstruction,reconstruction\n            activities,refugees,rehabilitation,reporting,safety,unit costs"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,agricultural production,arable\n            land,audits,bilateral agencies,comparative\n            advantage,conflict,contractors,Cost recovery,cost\n            sharing,decision making,demining,expenditure,international\n            organizations,labor force,living conditions,local\n            authorities,mine clearing,mines,peace,Private\n            Sector,procurement,productivity,Public\n            Sector,reconciliation,reconstruction,reconstruction\n            activities,refugees,rehabilitation,reporting,safety,unit costs"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF036120-BOSNIA-HEZEGOVINA - EMERGENCY\n            LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT,TF036017-BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - EMERGENCY\n            LANDMINES CLEARANCE,TF033964-BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA -\n            LANDMINES CLEARANCE,TF021193-BHZ - EMERGENCY LANDMINE\n            CLEARANCE PROJECT - II,TF021084-ITALY - BHZ-EMERGENCY LANDMINE CLEARANCE,TF024774-BHZ - 1998 DUTCH LANDMINE\n            CLEARANCE GRANT,TF024052-EMERGENCY LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT,TF021613-LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT FOR\n            BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA,TF024073-EMERGENCY LANDMINES CLEARANCE PROJECT,TF020873-RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM\n            PREPARATION (BANK EX.),TF020212-ADVISORY SERVICES AND TECH.
