A major financing gap should not be\n            initiated if the gap is critical for the project to reach\n            its development objectives. Stand alone microfinance or\n            rural finance projects are more likely to be best practice\n            than small microfinance components within larger non-finance\n            projects. Savings cannot be expected to replace credit lines\n            in the short-term, therefore, reflows may have to be used\n            for a fairly extended period of time. A budget support\n            funding mechanism directly to the microfinance institutions,\n            instead of a cumbersome micromanagement of the\n            project's expenses and procedures, has proven to\n            increase the level of responsibility and ownership in the\n            micro-finance institutions.
