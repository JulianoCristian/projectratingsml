OED assessment focused\n            particularly on one sub-component, the Integrated Pest\n            Management sub-component. It is the first time that OED has\n            looked at impact from this new and expanding area of Bank\n            rural lending. Efficiency and fiscal sustainability are\n            questionable in this component. The project offers five main\n            lessons: 1) Developing a poverty-related logical framework\n            helps to clarify the poverty rationale. 2) Mechanisms to\n            ensure sustainability become more a function of reforms that\n            deliver self-sustaining institutions and cost recovery at\n            the local level than public expenditure commitment from the\n            center. 3) This project raises efficiency and sustainability\n            questions about the use of separate PCUs. 4) Key elements in\n            scaling up extension include maximizing farmer-to-farmer\n            diffusion, enhancing the capacity of farmers to develop\n            their own solutions, cost recovery or privatization,\n            minimizing the cost of trainers through the use of\n            farmer-trainers, and low-cost mass media approach. 5)\n            Projects complex design could benefit from the Computer\n            Project Management systems to track and manage expenditure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Agricultural Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Agricultural\n            Rehabilitation

(MARD), where strengthening its policy planning\n            capacity should have been considered a matter of urgency.\n            Key lessons reinforce the notion that sound sector planning\n            should precede rural development projects, particularly in\n            transition countries, to achieve the expected agricultural\n            management results. Furthermore, provision should be made to\n            ensure continuity of supportive services following project\n            completion, for a potential replication to non-project\n            areas. Small-holder credit operations require independent,\n            and viable financial institutions, with qualified\n            experienced staff, and management to supervise, focusing on\n            timely repayments. Regarding administrative aspects, where\n            diverse project activities exist, it is worth considering\n            separate project coordination units for each component, in\n            addition to Bank staff continuity, to ensure close, and\n            flexible supervision for successful implementation.
