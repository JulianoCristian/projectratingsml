Some lessons learned\n            included: the project design envisaged regular supervision\n            of subprojects by state staff, but the lack of sufficient\n            logistical support somewhat constrained smooth supervision\n            of subprojects in most states. Future operations of this\n            nature should include the procurement of logistics to\n            support supervision.
