Key lessons highlight,\n            first, the need for having a legal framework in place, prior\n            to privatization to avoid unnecessary legal/constitutional\n            barriers, and economic/legal constraints to private\n            investment in new power plants, which delayed\n            implementation. In order to attract private investors, the\n            Government had to provide price, and off-take guarantees for\n            power plants using the Build-On-Transfer (BOT), as well as\n            the more successful Build-Own-Operate (BOO) model.\n            Nonetheless, the passage of the new Electric Energy Market\n            Law will set a new framework, which will allow private power\n            plants to operate without Government guarantees. Second,\n            contracts with the private sector for large investments,\n            such as power plants, should not be negotiated on a sole\n            source basis; rather, contracting should undergo a bidding\n            process. This should prevent the extremely high prices,\n            erroneously negotiated, and agreed by the Ministry of Energy\n            and Natural Resources. Third, details for using an\n            acceptable model, i.e. the BOT model, should be clearly\n            understood by both the Bank, and Government to appropriately\n            deal with contracting negotiations. Fourth, management\n            changes among implementing agencies, reduces effectiveness,\n            and slows decision-making."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK)\n
