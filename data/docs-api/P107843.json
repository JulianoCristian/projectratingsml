Some lessons learned includes: strong\n            government and implementing entity ownership and capacity\n            are critical for effective design and implementation.\n            Project design needs to introduce safeguards to protect the\n            project in case of a change in political situation,\n            particularly when taking risks with a new instrument and new\n            counterparts. Assessing changes in management practices has\n            to go beyond the signing and evaluation of Result Agreements\n            (RAs). Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) should be part of\n            fiduciary review package, particularly if disbursing against\n            results. This will include preparing a solid log frame;\n            developing measurable indicators; and establishing viable\n            M&E arrangements. Bank fiduciary rules and reporting\n            systems remained a challenge even though the project design\n            intended to introduce more flexible arrangements.
