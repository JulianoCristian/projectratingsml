Sustainability is\n            rated likely because the National Directorate for\n            Conservation of Biodiversity (DNCB) developed the technical\n            resilience, social support, and government and stakeholder\n            ownership that helped institutionalize the SNAP and\n            attracted funds to continue operations. Institutional\n            development impact is rated substantial. Bank performance is\n            rated satisfactory. Borrower performance is also rated\n            satisfactory as the implementing agency had strong ownership\n            of the project. This PPAR highlights three lessons from the\n            project: 1) To ensure successful conservation, one must\n            build constituencies, increase risks for violators, and\n            ensure continuing financial support to protected areas. 2)\n            The effective participation of local populations in park\n            protection requires implementing agencies with strong\n            negotiation capacities to help local populations reach\n            agreement on rules of the game to access and manage\n            resources, and with an institutional willingness and\n            capacity to assist local populations in meeting their needs.\n            3) The Bank's stewardship role in politically complex\n            projects requires close supervision and timely information."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -

It was important to\n            the success of the project that the Bank had the flexibility\n            to approve changes in the operating plans as these\n            unpredictable events arose. Events included invasion of\n            areas by commercial forest harvesters, organized union\n            protests over land rights, spontaneous illegal colonization,\n            coca production and illegal mining in protected areas, and\n            institutional collapse. Also, the World Bank needed to\n            respond (although it was not always successful) to the\n            priorities and policies of three different governments.\n            Project sustainability is likely.

The skills mix in\n            supervision missions reflected project complexity. Borrower\n            performance overall was also satisfactory: The system of\n            extending accountable advances to protected areas for their\n            operating costs worked well, and greatly improved the\n            original centralized system operated by the National\n            Environmental Foundation (FONAMA). With the exception of a\n            notable lapse in 1998, project disbursements to area\n            personnel proceeded efficiently, and decentralized\n            administration capacity was developed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -
