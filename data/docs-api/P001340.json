Lessons learned were that 1) the International\n            Development Association (IDA) should not finance projects\n            unless the borrower is committed to implementing policy and\n            institutional reforms that would guarantee their\n            sustainability; 2) IDA should insist on the creation of\n            water utility companies prior to financing major development\n            projects; 3) IDA should encourage borrowers to seek private\n            sector participation options; 4) IDA must carefully design\n            financial covenants, watch performance indicators agreed\n            upon during negotiations, and act decisively soon after\n            evidence of violation appears; and 5) water supply and\n            sanitation projects must be designed to achieve a balance\n            between production and distribution capacities, and waste\n            water treatment and collection capacities so that project\n            benefits reach
