Some\n            lessons learned included: closer attention should be paid to\n            potential resettlement issues, taking into account cultural\n            practices and land tenure issues.

schools,\n            health centers and other social and economic infrastructure\n            through broadened community participation. By emphasizing\n            beneficiary involvement, the project will assure that local\n            development decisions reflect the needs and priorities of\n            rural communities.

Provision of more time will\n            enable the Government to implement needed actions to ensure\n            the full compensation of affected persons.
