Lessons learned include: the choice\n            of Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument was\n            appropriate given the Government's long-term vision and\n            comprehensive reform agenda reflected in the Ten-Year\n            Education Reform Strategy. The APL provided an overall\n            framework for the achievement of the program's\n            development objectives over time and ensuring continuity and\n            sustainability of sector policies. Given the complexity and\n            range of needed reforms, carrying out systematic sector\n            assessments during project preparation is essential and\n            contributes to better project design. Throughout\n            implementation, the Minister of Education (MoES) carried out\n            studies in the following key areas: national standards and\n            curriculum reform; teacher education; education economics\n            and finance; education management; education research and\n            policy; Education Management Information System (EMIS) and\n            school mapping; information technology; instructional\n            technology; monitoring, evaluation and assessment; and\n            textbook development. Integrating project management into\n            the overall operation of the line Ministry triggers greater\n            ownership and responsibility for the reform process. ESDP\n            was designed as such that while the project coordination\n            unit (PCU) was responsible for procurement, financial\n            management, and project monitoring and evaluation, it was\n            the heads of the relevant departments/units of the Ministry\n            who were directly responsible for the implementation of\n            project activities associated within their mandate. The\n            implementation of comprehensive finance reforms involving\n            changes in the structure and management of the system\n            requires political support as well as strong leadership of\n            the respective line Ministry in order to stimulate the\n            needed inter-ministerial collaboration and sufficient\n            support for the change at all levels of the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Education Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Azerbaijan - Education Sector\n            Development

sector based on the Education Reform Program of\n            1999. The purpose of the reform program is to address key\n            sectoral issues, some of which need to be prioritized on the\n            basis of additional analytical work, to improve the quality\n            of education, and to realign the entire sector. The project\n            has 5 components: 1) Quality and relevance of general\n            education through curriculum reform for grades 1-11,\n            development and enhancement of teacher capabilities, and\n            provision of reading materials for school libraries. Design\n            and adopt the national curriculum framework, and prepare and\n            implement new national standards. Establish strong links\n            between education reforms and teacher professional\n            development, textbook and reading materials to stimulate\n            reading habits. 2) Reforms in financing and budgeting so as\n            to gain efficiencies in the use of financial, human, and\n            physical resources. 3) The proposed school grant program\n            will supplement limited resources of specific schools in the\n            three pilot districts to ensure that the poor are not\n            discriminated from benefiting from quality education; 4)\n            Management and planning capacity in the Ministry of\n            Education to use available resources more effectively and\n            efficiently. 5) Strengthening of coordination and monitoring\n

of schools in pilot districts of Azerbaijan.\n            The project for repairing and modernizing existing\n            structures pose a number of challenges. Decay can rarely be\n            determined prior to tearing out or dismantling an existing\n            construction. Repairs of buildings should be executed during\n            the summer academic recess to minimize disruption of\n            schooling. Discovery of serious structural and mechanical\n            problems during either the survey or construction phase\n            poses serious ethical, legal and financial challenges. Leaky\n            roofs if not promptly repaired will result in damage to\n            structural components of buildings. The most common problem\n            is decay of the timber trusses that support the roof. In\n            order to arrest deterioration of buildings, essential\n            repairs to elements such as roofs and foundations should be\n            carried out. Maintain storm water drainage systems, replace\n            broken window glasses, loose stair treads and floorboards to\n            prevent deterioration of a building. Improve building\n            insulation, caulking gaps between masonry walls and floor\n            frames; install thermostatic controls on radiators and\n            convectors and upgrading lighting systems will reduce cost\n            of operation. Azerbaijan needs to consolidate small schools\n            to form more economical units wherever practical.\n            Consolidation of schools will require the construction of\n            additional classroom capacity at the receiving school."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Education Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Azerbaijan - Education Sector\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/01/2155613/azerbaijan-education-sector-development-project","projn":"AZ-Education Sector Development Project -- P070989","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Urban Housing,Sanitation and Sewerage","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Education","count":"Azerbaijan","authors":{"authr":"Azerbaijan"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03030604014969"},"subsc":"General education sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"addition,Air,Air\n            pollution,asbestos,clinics,construction,copper,copper\n            pipes,drainage,Ecology,engineering,environmental\n            protection,habitat,hazard,insulation,languages,Latrines,learning,mass\n            media,media,parents,pipes,plumbing,repair,safety,sanitation,schools,science\n            laboratories,septic tanks,sewage,sewage network,solid\n            wastes,storm water,villages,Waste,Waste water,Water\n            quality,water renovation,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"addition,Air,Air\n            pollution,asbestos,clinics,construction,copper,copper\n            pipes,drainage,Ecology,engineering,environmental\n            protection,habitat,hazard,insulation,languages,Latrines,learning,mass\n            media,media,parents,pipes,plumbing,repair,safety,sanitation,schools,science\n            laboratories,septic tanks,sewage,sewage network,solid\n            wastes,storm water,villages,Waste,Waste water,Water\n            quality,water renovation,water supply"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"trustfund":"TF030383-NORWEGIAN CTF FY03 - GENERAL\n            (IDA ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES, ALL SECTORS, ALL,TF038664-AZERBAIJAN:  EDUCATION SECTOR\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF026438-PHRD-AZERBAIJAN: EDUCATION\n            SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","repnb":"E696"},"facets":{}}}
