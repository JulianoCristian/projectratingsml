Some lessons learned\n            includes: project design needs to be more realistic in terms\n            of the range of activities and how they are implemented.\n            Teams need to better appreciate the importance of getting\n            the results framework right at the outset. This means\n            ensuring that the objectives accurately reflect the project\n            activities and the real intent of the project-in this case,\n            laying the foundation through legal, regulatory, and\n            institutional reforms and capacity building. Despite its\n            complexity and ambitious time frame, FSP is a good example\n            of a high-risk, high-reward operation in a sector where\n            reforms are difficult and take time. Notwithstanding the\n            goal of mainstreaming, project management should be\n            structured to make sure that the incentives are in place for\n            implementing agency staff to give sufficient attention to\n            project implementation. Given the implicit capacity building\n            objective of this type of project, south-south learning\n            exchange is highly valuable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Financial Sector

The closing date for the project will be\n            extended from July 31, 2011 until January 31, 2013. The\n            extension of FSP is critical because the project provides a\n            comprehensive coverage of the financial sector in Tanzania\n            and supports most of the activities recommended by the\n            Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update (September\n            2010) under the government's financial sector\n            framework. If no extension is made, a grace period of more\n            than 18 months will be needed for some of the ongoing\n            contracts whose expiry period extends up to 18 months\n            according to the World Bank requirements. The extension of\n            closing date is therefore critical to achieve the project\n            development objective (PDO) and ensure its sustainability.\n            This will be the first extension of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Financial Sector\n            Support Project : restructuring  (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/07/14649330/tanzania-financial-sector-support-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"TZ-Financial Sector Support Project -- P099231","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Debt Markets,Emerging Markets,E-Business,E-Finance and E-Security","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20110726001959"},"subsc":"Banking,Non-compulsory pensions and insurance,Micro- and SME finance,Central government administration,Capital markets","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to financial services, bank\n            supervision, Banking Sector, Banking Supervision, BOT,\n            capital adequacy, commercial banks, corporate bonds, Credit\n            information, Data Collection, deposit, deposit rates,\n            disbursement, Exchange rate, financial institutions,\n            financial intermediation, Financial Management, Financial\n            Markets, FINANCIAL SECTOR, Financial Sector Assessment,\n            financial service providers, financial stability, formal\n            financial service, government securities, grace period,\n            Holding, Housing Finance, income, institution, insurance,\n            insurance companies, Insurance Industry, insurance policies,\n            Interest rates, International Development, lending\n            portfolio, Long-term Finance, Long-term loans, market\n            capitalization, mortgage, mortgage lending, nonperforming\n            loans, Operational costs, Pension, pension funds, Pension\n            System, Private Partnership, private sector, Procurement,\n            procurement process, procurement processes, Project\n            Management, Result, Results, Rural Finance, savings, savings\n            accounts, secondary market, Stock Exchange, targets,\n            tranches, turnover, uses"}},"owner":"AFT:Fin&PrivSecDev East&Southern (AFTFE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"63482"},"facets":{}}}
