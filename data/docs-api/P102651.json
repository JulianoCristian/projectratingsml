Some lessons learned included : First, Policy\n            Based Guarantee (PBGs)  are a potentially important\n            instrument that could be used effectively to support client\n            countries in tapping international markets on favorable\n            terms in combination with other lending and advisory\n            instruments to help countries meet the development\n            challenges of the twenty-first century. Second, this highly\n            satisfactory operation shows that the Bank can productively\n            take informed risks with new and innovative instruments to\n            support client needs in a timely fashion in a manner that\n            will not have been possible with standard instruments of\n            Bank support. Third, this operation shows that the PBG can\n            be a particularly effective instrument of budget support\n            under certain conditions. Fourth, the PBG can unlock\n            multiple benefits to the borrower, which may not be easily\n            captured by alternatives such as a standard Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL). Fifth, it is important to recognize that\n            risks such as a bullet repayment feature could add to the\n            borrower\u2019s risk of repayment in the future unless it is\n            accompanied by ex-ante provisions equal to the amount\n            required under a standard annual repayment schedule. Sixth,\n            strong and relevant design and high achievement are much\n            more likely when the operation\u2019s design is informed by\n            considerable knowledge work, intensive and longer term Bank\n            engagement and dialogue, and a relationship of trust between\n            the Bank and the borrower. Seventh, Bank staff engagement in\n            innovative operations must be more intensive and accompanied\n            by considerable informal technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia - Private and Financial Sector Policy\n            Based Guarantee Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia -

This program document\n            describes the PFSPBG to the Republic of Serbia to support\n            the Government's structural reform program and mitigate\n            the effects of the global economic crisis. The Policy Based\n            Guarantee (PBG) is of up to EUR 300 million, not exceeding\n            the equivalent of US$400 million. It will cover the\n            principal amount of a commercial loan. The procurement\n            process for the lender to the Government of Serbia (GoS) is\n            in an advanced stage, the lead arranger has been selected by\n            the GoS, and the respective law is scheduled to be submitted\n            to the Parliament for approval upon approval of the PFSPBG\n            by the World Bank board. A policy based guarantee is in\n            light of Serbia's strong track record in macro,\n            structural and social policies, sustainable external\n            financing plan, and coherent
