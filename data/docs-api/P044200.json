Second, that by establishing\n            the think-tank as an independent entity, yet with a\n            governance structure that makes it fully accountable to the\n            government, allows to maintain objectivity of the analysis,\n            and recommendations, while preventing the institution from\n            deviating into researching topics of purely academic\n            significance. The Project shows how important it is to build\n            capacity for quality public policy analysis in the design of\n            an appropriate market model, in how to generate demand, in\n            how to deal with the informational asymmetries that cause\n            inefficient use of resources, and in how to ensure\n            independence and objectivity avoiding political capture of\n            an institution. Third, that for achieving all of the above,\n            the quality oversight of the research on the Bank side plays\n            an important role. It makes supervision labor-intensive\n            because it requires involvement of a broad team of Bank\n            staff in reviewing key analytical products of an\n            institution. Fourth, that long-term financing of\n            institutions, should be based on very solid assumptions,\n            i.e., creating highly professional institutions within the\n            public sector is contingent upon public sector salaries\n            being attractive - often not realistic - thus project design\n            should take into account options that foster public-private partnerships."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia - Bureau of Economic Analysis Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russia -

To meet this\n            objective, the project has three sub-goals: (1) to increase\n            the quantity and quality of cross-sectoral economic policy\n            studies for government use; (2) to establish the BEA outside\n            of but accountable to government, for an objective,\n            economy-wide perspective in assessing economic policy\n            options, and (3) to improve the reliability of the national\n            accounts as a basis for sound economic analysis. The project\n            will finance three components: (1) Policy studies- for local\n            and international consultants, and to obtain data to use in\n            medium-term policy studies focused on macroeconomic analysis\n            and public finance, social policy, and enterprise economics\n            and financial sector reform; for production of the annual\n            report, quarterly indicators, and quick-response policy\n            notes, and for databases to support these initiatives; (2)\n            Bureau of Economic Analysis- for the technical and human\n            resources needed to increase capacity for economic policy\n            analysis both in the BEA and in the core economic\n            ministries, including computer and information technology, a\n            library, on-line databases, and training, study tours, and\n            fellowships;
