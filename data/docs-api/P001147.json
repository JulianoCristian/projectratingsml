The project only\n            partially achieved its objectives, institutional development\n            was negligible, sustainability is uncertain, and the\n            performance of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First, in\n            order to facilitate implementation and supervision, it is\n            advisable to avoid complex projects with a mix of components\n            of different kinds. Also, it is wise to ensure that the\n            responsibilities of all parties involved are well defined\n            and clearly understood. Second, it is essential that project\n            and loan documentation include a clear definition of the\n            project's objectives, performance indicators, and a\n            plan for a mid-term review. Third, a project relying on\n            private sector participation should not be designed without\n            extensive prior consultations with the private sector itself\n            or conclusive evidence that the government is indeed\n            committed to privatization. Fourth, no matter how well\n            designed the instruments might be, a private sector-oriented\n            housing finance system, encompassing the production of plots\n            and construction of houses, cannot be fully successful if\n            the policy environment is not conducive to private sector\n            participation. Finally, the Bank should pay more attention\n            to the continuity of staff working on a project to ensure\n            that the assigned staff has appropriate expertise and\n            essential covenants are enforced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -
