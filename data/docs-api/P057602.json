Some lessons learned included:\n            achieving full cost recovery is a very common objective in\n            Bank funded projects but which is rarely achieved in\n            practice and the present project does not make any\n            difference to that rule. One of the main reasons is that\n            cost recovery highly depend on tariff policy on which bank\n            funded activities have little leverage (except through\n            conditionality's which are rarely enforced). A better\n            objective (and more realistic) could be worded as \"to\n            put in place tariff setting and regulation mechanisms that\n            can allow a full cost recovery of the service\". This\n            Project shows that infrastructure financing is not\n            sufficient to improve service delivery. In weak capacity\n            countries like Yemen, sufficient resources should be\n            allocated for institutional development, capacity building\n            and governance improvement. In addition, the content of the\n            assistance to be provided should be defined as soon as\n            project's preparation (if possible in the form of Terms\n            of Reference) to avoid later resource diversion. The design\n            of a UFW reduction program is a complex process which needs\n            to begin by important preparatory work (update of network\n            maps and customer databases) and tests for loss assessment\n            and locating the defects (leak detection). Commercial losses\n            should also be investigated ~carefully as they may be\n            significant before investing heavily in network\n            replacements. In situations of serious water scarcity,\n            rehabilitation of networks - through replacement of pipes\n            and installation of water meters - is likely to have limited\n            effects as less water is flowing through the pipes. The\n            decline in the water consumption per connection means that\n            increased metering results in less revenues for the\n            utilities, and hence it is likely that the costs of the\n            investments are not covered by the benefits. Expanding\n            networks while the water produced is declining, results in\n            under-used infrastructure, and hence provides only partial\n            benefits. All urban water projects should be closely\n            coordinated with Urban Planning authorities to minimize the\n            risk of project's modification during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Urban Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Adaptable Program Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Urban Water Supply and\n

water\n            supply, and wastewater collection and disposal in the city,\n            to cover a period through 2020. Despite expected\n            overwhelming, positive environmental impacts, the EA\n            identified both major, and secondary environmental issues,\n            proposing mitigation measures as follows. The major issues\n            are: 1) incidence of malaria surrounding water, and\n            sanitation works - the health sector's national malaria\n            program will be supplemented primarily through vector\n            control strategies, targeted at controlling mosquito\n            breeding areas, while, Insecticide Treated Bed-nets (ITB)\n            will also be provided; 2) disposal of dried sewage sludge -\n            the development of a wastewater treatment, and sludge reuse\n            policy will address the long-term solutions needed,\n            following the rehabilitation of lagoons, and water supply\n            systems; and, 3) handling of chemicals during the process of\n            the water system rehabilitation - precautionary clauses will\n            include contractor's responsibility for training\n            workers on chemical handling, and on provision of adequate\n            safety gear, and, a contingency plan will specify measures\n            for spill prevention, and hazardous chemical control. Other\n            measures include soil contamination testing; fencing the\n            surrounding areas to safeguard traffic; appropriate\n            wastewater disposal at selected sites during construction;\n            and, installation of screens, and barriers to abate noise,\n            and air pollution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental impact assessment and\n            management plan for Dhamar"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Municipal Water Project :\n            environmental assessment (Vol. 7) : Environmental impact\n            assessment and management plan for Dhamar"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/08/12882026/yemen-municipal-water-project-environmental-assessment-vol-7-environmental-impact-assessment-management-plan-dhamar","projn":"RY-Urban Wtr Supply & Sanitation Apl -- P057602","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Yemen, Republic of","authors":{"authr":"Dorsch Consult / Gitec Consult"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20101020014142"},"subsc":"Sewerage,Sub-national government administration,Water supply,Other industry","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment;
