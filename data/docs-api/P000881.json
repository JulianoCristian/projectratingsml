The primary objective was to initiate a\n            process of rehabilitation to enable Ministry of Food and\n            Agriculture (MOFA) to provide effective support to\n            agriculture and this would be through strengthening the\n            institutional framework for the formulation and\n            implementation of agricultural policies and programs and\n            improving the delivery of public services in the sector.\n            Corresponding components were: (i) strengthening MOFA's\n            capacity for policy formulation, planning, monitoring and\n            evaluation; (ii) carrying out policy reform, focusing on\n            privatization and divestiture of fertilizer and veterinary\n            drugs distribution, tractor hire services, and other\n            state-owned enterprises in the agriculture sector; and,\n            (iii) improving agricultural support services in research,\n            irrigation and extension. Bank performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrowers performance was satisfactory. The key findings in\n            the project were: (i) a demoralized bureaucracy is slow to\n            respond to efforts to improve its operations, particularly\n            in an environment where macroeconomic reform substantially\n            erodes the buying power of salaries; (ii) Bank's\n            procurement and disbursement procedures require much forward\n            planning and painstaking attention to detail and it takes\n            time to understand firstly, why the procedures are necessary\n            and, secondly, actually make the effort to comply with them;\n            the situation is worsened if there is no direct benefit\n            accruing to individuals involved; (iii) having gained\n            training and experience, staff become more marketable as an\n            economy liberalizes and are likely to move out of the public\n            sector and therefore affect sustainability of activities\n            supported under the project: and (iv) institutions which are\n            being strengthened through a learning-by-doing process need\n            a longer time to implement activities and projects\n            identified for this purpose."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Agricultural Services Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Agricultural Services\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/05/733913/ghana-agricultural-services-rehabilitation-project","projn":"GH-Agric Serv.
