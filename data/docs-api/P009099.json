The institutional\n            development impact for the Emergency Earthquake Recovery\n            Project is substantial, while the other two projects\n            received ratings of modest for this aspect. Lessons for\n            disaster recovery suggested by the experience of these\n            projects included: 1) The support the Bank promptly provided\n            enabled people to survive, put funds into the economy, and\n            was reported as highly preferable to in-kind support by\n            beneficiaries. 2)  Greater accuracy of damage assessments is\n            still needed to avoid unnecessary construction. 3)\n            Addressing the social and economic recovery aspects of\n            emergency projects, although difficult, is critical for the\n            sustainability of the reconstruction investments. 4)\n            Creating New Disaster Management Institutions takes more\n            time than is available under one project. 5) Cash Transfer\n            projects can make an extremely important contribution to\n            recovery. Getting cash support to victims quickly positively\n            affected the economy and perhaps even affected people's\n            sense of safety and security. It was a prominent first sign\n            of the government's support in a time of acute need."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Erzincan Earthquake Rehabilitation\n            and Reconstruction Project, Turkey Emergency Flood and\n            Earthquake Recovery Project, and Emergency Earthquake\n            Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Erzincan Earthquake\n            Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, Turkey Emergency\n            Flood and Earthquake Recovery Project, and Emergency\n            Earthquake Recovery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6067987/turkey-erzincan-earthquake-rehabilitation-reconstruction-project-turkey-emergency-flood-earthquake-recovery-project-emergency-earthquake-recovery-project","projn":"TR-Emergency Earthquake Recovery Loan (Eerl)\n            -- P068394,TR-Earthquake Rehabilitation &\n            Reconstruction Project -- P009099,TR-Emergency Flood & Earthquake Recovery\n            Project -- P058877","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050715144818"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Irrigation and drainage,Housing construction,General public administration sector,Roads and highways,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General industry and trade sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actions, apartments, Bank management, Bank\n            Performance, beneficiaries, casualties, cities, collapsed\n            buildings, construction industry, cooperative housing, cost\n            of capital, crime, damage assessment, development\n            objectives, disaster assistance, disaster emergencies,\n            Disaster Insurance, Disaster Management, disaster\n            preparedness, disaster recovery, Disaster Rehabilitation,\n            Disasters, displaced persons, dwellings, Earthquake\n            Reconstruction, earthquakes, EIB, Emergencies, Emergency\n            Management, Emergency Recovery, Emergency Recovery Loan,\n            engineers, Epidemiology, fatalities, Fiscal Year,\n            flexibility, flood control, flood protection, flooding,\n            floods, hospitals, houses, Housing, Housing Development,\n            housing units, human settlements, injuries, Institutional\n            Development, Insurance, insurance industry, Landslides,\n            living conditions, municipalities, Natural Disasters,\n            natural hazards, natural resources, neighborhoods, nurses,\n            Operations, peer review, Private housing, project cycle,\n            Project Implementation, public buildings, quality at entry,\n            rates, rural areas, safety, Savings, schools, Settlement,\n            shelter, Social Issues, stakeholders, supervision,\n            supervision costs, Sustainability, technical assistance,\n            urban housing, vandalism, victims, water supply"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE),Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF022839-GERMAN JPO-MR.

However, there\n            were several problems during the first three years of the\n            project with the selection and work of the consultants who\n            assisted Housing Development Administration with design and\n            construction supervision for the four main construction\n            components. These difficulties significantly contributed to\n            the initial implementation delays. Furthermore, there was\n            poor government commitment to the institutional components\n            attempting to strengthen Turkey's preparedness for\n            future earthquakes. The lessons learned from this project\n            include: 1) Give preventive and institutional development\n            measures a more prominent role. 2) Maintain reasonable\n            Quality at Entry even for urgent projects. 3) Local\n            involvement is key to success. 4) Seek to limit the number\n            of sectors included. 5) Avoid extensions. It would have been\n            better to close the project in 1996 and identify new\n            operations in response to future disasters on the basis of\n            the merits of those cases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
