These ratings result from the fact that the\n            objectives of restoring macroeconomic stability, improving\n            public sector management, and shielding the poor from the\n            transitional impact of adjustment, were not met. As for\n            institutional development impacts, the project targeted\n            reforms in the parastatal sector, where results were\n            disappointing. Furthermore, the 1998-2000 period has been\n            one of macroeconomic destabilization, with slippages in\n            structural reforms, and forcible land acquisition, which has\n            destroyed private sector confidence, and the core of\n            efficient agriculture. Although the Bank correctly focused\n            on liberalizing the economy, constraining parastatal losses,\n            and on agricultural marketing reforms, it overestimated\n            Government ownership of this project's reforms, and\n            underestimated the risk to stabilization, and to private\n            sector confidence. In addition, early analytic work to\n            assist in public expenditure management was not planned, and\n            the social impact of reforms not monitored. Regrettably, the\n            Borrower, following 1997, reversed many of the reforms\n            already implemented under the project. Lessons suggest a\n            public expenditure review should have been undertaken early\n            on; political dialogue and consensus built, rather than\n            relying on commitments; and, tranche releases should be\n            based on results, taking into account that poverty reduction\n            is paramount in adjustment operations, particularly in\n            low-income countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Second Structural Adjustment\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zimbabwe - Second Structural\n            Adjustment Credit

- Second Structural Adjustment\n            Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Second Structural Adjustment Credit\n            for Zimbabwe achieved a satisfactory overall outcome.\n            Substantial progress was achieved in improving the business\n            environment by reforming the exchange rate and trade regime,\n            deregulating foreign and local investment, and liberalizing\n            markets. However, the fiscal deficit was not brought down;\n            deficits led to high nominal and real interest rates; the\n            private sector was crowded out from domestic credit;\n            increasing public debt service constrained allocations for\n            the social sectors; and there was inadequate employment\n            creation and poverty reduction. Program sustainability is\n            rated as uncertain. Further progress is needed in\n            expenditure rationalization, revenue enhancement, and asset\n            and liability management. It will be necessary to foster a\n            more equitable distribution of reform program benefits to\n            maintain public support. Bank performance is rated as\n            satisfactory, although noted issues include the operation\n            design, economic strategy, and lack of explicit conditions\n            on social sector spending. Borrower performance is rated as\n            satisfactory in preparation and early implementation, but\n            became uneven in later stages. Performance was poor in\n            fiscal management; coordination of monetary, fiscal,\n            exchange rate policies; and covenant compliance. The primary\n            lesson learned is that, while the structural reform elements\n            of the project were largely achieved and produced the\n            expected results, such reforms cannot be fully effective in\n            unstable macroeconomic conditions. Other lessons learned\n            include: there is a need to link the adjustment operation\n            more explicitly to the Bank's poverty reduction\n            strategy; the ultimate success of the program will rely on\n            the confidence of the private sector and civil society; and\n            the systematic monitoring of the impact of reforms could\n            have been more strongly supported as a condition for an\n            adjustment operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Second Structural Adjustment\n            Credit

      second phase of Zimbabwe's structural adjustment\n            program. Given good progress in the first phase of the\n            program and taking into account the effects of the 1992\n            drought, this support is appropriate and in line with the\n            Bank's assistance strategy for Zimbabwe. The credit\n            focuses on generating more rapid supply response, while\n            continuing efforts to restore macroeconomic stability,\n            improve public sector management and shield poor and\n            vulnerable groups from harsh transitional effects arising\n            from adjustment. To achieve the rapid increase in investment\n            and exports which are vital to the sustainability and\n            success of structural adjustment in Zimbabawe, the credit\n            will support: (a) further trade policy reform to promote\n            exports; (b) investment delicensing to facilitate an\n            increase in private investment; and (c) agricultural\n            marketing and price reform to broaden private sector\n            involvement and competition."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe - Second Structural Adjustment\n            Credit
