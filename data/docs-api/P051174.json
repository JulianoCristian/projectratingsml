Some lessons learned included:\n            the project design included disbursement triggers on the\n            credit and grant. The triggers were linked to the overall\n            healthcare restructuring and reform objectives, which\n            provided relatively strong incentives to the government to\n            pursue the overall objectives of the project. Close\n            coordination with development partners to ensure coherence\n            and complementarities of activities is critical.\n            Stakeholders' involvement throughout project\n            implementation is crucial. Local empowerment for planning\n            and implementing locally developed plans to compete for HIF\n            funding resulted in greater ownership, commitment and\n            transparency. Communication, information dissemination, and\n            capacity building played a significant role in the\n            successful implementation of any project and this project\n            was no exception. A focus on identifying problems and\n            seeking solutions as a coherent, collaborative Bank-client\n            team is important for achieving results. Lastly, the\n            indicators need to be measurable, reliable and reflect\n            development objectives. There should be a clear distinction\n            between output indicators and outcome indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Health Investment Fund
