the transmission and distribution system of the Shaba\n            region to minimize the risk of failure of the supply of\n            energy to the mining industry and particularly to Gecamines.\n            Subsequent maintenance will be supported under the project\n            by provision of vehicles, small equipment and spare parts,\n            and a reserve for unforeseen repairs. SNEL's financial\n            management and its planning, operating, and maintenance\n            capabilities will be strengthened by the services of\n            long-term technical experts. The Shaba Power System\n            Rehabilitation Project will also include the services of\n            consultants for project implementation; energy policy\n            formulation; and studies of training needs and the\n            electricity tariff structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Shaba Power System Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire - Shaba Power System\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/03/726021/zaire-shaba-power-system-rehabilitation-project","projn":"ZR-Rehab.Shaba Pwr.Syst -- P003036","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912540036"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,air travel,barrels of\n            oil,charcoal,Coal,coal reserves,Coal\n            Resources,construction,cooling,cooling systems,cost of\n            electricity,covers,crude oil,Debt,Demand for\n            Electricity,demand for energy,diesel fuel,distribution of\n            electricity,domestic use,drilling,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,efficient use,electric power,electrical\n            energy,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            demand,Electricity production,employment,Energy\n            Balance,Energy Demand,energy needs,energy output,energy\n            policies,energy prices,Energy Pricing,Energy\n            Production,Energy Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            sources,energy usage,Engineering,engineering\n            services,exchange rate,expenditures,fire,fuel\n            oil,fuelwood,generator,growth in demand,hand tools,heavy\n            crude,Hydro Power,hydroelectric\n            power,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,interest\n            rates,kerosene,lending rates,Measurements,mines,natural\n            gas,offshore oil,offshore oil fields,oil\n            equivalent,OPEC,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,petroleum\n            products,power companies,power supply,Power System,price of\n            energy,production facilities,production of energy,proven\n            reserves,rainfall,refined products,reservoirs,rural\n            electrification,safety,solar energy,Supply of\n            Power,technicians,total consumption,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to electricity,air travel,barrels of\n            oil,charcoal,Coal,coal reserves,Coal\n            Resources,construction,cooling,cooling systems,cost of\n            electricity,covers,crude oil,Debt,Demand for\n            Electricity,demand for energy,diesel fuel,distribution of\n            electricity,domestic use,drilling,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,efficient use,electric power,electrical\n            energy,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            demand,Electricity production,employment,Energy\n            Balance,Energy Demand,energy needs,energy output,energy\n            policies,energy prices,Energy Pricing,Energy\n            Production,Energy Resources,ENERGY SECTOR,energy\n            sources,energy usage,Engineering,engineering\n            services,exchange rate,expenditures,fire,fuel\n            oil,fuelwood,generator,growth in demand,hand tools,heavy\n            crude,Hydro Power,hydroelectric\n            power,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,interest\n            rates,kerosene,lending rates,Measurements,mines,natural\n            gas,offshore oil,offshore oil fields,oil\n            equivalent,OPEC,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,petroleum\n            products,power companies,power supply,Power System,price of\n            energy,production facilities,production of energy,proven\n            reserves,rainfall,refined products,reservoirs,rural\n            electrification,safety,solar energy,Supply of\n            Power,technicians,total consumption,Water Supply"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"3400"},"facets":{}}}
