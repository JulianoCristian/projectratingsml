The Sugar Industry Restructuring and\n            Privatization Project in Guyana. In 1990, the Bank's\n            Country Assistance Strategy for Guyana emphasized the need\n            for reducing severe fiscal and external imbalances and\n            encouraging private sector development. The project sought\n            to maintain sugar production at its present level, with the\n            unstated goal of restoring Guyana's ability to fill its\n            export quota with the European Union. It also sought to\n            ensure the technical and financial viability of the industry\n            through restructuring and privatization of Guyana Sugar\n            Company (GUYSUCO). The project's components consisted\n            of (a) a two-year capital investment program and (b)\n            technical assistance to prepare GUYSUCO for privatization.\n            The project outcome was unsatisfactory. Both preparation\n            assistance and International Development Association (IDA)\n            appraisal were rated deficient. Borrower\u2019s performance was\n            very sound. The key lessons to be learned from the project\n            are as follows: (a) the justification for committing scarce\n            IDA resources to privatization projects needs to be examined\n            closely; (b) IDA efforts to support privatization should\n            more appropriately be part of an Adjustment and Policy\n            Reform Operation with TA instead of an investment project;\n            (c) bringing publicly-owned enterprises under private\n            management may lead to large efficiency gains; and (d) a\n            privatization strategy needs to be properly sequenced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Sugar Industry Restructuring and\n            Privatization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - Sugar Industry\n            Restructuring and Privatization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731919/guyana-sugar-industry-restructuring-privatization-project","projn":"GY-Sugar Rhb & Priv -- P007260","subtopic":"Municipal Financial Management,Banks & Banking Reform,Non Bank Financial Institutions,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Water and Industry","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Water Resources","count":"Guyana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970909142305"},"theme":"State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Regulation and competition policy","subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Urban Development,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,assets,assurance,auditing,capital\n            expenditures,competitiveness,debt,effluent\n            treatment,financial management,financial performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,government support,Institutional\n            development,labor unions,market discipline,Natural\n            Resources,operating costs,present value,private\n            placement,Privatization,productivity,project\n            management,regulatory framework,rents,State\n            Enterprises,Subsidiary,Sugar Industry,technical assistance,valuation,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,assets,assurance,auditing,capital\n            expenditures,competitiveness,debt,effluent\n            treatment,financial management,financial performance,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,government support,Institutional\n            development,labor unions,market discipline,Natural\n            Resources,operating costs,present value,private\n            placement,Privatization,productivity,project\n            management,regulatory framework,rents,State\n            Enterprises,Subsidiary,Sugar Industry,technical assistance,valuation,wages"}},"owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF021404-SUGAR INDUST.

The project comprises two components:\n            capital investment in priority operating factory equipment\n            and machinery to stabilize sugar production at the present\n            rate; and technical assistance in the form of financial\n            advisory and management services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Sugar Industry Restructuring and\n            Privatization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - Sugar Industry\n            Restructuring and Privatization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/08/734694/guyana-sugar-industry-restructuring-privatization-project","projn":"GY-Sugar Rhb & Priv -- P007260","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Water and Industry,Agribusiness & Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Rural Development,Water Resources,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Guyana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961004061542"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Rural Development,Water Resources,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural inputs,agricultural\n            practices,agricultural sector,Agriculture,arable\n            areas,Audits,autonomy,balance of payments,bilateral\n            donors,capital budgeting,capital requirements,clay\n            soils,commercial bank debt,consumer subsidies,corporate\n            taxes,debt,dumping,Economic activity,economic\n            growth,Economic Justification,economic life,Economic\n            Performance,economic policies,economic problems,Economic\n            Rate of Return,employment,Exchange\n            Rate,exports,farmers,financial risk,financing sources,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fisheries,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,imports,inflation,interest\n            rates,international reserves,irrigation water,labor\n            force,macroeconomic policy,mills,natural\n            environment,ownership structure,policy\n            environment,population density,potential investors,price\n            controls,price declines,price\n            levels,Privatization,production\n            costs,productivity,PROFITABILITY,public\n            enterprises,pumps,quota prices,Quotas,real GDP,Regulatory\n            Framework,savings,soil moisture,state enterprises,state\n            intervention,Structural Adjustment,subsidiary,Sugar,Sugar\n            Industry,Sugar Prices,sugar refining,tax reform,Technical\n            Assistance,timber,total output,trade unions,treasury\n            bills,valuation,value added,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural inputs,agricultural\n            practices,agricultural sector,Agriculture,arable\n            areas,Audits,autonomy,balance of payments,bilateral\n            donors,capital budgeting,capital requirements,clay\n            soils,commercial bank debt,consumer subsidies,corporate\n            taxes,debt,dumping,Economic activity,economic\n            growth,Economic Justification,economic life,Economic\n            Performance,economic policies,economic problems,Economic\n            Rate of Return,employment,Exchange\n            Rate,exports,farmers,financial risk,financing sources,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fisheries,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,imports,inflation,interest\n            rates,international reserves,irrigation water,labor\n            force,macroeconomic policy,mills,natural\n            environment,ownership structure,policy\n            environment,population density,potential investors,price\n            controls,price declines,price\n            levels,Privatization,production\n            costs,productivity,PROFITABILITY,public\n            enterprises,pumps,quota prices,Quotas,real GDP,Regulatory\n            Framework,savings,soil moisture,state enterprises,state\n            intervention,Structural Adjustment,subsidiary,Sugar,Sugar\n            Industry,Sugar Prices,sugar refining,tax reform,Technical\n            Assistance,timber,total output,trade unions,treasury\n            bills,valuation,value added,wages"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development Dept (LCSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF021414-PHRD-SUGAR IND.
