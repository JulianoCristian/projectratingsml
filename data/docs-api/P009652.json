Since effectiveness there\n            had been slow progress in implementation, from the setting\n            up of training centers to the prequalification for the\n            purchase of aircrafts. The Borrower made satisfactory\n            progress in preparation for the commencement of lending\n            operations for private operators. Two supervision missions\n            in May and October 1971 reported that difficulties were\n            encountered in getting the training program underway due to\n            administrative delays and cumbersome bureaucratic\n            procedures. The report implies that, since a lack of\n            domestic commitment to the project was obvious from the\n            beginning, there were substantial shortcomings in Bank\n            performance. In February 1971, the Government informed the\n            Bank that as a result of the war on the sub-continent, a\n            general directive to re-examine foreign exchange priorities\n            had been issued. The use of foreign exchange for crop\n            spraying was questioned. In June 1972, the Government also\n            proposed in alterations to the project to permit\n            indigenously produced aircraft to compete in procurement.\n            The Bank rejected this proposal and the Government did not\n            agree to revert to the original specifications until June\n            1973. In September 1973, the Government requested to\n            transfer the training program from the Department of\n            Agriculture to the Directorate of Civil Aviation. The Bank\n            agreed, but wanted to see the details of the proposal.\n            Another supervision mission in December 1973 was still\n            unable to obtain documentation of progress. Finally, on June\n            21, 1974, the Government informed the Bank that its\n            priorities had changed and requested cancellation of the\n            credit. The Board cancelled the loan on August 13, 1974. The\n            loan was never disbursed and is, therefore, not rated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Agricultural Aviation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Agricultural Aviation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/06/734191/india-agricultural-aviation-project","projn":"IN-Agricultural-Aviatio -- P009652","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Country Strategy & Performance,Agricultural Research,Airports and Air Services,Teaching and Learning,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Transport","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961006201648"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other agriculture","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accident,Agriculture,aircraft,aircrafts,Aviation,Bank\n            performance,Bank supervision,Civil Aviation,commercial\n            banks,Country Department,foreign exchange,private\n            aviation,Regional Office,training centers"},"1":{"cdata!":"accident,Agriculture,aircraft,aircrafts,Aviation,Bank\n            performance,Bank supervision,Civil Aviation,commercial\n            banks,Country Department,foreign exchange,private\n            aviation,Regional Office,training centers"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"13217"},"722543":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1970/10/722543/india-agricultural-aviation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1970/10/722543/india-agricultural-aviation-project","new_url":"1970/10/722543/india-agricultural-aviation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/15/000178830_98101903201630/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/06/15/000178830_98101903201630/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"0230","datestored":"2000-06-15T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1970-10-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - Agricultural Aviation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Agricultural Aviation Project will\n            support a program of aerial spraying which began in 1957 and\n            will complement other IDA assistance to India in the\n            agricultural sector.
