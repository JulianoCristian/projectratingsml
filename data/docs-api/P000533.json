Initial supervision missions were\n            understaffed, and inattentive to difficulties, which despite\n            improvements in the later phases of supervision, resulted in\n            an unsatisfactory Bank performance. Similarly, failure to\n            establish appropriate management systems, and the weak\n            results of physical components, assesses an unsatisfactory\n            Borrower performance. Lessons show the delicate balance of\n            implementing agencies in handling large amounts, and\n            different types of work, under weak capacity situations, and\n            lack of experience. The Agence Tchadienne d'Execution\n            de Travaux d'Interet Public (ATETIP) committed itself\n            to an extraordinary amount of projects, and the new Agence\n            d'Execution de Travaux d'Interet Public (AGETIP),\n            proved inexperienced, particularly with the introduction of\n            private contracting practices into prevailing government\n            administration experience. This clearly demands intensive\n            technical assistance, to build capacity, which should\n            include a careful assessment of staff with private sector\n            experience. Also, the specialized nature of delegated\n            contract management, require adequate supervision to conduct\n            financial, and technical reviews, able to identify, and\n            remedy problematic subprojects, prior to implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad -
