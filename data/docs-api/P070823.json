Malawi\u2019s poverty reduction\n            strategies identified the enhancement of human capital as\n            one of Malawi's formidable challenges. In response to\n            these challenges, the International Development\n            Association\u2019s approach included training of primary school\n            teachers, provision of materials to secondary teachers and\n            training of university lecturers at various levels. The\n            project engaged the communities through the participation of\n            parent-teacher associations in the procurement of learning\n            materials, organization of school feeding programs, and\n            promotion of good health and nutrition practices. As a\n            result, children were reached with interventions, which\n            included distribution of Vitamin A and iron, folic acid,\n            de-worming, treatment of malaria and fever, and promotion of\n            good health and nutrition practices.  The project improved\n            learning through supply of basic learning materials to\n            schools while strengthening the participation of communities\n            in school management. At the primary level a new training\n            college was constructed for primary teachers to increase the\n            number of trained teachers annually.

Some lessons learned included:\n            despite the sector needs and desire to address identified\n            issues, realistic planning and budgeting is always important\n            for successful and quality project implementation. The\n            project scope had to be reduced substantially due to\n            financial constraints. Education strategic plans are vital\n            to the realization of effective donor coordination. They\n            provide for a strategic approach to managing sector\n            investments while consolidating national ownership for\n            programs and projects. Support to policy and strategic plans\n            development together with training and baseline surveys,\n            yielded more long-lasting results including reforms in the\n            institutional framework which had not been anticipated and\n            contrary to normal practice. This could be attributed to the\n            high Government commitment to reforms and its worth\n            replicating elsewhere. Timely recruitment of project staff\n            is essential for effective project implementation. Critical\n            staffs were recruited mid-way through project implementation\n            which led to delays in the implementation of some\n            components.

Component\n            4) will supply basic learning materials directly to schools\n            while strengthening the participation of communities in\n            school management. Component 5) Capacity Building and Policy\n            Development will cover: (i) national education policy\n            consolidation and capacity building; and (ii) support to\n            implementation of government decentralization policy in\n            education.

Social impacts\n            are likely to occur during the construction and\n            rehabilitation of educational facilities. When\n            rehabilitating community day secondary schools, the\n            Polytechnic Institute, and the Chancellor College, take care\n            during the screening process to identify all possible land\n            uses, for example, crop production or grazing at these\n            facilities to ensure compensation. No social impacts are\n            likely when Mzuzu University is rehabilitated. When building\n            the Teacher Training College, social impacts may occur with\n            land use changes along with the need to acquire land to\n            accommodate building power distribution lines to connect the\n            campus to the grid. Regarding the development and use of\n            borrow pits as sources of construction materials, potential\n            impacts include loss of access to economic activities and\n            loss of livelihoods due to the need for land acquisition to\n            develop new borrow pits.
