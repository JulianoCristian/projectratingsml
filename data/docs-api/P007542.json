Many of the productive components failed\n            to become operative or operated poorly, mostly because of\n            inadequate beneficiary participation and poor extension and\n            agricultural credit services. By contrast, production\n            support and social programs performed relatively well. The\n            project was more successful in achieving its\n            institution-building objectives, by creating a decentralized\n            framework through which the problems of rural poverty in\n            Mexico could be addressed more effectively. The project was\n            the continuation of a national rural development program and\n            consisted of: (i) directly productive components: livestock,\n            small-scale irrigation, soil and water conservation, fruit\n            production, rural industries; and agricultural credit; (ii)\n            production support components: feeder roads, rural\n            electrification, agricultural extension, farmers\n            organizations and rural markets; and (iii) social\n            infrastructure: education facilities and water supply. A\n            number of lessons have been drawn from this project and\n            recently applied in new rural development projects in\n            Mexico: (a) the project was over-ambitious and too dispersed\n            geographically. Coordination between numerous line agencies\n            responsible for project execution proved more difficult than\n            anticipated. (b) The project confirmed the findings of other\n            complex rural development projects in Mexico (Papaloapan\n            Basin and Tropical Agriculture, OED Reports 5760 and 5997 of\n            June and December 1985) that a series of smaller projects,\n            implemented by different line agencies, might be more\n            effective than one large, multidisciplinary project. (c)\n            Heavy Bank supervision (four man-years) was effective in\n            detecting promptly the major shortcoming so f the project,\n            but was unable to bring about changes to remedy these\n            shortcomings; and (d) the early establishment of an\n            effective monitoring and evaluation system is crucial for\n            this kind of project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
