The major lesson for similar operations is\n            that budget support for institutional reforms should only be\n            used with strong and mature country systems, and with\n            greater emphasis on knowledge transfer and strengthening\n            analytical capacity. Although the operation ensured resource\n            transfers and helped jump start the reform process,\n            knowledge transfer is becoming a bottleneck in the\n            implementation at the state level. Despite the lengthy and\n            comprehensive design period, the development of the State\n            Strategic Statistical Plan (SSSPs) has turned out to be a\n            more difficult task for most of the states and only a few of\n            the most advanced have managed to produce good quality\n            strategic documents. The implementation of the strategies is\n            also much more challenging task and even the most advanced\n            states will require support in how to do the changes,\n            particularly in terms of sharing good practices and lessons.\n            Given the experience gained so far, the design of the\n            program might also be strengthened by incorporating\n            intermediate steps between the actions and the final\n            outcomes in the policy matrix. Currently there is a big gap\n            in the matrix between the initial process steps, covered in\n            the loan period (2010), and the expected outcomes in 2015.\n            Setting out the trajectory of the delivery chain from the\n            start, including the intermediate milestones, could help\n            Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MOSPI)\n            better manage the pace and path of the reforms. By flexibly\n            managing the trajectory on an ongoing basis MOSPI might be\n            better equipped to adjust to delays, exogenous shocks and\n            other factors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Statistical Strengthening Loan Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Statistical Strengthening Loan\n            Program supports an institution and policy based reform of\n            Government of India for strengthening the state statistical\n            systems within a national policy framework. The four main\n            policy areas which the operation supports are: (I)\n            strengthening the institutions of leadership and\n            coordination of the National Statistical System - this\n            policy area addresses the deterioration in coordination and\n            organizational functioning over the past few decades that\n            has reduced the effectiveness of the Indian Statistical\n            System (ISS); (II) improving and increasing the support from\n            the Central Government and the Ministry of Statistics to the\n            statistical systems of State/Union Territories (UTs) - the\n            support being provided to states is in two main areas:\n            first, a process to establish standards, norms and\n            benchmarks for key statistical activities that contribute to\n            important national data series; and second, technical and\n            financial support for the implementation of the reforms;\n            (III) strengthening the capacity and performance of the\n            statistical systems in a majority of States/UTs in India -\n            the 2001 National Statistical Commission (NSC) Report noted\n            that the failure of the ISS stems from a deterioration in\n            the state statistical systems as a whole, so participation\n            of the states in the reform program is critical and the\n            policy area focuses on integrating the states into the\n            national statistical system through a centrally sponsored\n            scheme; and (IV) improving the coverage, quality, timeliness\n            and credibility of statistics generated by States and UTs -\n            this policy area places emphasis on improvements in the\n            timeliness, coverage, accuracy, consistency and usefulness\n            of the statistics produced by states because the 2001 report\n            observed that over time there has been a decline in the\n            quality and reliability of statistics generated by state\n            statistical systems and data gaps and duplication were\n            leading to conflicting statistics and inordinate delays in\n            transmission and publication of data."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Statistical Strengthening Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Statistical Strengthening\n            Loan Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/04/12228693/india-statistical-strengthening-loan-program","projn":"IN-India First Statistical Strengthening\n            Project -- P108489","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Technology Industry,Corporate Law,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Industry,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100511021138"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,Industry,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"availability of data, Bank Involvement,\n            beneficiary, Borrower, business confidence, capital flows,\n            Contact point, contribution, credit supports, economic\n            activity, economic development, Economic growth, economic\n            policy, economic reforms, Estate, farmers, financial\n            resource, global economy, households, ID, implementation\n            strategy, Implementing Agency, inflation, informed\n            decisions, investment activity, investment climate, job\n            creation, limited, market constraints, private investment,\n            private investments, private sector, private sector\n            investment, private sector participation, productivity,\n            public administration, public investments, result, results,\n            risk mitigation, savings, secondary education, senior,\n            social services, society, stakeholders, targets, technical\n            support, telecommunications, Telephone, Union, village, Web"}},"owner":"Econ.
