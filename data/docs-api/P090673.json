Some lessons learned includes: strong\n            analytic work, leveraged through good cross-sectoral\n            cooperation and piggybacking the work used for the\n            development policy credit, the PRSC, were crucial to solid\n            project design. A commitment to results-based management by\n            the Bank, the co-financier, and the Government, enhanced\n            positive project outcomes. Strong Government ownership,\n            supplemented by strong implementation by the implementing\n            agencies and support by an experienced fiduciary agent\n            (CAPMU), were the cornerstones of project success and low\n            sustainability risk. A proactive approach and flexibility by\n            both the Bank and Government to adapt to changing\n            circumstances and arising issues of political, financial and\n            environmental nature were critical for project success. The\n            Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP) experience in\n            piloting projects aimed at increasing resilience to climate\n            variability has also provided a clear lesson that the best\n            stimulant for widespread adoption of new or additional\n            technologies is demonstration of benefits.  Finally, a\n            failure to introduce leasing as an alternative financial\n            instrument, as originally envisaged in the Project Appraisal\n            Document (PAD), was a missed

of the Second\n            Rural Investment and Services Project for Moldova is to\n            provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural\n            recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and\n            rural sectors can play their full role in providing the\n            underpinnings for future income growth and poverty\n            reduction. The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013. While the original\n            project was approved in 2006 in the amount of US$16.00\n            million, The 2008 additional financing was made available\n            following a disastrous 2007 drought that resulted in a\n            nearly 80 percent loss of the country's crops. The\n            resources were provided for targeted investments for the\n            rehabilitation of small-scale on-farm irrigation systems,\n            and for dissemination of knowledge to farmers on techniques\n            for adaptation to drought. The 2009 additional financing was\n            made available to assist the Government of Moldova in\n            staving off the impact of the global economic downturn on\n            the country's rural economy by securing additional\n            long-term credit resources in order to avoid a contraction\n            of commercial lending to rural businesses, at a time when\n            the original project's credit line was nearly fully\n            disbursed. The project continues to make satisfactory\n            progress towards the achievement of the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). Approximately 85 percent of the overall\n            project resources were disbursed as of March 31, 2012. In\n            light of this, the project was restructured in October, 2011\n            to expand the eligibility of subprojects eligible for\n            financing under this source from on-farm irrigation\n            equipment only, to financing a wider array of\n            faster-disbursing, rural-based investments eligible under\n            the rural finance component. The extension is necessary to\n            allow for additional time for the absorption of resources\n            from the International Development Association (IDA), under\n            the project's rural finance component, in order to\n            provide additional credit resources to potential\n            beneficiaries in an amount nearing US$4.5 million. The\n            extension will allow the restructuring undertaken in\n            October, 2011 to have a more meaningful effect by covering a\n            full agricultural season. This will be the second extension\n            of the project. The first extension of the closing date from\n            June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2012 was required when the IDA was\n            made available as an additional financing in 2009."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - Second Rural Investment\n            and Services Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/04/16226807/moldova-second-rural-investment-services-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"MD-Rural Investment & Services Project\n            (Apl #2) -- P090673","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Access to Finance,Financial Intermediation,Debt Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Moldova","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120416011925"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Other social services,General public administration sector,General industry and trade sector,General finance sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"advisory services, Bank policies,\n            beneficiaries, binding constraint, Borrower, business\n            development, capacity building, commercial lending, credit\n            associations, credit line, credit products, disbursement,\n            disbursements, drought, entrepreneurs, equipment, farm\n            irrigation, farmers, Finance Services, Financial\n            Intermediary, Financial Markets, financial services,\n            financings, ID, income, income growth, International\n            Development, investment projects, legal ownership, poverty\n            reduction, privatization, public spending, remittances,\n            Rural, rural business, rural businesses, rural economy,\n            rural entrepreneurs, Rural Finance, rural finance\n            activities, Rural Investment, rural sectors, savings, tax,\n            term credit"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Development (ECSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF054222-Moldova - Youth Socio-Economic\n            Empowerment through Inclusive Business D,TF054603-PHRD-MOLDOVA: RURAL INVESTMENT\n            AND SERVICES PROJECT (RISP) PHASE II,TF057211-TFESSD: RURAL HAZARD MITIGATION\n            AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGY,TF057273-SUPPORT TO THE SECOND RURAL\n            INVESTMENT AND SERVICES PROJECT IN MOLDOVA-,TF099549-GRANT FOR SECOND RURAL\n            INVESTMENT & SERVICES PROJECT","repnb":"67714"},"16226810":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/04/16226810/moldova-second-rural-investment-services-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/04/16226810/moldova-second-rural-investment-services-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","new_url":"2012/04/16226810/moldova-second-rural-investment-services-project-restructuring-vol-2-2-data-sheet","disclosure_date":"2012-04-13T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-04-13T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-04-13T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/04/16/000386194_20120416012435/Rendered/INDEX/677140v20PJPR00ucturing0Data0sheet.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/04/16/000386194_20120416012435/Rendered/PDF/677140v20PJPR00ucturing0Data0sheet.pdf","credit_no":"Q523;4157;4416;4563;H211","docdt":"2012-04-10T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2012-04-16T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"2","repnme":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Second Rural Investment and\n            Services Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the Second\n            Rural Investment and Services Project for Moldova is to\n            provide long-term support to accelerate agricultural\n            recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and\n            rural sectors can play their full role in providing the\n            underpinnings for future income growth and poverty\n            reduction.
