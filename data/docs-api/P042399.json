The project's success was\n            attributed to the following: 1) Careful selection of the\n            team members of the implementation unit team (PIU) and\n            insisting on keeping the team as compact as possible with no\n            changes in the team during the entire project period. 2)\n            Arrangements for adequate training of the PIU team\n            immediately after the project's approval and before the\n            real start of the project. 3) The members of the\n            implementation unit team should be released from any other\n            obligations at the company, allowing them to devote their\n            time fully to the projects tasks and their successful\n            implementation. 4) At the beginning of the project, the PIU\n            team should be fully organized and equipped with all\n            necessary technical goods, such as adequate office space,\n            phones, fax and copy machines, printers, cameras, car, and a\n            stable, fast Internet connection, etc. 5) The contacts\n            between PIU members and Contractors should be as frequent as\n            possible, if not daily. 6) The contacts between PIU members\n            and the Bank Team Leader or his representative should be\n            more frequent then regular Bank's missions. This could\n            improve the overall project performance and support all\n            necessary discussions about all pending issues on the\n            project and its implementation. 7) This project reinforces\n            the lesson that worthwhile projects take considerable time\n            to complete and rushing them greatly increases the chances\n            of failure. This project took 7 years from start to\n            completion -- as planned. If it had been a five year project\n            it would have had to be extended or would not have been\n            anywhere near as successful."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Power System Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Power System\n            Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6537815/macedonia-power-system-improvement-project","projn":"MK-Power System Improvement Project -- P042399","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Water and Energy,Economic Theory & Research,Dams and Reservoirs,Technology Industry","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Water Resources,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060117114252"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Industry,Water Resources,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ACTUAL COST, ACTUAL COSTS, civil works,\n            Climate change, Components, consumers, dam, dam safety, East\n            Europe, Economic Rate of Return, electrical equipment,\n            equipment, exchange rates, financial covenants, FORMER\n            YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF, hardware, Hydro Plant, hydro power,\n            Hydro Power Plant, hydro power plants, hydroelectric\n            generation, hydropower capacity, hydropower generation,\n            Hydropower Plant, hydropower plants, Institutional\n            Development, large hydropower, legislation, local\n            government, LRMC, MACEDONIA, Marginal Cost, marginal costs,\n            new entrants, operating costs, operating efficiency,\n            potential output, Power Plant, power stations, private\n            funding, private sector, privatization, profitability,\n            reservoirs, savings, small hydropower, technical assistance,\n            telecommunications, turbine, turbine generators, turbines,\n            water flow"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF029479-PHRD-POWER SYSTEM OPERATION\n            IMPROVEMENT PROJ.,TF033790-MACEDONIA - POWER SECTOR IMPROVEMENT,TF033806-MACEDONIA - ENERGY, POWER,TF033840-MACEDONIA - ENERGY,TF035272-MACEDONIA - MINI-HYDROPOWER PROJECT,TF036460-FMR YUGOSLAV REP.
