Some lessons learned includes:\n            outcomes and indicators that measure those outcomes should\n            be closely linked to prior actions and triggers. Whereas\n            policy reforms are expected to eventually result in changes\n            at the farm level, prior actions and triggers only cause\n            change at an intermediate level, which must be seen as\n            necessary steps towards achieving the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). Sector-specific DPOs have a technical\n            ministry as the main counterpart and client for policy\n            development, and the Ministry of finance and economic\n            planning as the contractual partner and client to whom the\n            resources are disbursed. The AgDPO series successfully\n            integrated a number of policy issues that are relevant to\n            the implementation of a number of Bank-financed investment\n            lending operations. An important lesson for future\n            operations is to ensure that the policy agenda underlying\n            the operation is complementary to the Bank's and other\n            development partners' investment lending operations,\n            thus creating synergies that enhance the policy making\n            process as well as program implementation. The design of\n            AgDPO policy matrices and the tracking of prior actions are\n            major undertakings that need to be better integrated in\n            Ministry of Food and

management. Here are five main policy\n            areas. (1) Agriculture technology for improved on-farm\n            productivity will focus on improved research, extension\n            services, skills training and education in agricultural\n            sciences and farm management. (2) Market and value chain\n            development will provide a market place for farmers,\n            encourage stockholding, stimulate trade, improve market\n            transparency and price discovery, and collateral to leverage\n            commercial credit. (3) Irrigated agriculture and other\n            infrastructure services will improve irrigated agriculture.\n            (4) Fisheries policy area will focus on improving the\n            management of the fisheries sector. Licensing and\n            registration of the industrial and semi industrial fleet is\n            the first and most essential step in closing access to the\n            resources and restoring profitability and sustainability to\n            the sector. (5) Agriculture sector management  will feed\n            into an agriculture expenditure budget and tracking system\n            that will not only introduce consistency in accounting, it\n            will also provide a mechanism that promotes greater\n            inter-Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA)\n            coordination on priority setting and budgeting."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Fourth Agriculture Development\n            Policy Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Fourth Agriculture\n            Development
