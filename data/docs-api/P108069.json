Some lessons learned included:\n            strategies for sustainability can be part of the project\n            design from the very beginning. Extensive use of capacity\n            substitution and supplementation as in Sierra Leon to\n            short-circuit capacity constraints while providing an\n            opportunity to move forward on the reform agenda, poses\n            clear challenges to longer-term sustainability. Monitoring\n            and evaluation arrangements are most helpful when designed\n            from the outset so as to ensure usefulness not only for\n            reporting on project performance but also for learning and\n            adjusting implementation as needed across all project\n            stakeholders. Achieving long-term sustainable institutional\n            capacity building outcomes such as the one pursued by public\n            financial management (PFM) reforms and in a post-conflict\n            context of low capacity requires a programmatic,\n            step-by-step approach built in a long-term vision but\n            focused on a reasonable number of building block priorities\n            at a time and aligned with actual capacity. Capacity\n            building requires much more than training and equipment. A\n            right balance of supply and demand side interventions in PFM\n            capacity building projects may help in achieving sustainable\n            results as there may be more appetite for PFM reforms\n            outside of the executive; an opportunity to build a\n            coalition for reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone -

Both the Bank and Borrower\u0092s\n            performances were moderately satisfactory. There were four\n            restructurings that took place during this project and\n            concerned reallocations of funding within components of the\n            project and they occurred retroactively. Reallocations were\n            introduced mainly for unintended administrative\n            expenditures. Two of the four restructurings pushed the\n            closing date of the project back for a total of eight\n            months. Some key lessons learned can be drawn from the\n            implementation of IPFMRP in Sierra Leone. The following\n            lessons could be useful for developing public sector\n            projects in post conflict countries. a) The need to clearly\n            understand the political economy and authorizing environment\n            in the country and therefore adequately sequence the\n            interventions. Conditions of this lesson include: fragile\n            domestic conditions, comprehensive planning framework,\n            institutional weaknesses, adherence to proposed\n            implementation plans, mainstreaming of LTAs, and effective\n            and efficient leadership. b) The need to focus on capacity\n            development during reform implementation in order to secure\n            adequate sustainability, which includes: knowledge of\n            financial and procurement arrangements and capacity building\n            of NSAs. c) The need to look at technical complexities\n            particularly in the ICT aspects of the reform program\n            (specifically comprehensive and targeted medium-term\n            capacity building strategy and work plan and Combining PEFA\n            based indicators with other relevant dimensions). d) The\n            need to build well-articulated coalitions both within\n            stakeholders in government, beneficiaries and donor\n            community including more frequent joint meetings, integrated\n            legislative agenda, and Medium-term expenditure framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Public
