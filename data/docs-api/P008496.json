The\n            absence of such a plan, was the cause of unrealistic\n            financial resource allocation, and project timetable.

3) training programs\n            should be monitored, to ensure the relevance of topics, and\n            the adequacy of know-how; and, 4) unscrupulous practices may\n            be prevented
