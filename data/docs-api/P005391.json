development plan (1979-1985) for off-season vegetables for\n            export. Out of about 18,000 hectares planted in off-season\n            vegetables, the proposed project will cover about 9,000\n            hectares, the production area destined for exports. It will\n            be implemented over four years and will aim at (i) doubling\n            Morocco's exports of off-season vegetables by\n            introducing modern production techniques, including\n            greenhouse technology and high-yielding hybrids, (ii)\n            strengthening subsectoral production planning and\n            monitoring, and (iii) establishing a separate marketing\n            structure for off-season vegetables. It will also seek to\n            diversify vegetable exports. At full development, the\n            project will generate incremental foreign exchange earnings\n            of $85 million annually, equivalent to about 26 percent of\n            Morocco's agricultural exports in 1977. It will benefit\n            about 8,000 farm families and employ the equivalent of an\n            additional 16,000 full-time workers at an average cost of\n            $6,000, considerably below the cost per job in small-scale industry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Vegetable Production and Marketing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Vegetable Production\n            and Marketing Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1979/08/726535/morocco-vegetable-production-marketing-project","projn":"MA-Vegetable Prod. & Mktg. -- P005391","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912455616"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agrarian Reform,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural education,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural investment,agricultural\n            land,agricultural output,agricultural prices,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,agriculture projects,animal\n            health,aquifers,arable land,Audits,Bank loans,barley,Cereal\n            yields,cereals,climatic\n            conditions,commodities,consumers,cooperatives,cotton,crop,crop\n            diversification,crop residues,Crop rotation,crop\n            yields,cropping,cropping\n            systems,crops,cultivation,development projects,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equipment,Expenditures,export\n            growth,Exports,extension,extension\n            services,farm,Farmer,Farmer\n            Associations,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizer,fertilizers,financial\n            resources,flour,food imports,food supply,forage crops,forage\n            production,forestry,fruit trees,fruits,GDP,grain,grain\n            storage,grazing,greenhouse\n            cultivation,greenhouses,Groundwater,horticultural\n            products,horticulture,hybrid\n            seeds,hybrids,imports,income,industrial\n            crops,inflation,interest rate,interest\n            rates,irri,irrigation,irrigation systems,labor force,land\n            distribution,land reform,Land Resources,Land\n            Use,lands,Livestock,livestock development,living conditions,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agrarian Reform,Agricultural\n            Development,agricultural education,Agricultural\n            Extension,agricultural investment,agricultural\n            land,agricultural output,agricultural prices,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,agriculture projects,animal\n            health,aquifers,arable land,Audits,Bank loans,barley,Cereal\n            yields,cereals,climatic\n            conditions,commodities,consumers,cooperatives,cotton,crop,crop\n            diversification,crop residues,Crop rotation,crop\n            yields,cropping,cropping\n            systems,crops,cultivation,development projects,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equipment,Expenditures,export\n            growth,Exports,extension,extension\n            services,farm,Farmer,Farmer\n            Associations,farmers,farming,farms,fertilizer,fertilizers,financial\n            resources,flour,food imports,food supply,forage crops,forage\n            production,forestry,fruit trees,fruits,GDP,grain,grain\n            storage,grazing,greenhouse\n            cultivation,greenhouses,Groundwater,horticultural\n            products,horticulture,hybrid\n            seeds,hybrids,imports,income,industrial\n            crops,inflation,interest rate,interest\n            rates,irri,irrigation,irrigation systems,labor force,land\n            distribution,land reform,Land Resources,Land\n            Use,lands,Livestock,livestock development,living conditions,"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"}},"repnb":"2523","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Maroc - Projet De Production Et De\n            Commercialisation Des Primeurs"}}},"facets":{}}}
