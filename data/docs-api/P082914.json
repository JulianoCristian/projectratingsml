Some lessons learned included:\n            sector reform can only be progressive and the Bank's\n            support through a large scale investment lending operation\n            can make a difference, if provided through an early dialogue\n            during implementation, and focused on strategic aspects,\n            high policy advice, and game changing issues. Management\n            contracts are an effective Public Private Partnerships (PPP)\n            model to foster the modernization of economically viable\n            public entities, enhance operational and financial\n            performance, and transfer know-how, especially when private\n            partners are competitively selected at an early stage, on\n            the basis of well prepared bidding documents. Large\n            infrastructure investments like airports can successfully\n            contribute to a country's economic development, through\n            regional integration, facilitation of trade, increased\n            currency earning tourism, and direct job creation from\n            attracted economic activities when a critical mass is\n            achieved. The Bank's attention and responsiveness\n            during preparation and a strong support all along the\n            project implementation is instrumental for the success of a\n            project. The demonstration of solid knowledge and timely\n            delivery of projects enhances the Bank-country relationship.\n            The quality, completeness, and relevance of the design, as\n

Further\n            mitigation measures to dispose of construction waste; and\n            minimize hazards to workforce and resident populations\n            during construction include the following: Use good site\n            practices, construct temporary noise barriers, relocate\n            equipment, reduce number of plant items and limit equipment\n            operating time, and require workers to wear protective gear\n            to reduce noise impacts.

Maintain\n            evaporation ponds in site drainage to manage surface run\n            off, lock storage tanks to prevent spilled fuel oils, empty\n            and clean oil interceptors to prevent release into the storm\n            water drainage system, dispose of waste materials at an\n            approved storage site, use portable chemical toilets and\n            sewage holding tanks, and only handle and store contaminants\n            in designated areas and ensure that a spill management plan\n            is in place.
