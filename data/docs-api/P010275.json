The project achieved its main objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was partially\n            successful, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and\n            Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, WAPDA should strengthen\n            its systems for supervision of all its ongoing projects to\n            avoid delays and get timely feedback for taking remedial\n            actions. Second, changes in original design make it\n            difficult to evaluate the project outcome compared to the\n            appraisal estimates, both in terms of costs as well as the\n            specific benefits (capacity recovery, efficiency\n            improvements, etc.) to be achieved. Finally, in the future,\n            WAPDA should ensure that progress on institution-building\n            activities takes place along with physical work. Also, any\n            deficiencies or delays on this count should be taken up with\n            senior management at an early stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Power Plant Efficiency\n            Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Power Plant Efficiency\n            Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/03/733591/pakistan-power-plant-efficiency-improvement-project","projn":"PK-Wapda VII - Pwr Plan -- P010275","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Power & Energy Conversion,Business in Development,Business Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019193904"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,Accounts,Accounts Receivable,air,air\n            pollution,billing,bills,coal,combustion,comparative\n            analysis,consumer surplus,contractors,cost control,cost\n            estimates,debt,depreciation,Energy Development,Energy\n            Efficiency,Energy generation,Energy\n            Sector,expenditures,fuels,grid,heat,Income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,Managers,natural gas,oil,Power,Power Engineering,power\n            generation,Power Plant,power plants,power sector\n            reform,power system,power utilities,private\n            sector,procurement,public\n            sector,reporting,retirement,sales,waste,willingness to pay"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,Accounts,Accounts Receivable,air,air\n            pollution,billing,bills,coal,combustion,comparative\n            analysis,consumer surplus,contractors,cost control,cost\n            estimates,debt,depreciation,Energy Development,Energy\n            Efficiency,Energy generation,Energy\n            Sector,expenditures,fuels,grid,heat,Income,inflation,inflation\n            rates,Managers,natural gas,oil,Power,Power Engineering,power\n            generation,Power Plant,power plants,power sector\n            reform,power system,power utilities,private\n            sector,procurement,public\n            sector,reporting,retirement,sales,waste,willingness to pay"}},"owner":"SAS","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"15411"},"739724":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/03/739724/pakistan-power-plant-efficiency-improvement-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1987/03/739724/pakistan-power-plant-efficiency-improvement-project","new_url":"1987/03/739724/pakistan-power-plant-efficiency-improvement-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/03/01/000009265_3970625091922/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1987/03/01/000009265_3970625091922/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2792","datestored":"1987-03-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1987-03-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Power Plant Efficiency\n            Improvement Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The primary objective of the Power Plant\n            Efficiency Improvement Project is to improve the efficiency\n            of the existing power stations and make available additional\n            generating capacity needed to minimize the anticipated\n            shortfalls in electricity at least cost to the economy.
