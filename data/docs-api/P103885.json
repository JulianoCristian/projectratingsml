Some lessons learned\n            included: the history of performance in key institutional\n            areas provides critical insight into likely project\n            performance. Improvements in physical infrastructure and\n            service delivery were not sufficient to induce a change in\n            the culture of not subscribing or not paying. Potential\n            subscribers were drawn from households long accustomed to\n            poor quality service, creating a mistrust of the service\n            provider's announced plans for a consistently high\n            quality service. In the case of West Beka'a, the\n            simplification of the project design was a double-edged\n            sword. On the one hand it allowed for successful development\n            of physical infrastructure to meet the needs of an expanding\n            population, but on the other hand, underestimated the\n            institutional disconnect with the population it serves and\n            ultimately its impact on beneficiary access. The delayed\n            appointment of a full-time Beka\u0092a Regional Water Authority\n            (BRWA) Director General impacted its ability to respond to\n            the urgent need for increasing subscription and collection\n            levels. Once the leadership position was filled, a community\n            response mechanism to address these gaps was put in place,\n            albeit late in the project lifecycle. Institutional\n            development thus requires an internal champion who is both\n            empowered and competent to build consensus around solutions\n            that can steer the institution toward success as seen by the\n            promising results on the West Beka'a subscription program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - West Beka'a Emergency Water\n            Supply

Rehabilitation and Modernization\n            Project\" is to improve the access of the population to\n            satisfactory water supply services. The project area\n            encompasses 44 villages with a present population of 203,000\n            inhabitants and is projected to reach 335,000 by the year\n            2030.   The total water demand of the project area is 28,000\n            cubic meters per day and is expected to reach 46,000 cubic\n            meters per day by the year 2030. Once operational, most of\n            the impacts of the Project will be positive.  The project\n            will lead to better services to the population and an\n            improved environment as a result of the water supply.  This\n            will lead to considerable public health benefits for the\n            residents of the area.  In particular it is expected to\n            result in a reduction in the incidences of water born\n            diseases. Adverse environmental impacts during construction\n            might not be negligible yet they are only temporary.\n            Typical impacts for pipe laying and construction of water\n            headworks are dust, noise, traffic congestion, and\n            disturbance to the residents of the area but these are\n            expected to be within acceptable limits. On the other hand,\n            incidents can arise during operation and could involve\n            accidental chlorine emissions, pipe bursts, tank leakages,\n            and occupational hazards, all of which can lead to serious\n            health risks if not addressed and dealt with in an\n            appropriate manner."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - Bekaa Water Supply Rehabilitation\n            and Modernization Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - Bekaa Water Supply\n            Rehabilitation and Modernization Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/7699199/lebanon-bekaa-water-supply-rehabilitation-modernization-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"LB-West Beka'A Emergency Water Supply\n            Project -- P103885","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Lebanon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070608133606"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Water supply","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate water, adequate water supply,\n            agricultural practices, Air pollution, air quality,\n            Alkalinity, Aluminum, aquifers, available water, available\n            water supply, Benzene, biological quality, boreholes,\n            Cadmium, Calcium, Capacity building, Catchment Areas,\n            charges for water, Chloride, chlorine, Chromium, collection\n            of water, collection system, Compliance monitoring,\n            Conductivity, construction, construction activities,\n            continuous monitoring, Copper, cubic meters, distribution\n            systems, Diversion, domestic water, Drinking Water, drinking\n            water quality, emissions, energy consumption, environmental,\n            Environmental Impact, Environmental Impact Assessment,\n            environmental impacts, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, Environmental\n            Legislation, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, Environmental\n            Monitoring, environmental policies, Environmental\n            Protection, Exploitation, ground water, groundwater,\n            Hazardous Wastes, health, health conditions, heavy metals,\n            Herbicides, households, Hydrogen, Iron, Land Use, logging,\n            Manganese, Mercury, monitoring program, Municipalities,\n            Nickel, nitrates, Nitrogen, operational costs, PCB,\n            Pesticides, PH, Phosphates, pipe laying, pipelines,\n            pollution, population growth, potable water, programs,\n            public health, Public safety, Public Works, pumping, pumping\n            stations, quality of water, quality of water resources,\n            quality water, quality       Water, raw sewage, Recharge,\n            Regulatory Framework, reservoirs, safe yield, Salinity,\n            Sand, sanitary facilities, seepage, Selenium, service\n            delivery, Spring, surface runoff, surface water, surface\n            water resources, sustainable development, Turbidity,\n            wastewater, wastewater collection, wastewater system,\n            wastewater treatment, Water demand, water distribution,\n            water facilities, water meters, Water pollution, Water\n            Protection, Water Quality, water quality monitoring, Water\n            quality studies, Water Quantity, water resources, water\n            shortage, water sources, WATER SUPPLY, water supply demand,\n            water supply facilities, WATER SUPPLY REHABILITATION, water\n            supply services, water supply system, water supply systems,\n            water system, water tankers, water tariffs, waters, wells, Zinc"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development (MNSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF058085-WEST BEKA'A EMERGENCY\n            WATER SUPPLY PROJECT (WBEWSP)","repnb":"E1660"},"facets":{}}}
