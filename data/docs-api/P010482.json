Overall Bank and\n            Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from this project include the following: 1) Social\n            mobilization needs to start early because its late start\n            during the project period is less fruitful. 2) Scheme\n            selection, entailing careful screening of schemes based on\n            social, economic, and technical criteria and longer time\n            required in reaching agreements with communities on payment\n            of Farmer Organization (FO) contributions, resulted in a\n            delayed start of the construction works. 3) Weirs are high\n            cost structures and should not be routinely constructed\n            while greater emphasis should be laid on more cost effective\n            Command Area Development (CAD) works. 4) The performance of\n            pilot flood irrigation schemes has shown that the existing\n            technical criteria need redefining; the perceived economic\n            benefits should be enlarged to include possible recharge to\n            the ground water and cattle productivity in the command\n            areas as functions of flood frequency. 5) Inflexible FO\n            contracts do not accrue maximum benefits to communities; in\n            order to be fair to farmers, FO contracts should be awarded\n            at market rates. 6) Institutional benefits do not get\n            mainstreamed by entrusting implementation to PMU."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Balochistan Community Irrigation\n            and Agriculture Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Balochistan Community\n            Irrigation and Agriculture Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/12/2149337/pakistan-balochistan-community-irrigation-agriculture-project","projn":"PK-Balochistan Community Irrigation And\n            Agriculture Project -- P010482","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Research,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water Conservation,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03022704042373"},"subsc":"Flood protection,Irrigation and drainage,Sub-national government administration,Water supply","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural chemicals,Agricultural\n            Development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            technology,Agriculture,aquifer,breeding,bund,canals,capacity\n            building,capital costs,cattle,channel,channels,clean\n            water,community participation,construction,construction of\n            infrastructure,Cost sharing,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,discharge,diseases,ditches,dosing,Drainage,drinking\n            water,erosion,farmers,farming,farming systems,Flood\n            Irrigation,ground water,impact\n            assessment,infiltration,intakes,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Scheme,irrigation systems,land tenure,lands,local\n            communities,marginal cost,performance\n            indicators,pests,Potable Water,Potable Water Supply,poverty\n            alleviation,Poverty Reduction,programs,public\n            utilities,pumps,rainfall,recharge,return period,Rural\n            Development,rural poverty,safe drinking\n            water,screening,seepage,sorghum,water charges,water\n            distribution,water diversion,water harvesting,Water\n            Management,water pollution,water rights,water supplies,Water\n            Supply,water supply systems,Water User,Water User\n            Association,Water Users,watercourses,weirs,zone of influence"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural chemicals,Agricultural\n            Development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            technology,Agriculture,aquifer,breeding,bund,canals,capacity\n            building,capital costs,cattle,channel,channels,clean\n            water,community participation,construction,construction of\n            infrastructure,Cost sharing,crop\n            yields,cropping,crops,discharge,diseases,ditches,dosing,Drainage,drinking\n            water,erosion,farmers,farming,farming systems,Flood\n            Irrigation,ground water,impact\n            assessment,infiltration,intakes,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Scheme,irrigation systems,land tenure,lands,local\n            communities,marginal cost,performance\n            indicators,pests,Potable Water,Potable Water Supply,poverty\n            alleviation,Poverty Reduction,programs,public\n            utilities,pumps,rainfall,recharge,return period,Rural\n            Development,rural poverty,safe drinking\n            water,screening,seepage,sorghum,water charges,water\n            distribution,water diversion,water harvesting,Water\n            Management,water pollution,water rights,water supplies,Water\n            Supply,water supply systems,Water User,Water User\n            Association,Water Users,watercourses,weirs,zone of influence"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF023590-NETHERLANDS -TAGPE-ENVIRONMENT,TF031478-PAKISTAN - AGRI.

In this\n            challenging environment, the Pakistani government is\n            responding through the Balochistan Community Irrigation and\n            Agriculture Project. Funded primarily by the World Bank and\n            the government of the Netherlands, the project is designed\n            to benefit about 7,000 mostly poor families, who farm\n            roughly 4,800 acres of land in the rugged terrain of\n            southwestern Pakistan.
