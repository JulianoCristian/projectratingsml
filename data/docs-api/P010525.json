Following are some of\n            the lessons learned: Government ownership and continued\n            political commitment are critical for the successful\n            implementation of major policy reforms. Using existing\n            administrative agencies (as opposed to a separate Project\n            Implementation Unit), ensures smooth project implementation\n            and long-term sustainability, provided the choice of\n            agencies is accompanied by commensurate capacity-building,\n            and an effective coordination mechanism.

There are nine\n            components: 1) curriculum development, which prepares a\n            strategy implementing a sequential and cyclical curriculum\n            in all subjects for grades 1-9, improves curriculum\n            management, and trains teachers; 2) textbooks/educational\n            publications, which improve textbook content and physical\n            condition, allow re-use and a multiple textbook option,\n            increase private sector printing, and continue private\n            sector delivery; 3) school facilities rationalization, which\n            increases equitable and cost-effective allocation of\n            educational facilities and libraries; 4) quality inputs,\n            which supply educational materials and equipment matching\n            the curriculum for elementary and junior high schools; 5)\n            libraries (component), which provides books, shelves,\n            resource materials, furniture, and trained staff in library\n
