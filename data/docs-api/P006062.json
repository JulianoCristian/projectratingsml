Several lessons are\n            drawn from the project, namely, that, technical assistance\n            lending (TAL) instruments, have limitations in addressing\n            structural issues, for however effective the operation may\n            be, an optimum performance on decisive political actions, or\n            complex decisions, should not be expected. This was probably\n            the case with the insurance, and securities market reform,\n            and, experience suggests that this operation could have been\n            more successful, had it supported a policy oriented Bank\n            operation. The tendency to overestimate the capacity to\n            absorb technical assistance, is proven by the fact that even\n            under sound administrative structures, procurement becomes\n            limited, subject to unforeseen frictions, and, furthermore,\n            TALs are administratively demanding, and management\n            intensive operations. Hence, assumption of the perfect\n            project design, may be counterproductive, since a less\n            ambitious design could better outline TAL objectives, with\n            detailed work plans for the first implementation year, to be\n            followed by agreements, for the annual review process to\n            examine. While the operation benefited from the inclusion of\n            an experienced Project Unit, the Bank should avoid financing\n            its cost, for, project accountability better improves when\n            the unit is government funded."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
