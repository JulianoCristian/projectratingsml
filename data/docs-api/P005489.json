For the foreign visitor to the rural areas\n            of countries such as Morocco, one of the chief attractions\n            is the absence of the material junk and blandness that seem\n            to accompany development. What difference does a road make?\n            What happens to people? Their farms? Their lives? In 1996,\n            the World Bank operations evaluation department asked these\n            questions to people living along rural roads in several\n            distinct Moroccan regions, each with different soils,\n            rainfall patterns, and economies. The four roads under study\n            were among 10 that were from 30 to 50 kilo meter (km) long,\n            which previously had been gravel or unimproved track with\n            traffic volumes generally below 100 vehicles per day. During\n            the course of the World Bank's fourth highway project\n            (1983-90), these roads were paved, with dramatic results.\n            Consistent with the government's strategic plan and in\n            record time, the World Bank responded with the emergency\n            drought recovery project. The project brought assistance in\n            agriculture and drinking water and supported the\n            construction and rehabilitation of 1,650 kms of rural roads.\n            The Bank is financing another 1,235 kms of rural roads under\n            the secondary, tertiary, and rural roads project (1996-2001)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - The difference a road makes"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - The difference a road makes"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2005/09/23961245/morocco-difference-road-makes","count":"Morocco","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ditches, drinking water, drought, Drought\n            Recovery, gravel, Highway, Highway Project, income, income\n            disparities between regions, irrigation, poor, poor rural\n            areas, Road, rural, rural areas, Rural Development, rural\n            population, rural roads, schooling, signs, soils, streets,\n            traffic, traffic volumes, vehicles"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","topic":"Rural Transport m1327164 789,Rural Roads m1327606 786,Transport Economics m1326662 162,Road Transport m1327629 1801,Roads and Highways m1327398 168","projn":"MA-Secondary Roads -- P005489","subtopic":"Roads & Highways,Rural Transport,Regional Economic Development,Rural Roads & Transport,Rural Poverty Reduction","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Rural Development,Transport,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150205142254"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways","theme":"Rural services and infrastructure","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Transport,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Rural Transport m1327164 789,Rural Roads m1327606 786,Transport Economics m1326662 162,Road Transport m1327629 1801,Roads and Highways m1327398 168","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF033339-MENA REGION - TRANSPORT\n            (MOROCCO, TUNISIA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"92425"},"24007592":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/24007592/morocco-more-just-road","available_in":"English","virt_coll":"Results Profile","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/05/24007592/morocco-more-just-road","new_url":"2004/05/24007592/morocco-more-just-road","disclosure_date":"2015-02-17T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2015-02-17T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2015-02-17T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/17/000442464_20150217130944/Rendered/INDEX/925540BRI0Box30ore0than0Just0a0Road.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2015/02/17/000442464_20150217130944/Rendered/PDF/925540BRI0Box30ore0than0Just0a0Road.pdf","loan_no":"3901","docdt":"2004-05-03T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2015-02-17T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Morocco - More than just a road"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"A national roads program was launched in\n            Morocco in 1995.

Sustainability is\n            rated likely. World Bank performance was rated satisfactory\n            and Borrower performance is rated satisfactory, although\n            marginally. Some of the lessons learned were the following:\n            The decision to carry out implementation through the line\n            agencies, instead of a project implementation unit proved to\n            be correct. There is a need to centralize the monitoring\n            function. Objectives should not be overly ambitious; much\n            discussion is needed with new authorities to gain ownership\n            or modify the project if necessary. A key question road\n            agencies have to respond to is: what responsibilities and at\n            what pace should the center delegate, for the process to be\n            useful and effective? Morocco's approach aiming for\n            gradual deconstruction appears to be right: the Directorate\n            of Road and Road Traffic (DRCR) approach to gradually\n            develop Regional Directorates after a pilot trial, prudently\n            expanding their advice, planning, and review functions, and\n            supported by training, appears as an appropriate way to\n            delegate central functions while avoiding atomization of\n            resources. Other lessons were related to the role of\n            competition and stable funding of road works; road\n            maintenance budgets, accounting, and targets; local\n            community participation; defining accessibility objectives;\n            policy reforms, adapting institutions, and the Bank's\n            role; and the political economy of policy reforms and\n            government organization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
