Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (a) the infrastructure sector is a crucial link\n            determining the country's ability to respond to high\n            risk natural shocks. Ensuring appropriate standards and\n            sustainable management of infrastructure are important\n            priorities for the Government, and warrants continued\n            engagement of International Development Association (IDA) in\n            the sector with these objectives; (b) the contribution to\n            institutional strengthening under the project was\n            significant, as it strengthened dialogue, provided a basis\n            for improving business processes and restructuring, and\n            developed a foundation for infrastructure asset management\n            that will support the sustainability of the project works;\n            (c) the most appropriate framework for effective\n            participation of the private sector in the provision of\n            infrastructure services needs to be found for Samoa, which\n            is limited by a thin market. The selective use of\n            joint-venture arrangements, the use of small to-moderate\n            package sizes, improved procurement procedures, and careful\n            detailing of financial requirements need to be tailored so\n            as to develop the enabling environment further for national\n            and regional firms; and (d) the protection of infrastructure\n            in coastal areas involves a range of \"hard\" and\n            \"soft\" solutions which need to be designed to\n            harmonize with coastal processes and with social and\n            cultural preferences. There is a need to assess and manage\n            coastal hazards more strategically, and to involve the\n            communities and landowners in reaching comprehensive and\n            cost-effective solutions which are also socially and\n            environmentally sustainable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Samoa - Emergency Road Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Samoa - Emergency Road\n            Rehabilitation Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/732065/samoa-emergency-road-rehabilitation-credit-project","projn":"WS-Emergency Road Rehab -- P004863","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Business Environment,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Samoa","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980728143846"},"subsc":"Roads and highways","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accident\n            rates,account,accounting,accounts,ADB,Asset\n            Management,auditing,auditors,audits,BANK\n            PERFORMANCE,beams,bridge,bridges,budgeting,business\n            processes,construction,contracting out,contractors,design\n            speed,earthworks,economic\n            recovery,employment,erosion,fatalities,financial\n            management,Fiscal Year,footpaths,framework,good\n            practices,Institutional development,land acquisition,main\n            roads,marking,motor\n            vehicles,navigation,pavement,pedestrians,periodic\n            maintenance,primary roads,private sector,private sector\n            participation,privatization,procurement,provision of\n            infrastructure,provisions,public relations,public\n            revenues,Public Sector,Public sector management,Public\n            Sector reform,Public Works,reporting,resource\n            allocation,resource allocations,road construction,road\n            hazards,road length,road maintenance,Road\n            Rehabilitation,road safety,roads,routes,routine road\n            maintenance,safety,sand,sealing,surface treatment,technical\n            assistance,traffic,traffic safety,Transport,transportation,Treasury,wind"},"1":{"cdata!":"accident\n            rates,account,accounting,accounts,ADB,Asset\n            Management,auditing,auditors,audits,BANK\n            PERFORMANCE,beams,bridge,bridges,budgeting,business\n            processes,construction,contracting out,contractors,design\n            speed,earthworks,economic\n            recovery,employment,erosion,fatalities,financial\n            management,Fiscal Year,footpaths,framework,good\n            practices,Institutional development,land acquisition,main\n            roads,marking,motor\n            vehicles,navigation,pavement,pedestrians,periodic\n            maintenance,primary roads,private sector,private sector\n            participation,privatization,procurement,provision of\n            infrastructure,provisions,public relations,public\n            revenues,Public Sector,Public sector management,Public\n            Sector reform,Public Works,reporting,resource\n            allocation,resource allocations,road construction,road\n            hazards,road length,road maintenance,Road\n            Rehabilitation,road safety,roads,routes,routine road\n            maintenance,safety,sand,sealing,surface treatment,technical\n            assistance,traffic,traffic safety,Transport,transportation,Treasury,wind"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"trustfund":"TF023801-SJF-JAPAN-STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT,TF023170-STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT,TF020071-AUSTRALIAN SOUTH PACIFIC\n            FACILITY (USD),TF023819-SJF-UK-STRUCTURAL ADJ.
