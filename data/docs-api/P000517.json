Project design and management lessons\n            suggest it would have been preferable to include an\n            institutional assessment, which would have helped in\n            determining the dimensions of the project. Similarly,\n            implementation of all components should be the\n            responsibility of national agencies, to be supported only by\n            need-base external technical assistance, rather than\n            directly entrusting to external technical aid. It is\n            recommended that a partnership between the State and the\n            communities be implemented, to ensure that community\n            teachers evolve professionally, but such partnership be\n            based on the principle that the State would provide a\n            supplemental compensation, to maintain strong\n            accountability. Sector technical lessons point at the\n            absence of structures within line ministries, responsible\n            for the analysis/assessment of textbooks' content, a\n            factor that led to an erroneous procurement of textbooks,\n            whose content did not correspond to student levels, nor\n            reflect the country's realities. Regarding the quality\n            of teacher training, there is a strong need for better\n            structured training programs, based on improved coordination\n            between pre-service, and in-service training. Finally, it is\n            reinforced that children beginning their education in their\n            native language, have a higher success rate, however, the\n            success of this experiment failed to impact a policy definition."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Basic Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad - Basic Education

The central project objective is to improve the\n            access, quality and efficiency of primary education,\n            primarily in rural areas and nationwide for girls.  To this\n            end, the project will support a national development program\n            for primary education designed to achieve the following\n            targets for 1998:  raising overall primary enrollment ratio\n            from 59% in 1990 to 65% and the share of female enrollment\n            from 31% to 36%, and reducing the average repetition rate\n            from 30% to 20%.  Secondary objectives are to promote a more\n            efficient resource use in the education sector.  To achieve\n            these objectives and to help finance recurrent costs\n            entailed by project investments, the project will support\n            policy measures to:  (a) increase public expenditures on\n            primary education; (b) increase efficiency in the use of\n            primary school teachers and classrooms; (c) promote\n            girls' participation in primary education; and (d)\n            encourage private initiatives in the provision of education.\n            Within the framework of the policy measures, the project\n            will finance investments designed to:  (i) improve the\n            access and quality of primary education nationwide; (ii)\n            support a pilot school improvement program for primary\n
