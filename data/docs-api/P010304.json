The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was partially\n            successful, sustainability is uncertain at this time, and\n            both the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, sustaining\n            Pakistan's irrigation systems requires developing\n            beneficiary-oriented, autonomous, commercially-oriented\n            public utilities in tandem with more positive participatory\n            management by beneficiaries. Second, delay in project\n            start-up (15 months from board to effectiveness) was due to\n            delay in ECNEC and USAID approval. Both the Government and\n            co-financier should have expedited the procedure to avoid\n            delays. Third, it is impossible to estimate the benefits of\n            irrigation and drainage development without carrying out\n            agro-economic monitoring and evaluation. Finally, there\n            still remains much to be improved in the technical ability\n            of small contractors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Irrigation Systems\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Irrigation\n            Systems Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/09/733377/pakistan-second-irrigation-systems-rehabilitation-project","projn":"PK-Irrigation Rehab II -- P010304","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Water Use,Water Law,Water Supply and Systems,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961219134233"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Area Water Boards,canals,collection of\n            water,Competitive Bidding,cost recovery,cost recovery\n            objectives,covering,delivery of water,distribution of\n            water,distribution\n            system,Drainage,drains,Engineering,evaporation,faults,flooding,floods,Groundwater,groundwater\n            irrigation,groundwater recharge,Irrigated\n            Agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation canals,irrigation\n            fees,Irrigation Management,Irrigation Systems,irrigation\n            water,irrigation water supply,Ministry of Water,Natural\n            Resources,percolation,Performance indicators,ponds,public\n            utilities,rain,seepage,silt,surface water,Water Board,Water\n            Boards,water charge,water charges,water deliveries,water\n            delivery,water fees,water management,water markets,water\n            rights,water supplies,water supply,water users"},"1":{"cdata!":"Area Water Boards,canals,collection of\n            water,Competitive Bidding,cost recovery,cost recovery\n            objectives,covering,delivery of water,distribution of\n            water,distribution\n            system,Drainage,drains,Engineering,evaporation,faults,flooding,floods,Groundwater,groundwater\n            irrigation,groundwater recharge,Irrigated\n            Agriculture,Irrigation,irrigation canals,irrigation\n            fees,Irrigation Management,Irrigation Systems,irrigation\n            water,irrigation water supply,Ministry of Water,Natural\n            Resources,percolation,Performance indicators,ponds,public\n            utilities,rain,seepage,silt,surface water,Water Board,Water\n            Boards,water charge,water charges,water deliveries,water\n            delivery,water fees,water management,water markets,water\n            rights,water supplies,water supply,water users"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF024520-NETHERLANDS GRANT - SECOND IRR.
