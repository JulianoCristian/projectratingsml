Some lessons learned included: in\n            conflict-affected and fragile states, projects that are\n            focused on results, which use simple design to create the\n            foundations for future growth, and leverage competent and\n            committed leadership might work better. In low-capacity\n            environments, continuity of staff with a dedicated project\n            implementation unit and sufficient Bank resources for\n            supervision are important ingredients for successful\n            processing and implementation. Projects can be successfully\n            implemented when there is a strong stakeholder commitment to\n            reform, and when there is strong political and\n            administrative commitment to monitor progress and make\n            flexible changes as required. Even in a conflict-affected\n            and poor state such as Afghanistan, the liberalization of\n            the telecommunications industry led to massive private\n            investment, rapid

      Communications Development Project is to support activities\n            designed to improve delivery of communications services to\n            the government, and to the people of Afghanistan. This will\n            be achieved by: 1) carrying out urgent expansion of the\n            government communications network, to restore critical\n            communications between ministries, and provinces; 2)\n            providing urgently needed policy advice, and capacity\n            building to the Ministry of Communications (MOC) to promote\n            sustainable communications sector performance, and increased\n            private sector participation; and, 3) improving the postal\n            sector, and the delivery of postal services. The outcomes of\n            the Project are expected to be improvements in\n            communications facilities, and delivery, while laying the\n            foundations for sector reforms, and institution building,\n            which would lead to sustainable development of the\n            communications sector. While benefits include improved\n            government communications capacity, sector development, and\n            reform, leading to greater communications access, and\n            increased private investment, there are however risks, such\n            as the technical and financial sustainability of government\n            network (mitigated through design), but as well, general\n
