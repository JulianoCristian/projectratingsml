The lessons learned indicate that the recent\n            Bank support to adjustment in Ghana has been provided under\n            a series of Economic Reform Support Operations: Economic\n            Reform Support Operation - ERSO I, II, and III. Progress in\n            the implementation of the ERSOs has been uneven and\n            experience points to the following main lessons: (i)\n            Pressing financial needs was a primary reason to proceed\n            fast with ERSO II and III. Both Credits were prepared in\n            about 3 months. When there is a need to act fast, there is a\n            basis to be cautious about the depth of the\n            Government's commitment; (ii) Despite satisfactory\n            identification of risks, mitigation measures related to the\n            political environment and capacity may not be able to\n            overcome the problem of an ambitious Credit design. The\n            above shortcomings can be tackled in an environment such as\n            the one provided by programmatic lending under the PRSCs in\n            which resource transfer decisions are linked to achievements\n            in the implementation of the country's medium-term\n            poverty reduction strategies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Second Economic Reform Support\n

Fiscal\n            policies supported under the credit improve fiscal\n            sustainability while raising the efficiency of resource\n            mobilization and use. In particular, the termination of\n            specific road contracts removes an important source of\n            fiscal imbalance and resource misallocation. Also,\n            eliminating the \"special tax\" on imports begins a\n            process to further rationalize the import tariff regime so\n            as to provide adequate incentives to local industry within a\n            regional context. Very importantly, the Credit will\n            implement a revised strategy for the cocoa sector developed\n            with strong stakeholder ownership. As part of this strategy,\n            the increase in the farmers' share of the fob price\n            will be further accelerated while external marketing will be\n            gradually opened to private competition. The Credit\n            implements key elements of the remaining reform agenda by\n            establishing market regulations, divesting the distribution\n            units of Ghana's electric company, enhancing financial\n            system soundness by targeting the closure of distressed\n            banks, and continuing the divestiture of the remaining\n            government banks. The Credit helps cover Ghana's\n            external financing requirements while it assists in reducing\n            the government's domestic financing requirements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -
