The Bank's performance was rated\n            moderately satisfactory, while the borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The significant lessons\n            learned during the implementation of the project are: 1)\n            client capacity-building for monitoring and evaluation\n            should have priority over use of external contractors; 2)\n            management model and staffing arrangements of the Integrated\n            Social Services Centers (ISSCs) need to be geared towards\n            efficiencies and effectiveness; 3) an investment loan can be\n            a powerful vehicle for sector policy dialogue; 4) Mid-Term\n            Reviews (MTR) should not be delayed; and 5) the
