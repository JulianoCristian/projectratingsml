The\n            structural, financial and macroeconomic aspects; policy and\n            institutional aspects; and the risk assessment dimensions\n            are rated satisfactory. This PRSC which became effective in\n            April 2005 is a response to the Government's request\n            for the external partners to align with national strategies\n            and systems for poverty reduction, as agreed at the\n            donor's roundtable meeting in Praia, Cape Verde's\n            capital, in April 2003.  The objective of the credit is to\n            support the implementation of the Growth and Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP).  It is a one-tranche\n            operation, the first of a planned series of three annual\n            programmatic single-tranche operations.  The financial\n            support provided through the PRSC will narrow the gap\n            between the cost of implementing key elements of the GPRSP\n            and resources available from the government's own\n            domestic revenues and other donor support.  A policy\n            dialogue and results-based framework under PRSC-1 is to\n            focus on the following pillars of the GPRSP: (a) promoting\n            good governance; (b) developing human
