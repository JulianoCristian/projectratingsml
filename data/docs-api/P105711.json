The original project development objective (PDO)\n            implied that all inventoried obsolete pesticides and\n            associated waste will be disposed of through disposal\n            overseas. However, with the discovery of greater than\n            budgeted associated waste, especially contaminated soils as\n            described above, and the consequent increase in the total\n            cost for disposal, it is preferable to adopt a blended\n            approach of disposal overseas and lower-cost safeguarding\n            in-country based on risk profiling of the contaminated\n            waste, i.e. obsolete pesticides and higher risk stocks of\n            heavily contaminated soils will be disposed of overseas\n            while lower risk stocks of associated waste will be\n            safeguarded (and later decontaminated subject to additional\n            funding) in, country. This approach is expected to eliminate\n            the stocks' risk to nearby population and the\n            environment. In addition, the original PDO assumed zero new\n            accumulations of obsolete pesticides during the life of the\n            project, which has been proven difficult to achieve in the\n            context of agricultural intensification resulting in\n            continuous new accumulations. Therefore, it is proposed that\n            the project focus rather on developing a strategy for\n            management and reduction of future accumulations to be\n            endorsed by the Steering Committee."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Africa Stockpiles Programme\n            Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Africa Stockpiles\n            Programme Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14449971/ethiopia-africa-stockpiles-programme-project-restructuring","projn":"3A-Africa Stockpiles Programme - P1 Ethiopia\n            -- P105711","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Urban Solid Waste Management,Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110624002344"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Solid waste management,Petrochemicals and fertilizers,Other industry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Water Supply and Sanitation,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, Action Plan, Bank policies,\n            Borrower, business purposes, Capacity Building,\n            certificates, chemical waste, data entry, description,\n            Disbursement, disposal operations, disposal options,\n            Disposal Services, disposal system, domain, enforcement\n            mechanisms, engineers, Environmental Management, equipment,\n            Expenditure, expenditures, final disposal, financial\n            management, financial management capacity, Financing Plan,\n            Government Organization, Grant allocation, Habitats,\n            hazardous waste, hazardous waste disposal, hazardous waste\n            disposal facilities, ID, Impact Assessment, Implementing\n            Agency, incineration, Indigenous Peoples, instrument,\n            international laws, international standards, Inventory, IP,\n            joint venture, legal agreement, legal framework, Management\n            System, Material, National Waste Management, Performance\n            Indicators, Private partnerships, private sector,\n            Procurement, procurement process, Project Management,\n            protocols, Radio, regulatory framework, Resettlement,\n            result, RESULTS, risk profile, Rural Development, Safety,\n            safety measures, sites, soils, stocks, storage facilities,\n            storage facility, supervision, technical assistance,\n            technical staff, Technical Support, Toxicity, transaction,\n            transaction costs, TRUST FUND, users, warehouse, warehouses,\n            waste, waste disposal, Waste Management, wastes"}},"owner":"Env., NRM, WRM & DRM Prac 1 (AFTN1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF090543-GEF FSP - ETHIOPIA: AFRICA\n            STOCKPILES PROGRAM - PROJECT 1","repnb":"62794"},"facets":{}}}
