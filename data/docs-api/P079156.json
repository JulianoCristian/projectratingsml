It is part of a\n            long-term village level governance program that began with\n            the first Kecamatan Project in 1998. Specific development\n            objectives for KDP-3 include: (i) institutionalizing\n            participatory processes in local government; (ii) the cost\n            effective provision o f basic social and economic\n            infrastructure; and  (iii) strengthening the capacity of the\n            micro-finance institutions developed under KDP- 1 and KDP-2\n            to manage and monitor funds sustainably. There are 6 project\n            components. Component 1 consists o f block grants that are\n            transferred directly from the Special Account to the\n            subdistricts that are participating in KDP. Block grants\n            take two forms. One block grant supports investment\n            proposals made by villages and selected by consensus in an\n            inter-village decision meeting. The second consists o f\n            block grants to support the participatory planning process.\n            Each i s described below. Component 2 consists o f\n            activities to strengthen the local government councils\n            formed under Laws 22 and 25, with a particular focus on the\n            village representative forum (BPD), inter-village forums\n            (FAD), and the district parliaments. Most o f the component\n            finances social and technical facilitators. Facilitators are\n            recruited from the private sector.

Other activities include: technical\n            assistance for BPD capacity development; training in\n            administration and monitoring skills to reinforce village\n            administration, and village-level civic information and\n            education programs about decentralization. Component 3 gives\n            support to micro-finance institutions. Project support will\n            be limited to training, technical assistance, Additional\n            activities funded through this component include training\n            courses in legislative drafting, and support to PMD for\n            carrying out overall project evaluations through the\n            provision o f technical assistance.
