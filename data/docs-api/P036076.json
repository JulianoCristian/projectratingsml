Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (a) an active and large scale employment creation\n            strategy is necessary in a situation marked by very high\n            unemployment to enable the political and social feasibility\n            of a swift implementation of reforms; (b) sequencing of\n            reforms matters. Trade and exchange rate liberalization\n            should go hand-in-hand with privatization and support to the\n            private sector for a quick supply response. The lack of such\n            a balanced and mutually supportive approach contributes to\n            de-industrialization, weakens the support for reform, and\n            undermines the implementation of the very trade and exchange\n            liberalization as they become unsustainable; and (c)\n            unbalanced and prolonged emphasis on stabilization at the\n            expense of structural reforms, and exaggerated valuation of\n            improved short term macro performance indicators alone\n            diverts attention from the need to accelerate structural\n            reform, as it gives policymakers a false sense of having\n            finished the agenda and gives the general population a false\n            expectation of an end to its

This strategy aims to support the\n            Algerian authorities in: 1) stimulating private-sector-led\n            growth; 2) protecting the poor during the transition to a\n            market-based economy; and 3) enhancing the country's\n            ability to mobilize external resources. The SAL builds on\n            progress made under the recent Economic Rehabilitation\n            Support Loan, under which the Algerian authorities made\n            tangible progress in adjustment and met many of the agreed\n            objectives, including the adoption of a privatization law,\n            sooner than anticipated. The loan supports an adjustment\n            program that is moving Algeria closer to its goal of an\n            open, market-based economy in the context of growth and\n            increased employment. The key components of the project\n            include: 1) macroeconomic stabilization and rationalization\n            of public expenditures; 2) support for public enterprise\n            reform and private sector development, including: (a)\n            large-scale privatization of small public enterprises, where\n            local demand exists; (b) further reforms designed to limit\n            the losses of large public enterprises and ready for\n            privatization; (c) increased private-sector participation in\n            subcontracting and in the provision of municipal services;\n            and (d) financial sector reform designed to increase\n            competition and create needed new financial instruments; and\n            3) support the already successful implemented new social\n            protection system, including some measures to improve its performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Structural Adjustment Loan
