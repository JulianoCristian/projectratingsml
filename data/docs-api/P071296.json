Urban Sector Development Reform Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Urban Sector Development\n            Reform Project for Indonesia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: project implementation was\n            successful owing to the high commitment of the executing\n            agency (EA), especially the central project management unit\n            (CPMU), urban local government (ULGs), and the key role of\n            the Inter-Ministerial Steering Committee (IMSC). The\n            creation of a platform for local governance reforms works\n            best through a combination of: (a) legally binding\n            regulations, (b) adequate institutional arrangements, (c)\n            actual practices, and (d) strengthening the capacity of\n            \"champions\", supported by a system of incentives\n            and disincentives. Lessons learned and experiences of local\n            governments should have been considered as inputs to the\n            relevant national legislations, so that the reform agenda is\n            tailored to local situation and realistic. Peer-to-peer\n            learning and on-the-job training are two capacity building\n            schemes that can be more effective than traditional, formal\n            training. Training with outputs that are to be implemented\n            by the ULGs under the project was quite effective to achieve\n            the key performance indicators (KPIs). Implementation of\n            subprojects will be more successful if aspects of eventual\n            long term operation (especially management set-up and\n            funding) are considered from the preparation. Capacity\n            building activities should be given more attention; this\n            includes the participation of agency leaders (Kepala Dinas)\n            and local parliament members. Funding of local subprojects\n            through subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs) tends to be\n            convoluted and protracted; future projects should consider\n            an alternative funding mechanism that is among others a\n            financial intermediary facility when numerous local\n            governments are involved. When determining the readiness for\n            implementation during the appraisal process, one key aspect\n            to expedite the start-up of project implementation is to\n            promote the advance procurement prior to loan effectiveness.\n            The trade-off of benefits between a project being open to\n            all ULGs and regional clustering should be considered very\n            carefully at appraisal, bearing in mind the inefficiencies\n            that can result from regional scattering of project\n            locations. Project design should also: (a) design a\n            mechanism, and (b) assign resources for dealing with\n            unforeseen developments, for example, (1) changes in\n            commitment of ULGs, or (2) requests from further ULGs to\n            join the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
