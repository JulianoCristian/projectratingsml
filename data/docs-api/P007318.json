Similarly, ratings on\n            Bank performance reflect unsatisfactory results, largely due\n            to inadequacies in the initial project design in addressing\n            institutional constraints, and the weak supervision of\n            project activities, while the Borrower's performance\n            reflects highly unsatisfactory ratings, based on numerous\n            difficulties encountered during implementation. Lessons\n            first address the need to balance implementation, sector\n            objectives, and social impacts, particularly under\n            post-conflict situations where important trade-offs among\n            these three aspects in project design, and intervention\n            readiness, means understanding the related costs and\n            benefits, and mitigation risks. Second, in the absence of\n            governance and institutional framework, it is necessary to\n            rely on well-defined implementation shortcuts that bypass\n            traditional government channels, but tailored to\n            implementation capacity. This leads to the need to\n            reformulate managerial, and administrative practices for\n            asset management, to maximize existing capabilities, ensure\n            greater transparency, while allowing tighter monitoring, and\n            supervisory criteria. In addition, the need to improve aid\n            coordination, specifically in project design for roads,\n            should incorporate an integrated approach, that focuses on\n            economic, and social priorities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Haiti - Road Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation
