The\n            lessons learned indicate if core issues, such as teacher\n            deployment, teacher absenteeism or poor teacher management,\n            are not adequately dealt with, then development inputs, such\n            as improved planning and education system monitoring, are\n            less effective. Importance of ensuring sufficient financial\n            support for non-salary recurrent costs was lacking under the\n            project and limited the impact of some quality-enhancement\n            measures. It was important that BPEP2 instill mechanisms and\n            processes to ensure accountability of public officials to\n            beneficiaries. Adopting a holistic view of education system\n            development over a drive will meet targets. Much of the\n            teacher training under BPEP2 was deemed to be too abstract.\n            Keeping overall responsibility for BPEP2 donor coordination\n            in the hands of His Majesty's Government of Nepal\n            (HMG/N) reduced potential levels of tension, complexity and\n            duplication of efforts.

There are three project\n            components. 1) Strengthening institutional capacity, at the\n            national level, will provide staff development and training\n            to strengthen the technical support functions of the\n            Ministry of Education and its newly established agencies and\n            develop information systems to manage a decentralized school\n            system. At the district level, the component will provide\n            training to district education staff for basic district\n            planning; and at the community level, the component will\n            provide training to headteachers in school improvement\n            planning. 2) Raising learning achievement will improve\n            teaching and learning process by reviewing the curriculum\n            content of grades 1 to 3, carry out action research with\n            teachers in small, multigrade schools, and increase textbook\n            availability through the introduction of a voucher system.\n            It will also expand teacher professional support systems and\n            improve teacher quality through demand driven training. 3)\n            Increasing equitable access and improving retention will\n            develop funding mechanism to utilize nongovernmental\n            organizations and community-based organizations to deliver\n            early
