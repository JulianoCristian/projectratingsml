It will finance the import of\n            equipment, materials, spare parts and other inputs needed in\n            coal and copper mining and the transport sector. Mongolia\n            has one of the lowest population densities in the world. In\n            addition, the geography and infrastructure of the country\n            make access to foreign markets difficult and costly.\n            Mongolia followed the Soviet model of a centrally planned\n            command economy. In 1990 an elected coalition began a\n            program of economic transformation to a market based\n            economy. The economy has suffered from external shocks,\n            although a pickup in activity in the emerging private\n            sector, industry and agriculture production has been\n            constrained by shortages of intermediate goods and spare\n            parts. The government has been implementing privatization,\n            price liberalization, changes in laws and regulations to\n            stabilize and transform the economy since 1990.

        assistance to Mongolia in order to maintain and develop key\n            sectors of its economy. It will finance the import of\n            equipment, materials, spare parts and other inputs needed in\n            coal and copper mining and the transport sector. Mongolia\n            has one of the lowest population densities in the world. In\n            addition, the geography and infrastructure of the country\n            make access to foreign markets difficult and costly.\n            Mongolia followed the Soviet model of a centrally planned\n            command economy. In 1990 an elected coalition began a\n            program of economic transformation to a market based\n            economy. The economy has suffered from external shocks,\n            although a pickup in activity in the emerging private\n            sector, industry and agriculture production has been\n            constrained by shortages of intermediate goods and spare\n            parts. The government has been implementing privatization,\n            price liberalization, changes in laws and regulations to\n            stabilize and transform the economy since 1990. This\n            project's scope and content takes into account\n            assistance planned or already underway by other bilateral\n            and multilateral agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Economic Transition Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Economic Transition\n            Support Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/10/734578/mongolia-economic-transition-support-credit-project","projn":"MN-Econ.
