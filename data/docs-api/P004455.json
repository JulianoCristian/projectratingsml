The main risk concerns the availability at the\n            right levels and at right time of the entire package of\n            agricultural supporting services. The project provides\n            measures to minimize this risk. An additional possible risk\n            will be failure to properly maintain the irrigation\n            facilities. The project also provides measures to minimize\n            this risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Second National Irrigation\n            Systems Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Second National\n            Irrigation Systems Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/02/727014/philippines-second-national-irrigation-systems-improvement-project","projn":"PH-Nisip II -- P004455","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Water Conservation,Sanitation and Sewerage,Town Water Supply and Sanitation","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912305346"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agrarian Reform,Agricultural\n            Development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            land,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,average annual\n            rainfall,canals,clay,climatic zone,Climatological\n            Data,Construction,consumptive use,corn,creeks,Crop,Crop\n            Production,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,crops,dam,Demand,detention,ditches,diversion,drain,Drainage,drainage\n            network,drains,Dry season,dry\n            seasons,Evaporation,Evapotranspiration,excess\n            water,Farm,FARM INCOMES,farm\n            irrigation,farmers,farms,Fertilizer,Flooding,gauging,Grain,Gravel,growing\n            season,humidity,Irrigation Systems,Land Ownership,land\n            reform,Land\n            Tenure,municipalities,nitrogen,paddy,percolation,PH,phosphate,physical\n            characteristics,population densities,produce,rainfall,return\n            period,Rice,rice crop,rice cultivation,rice fields,rice\n            plants,rivers,screening,sea,Service Area,small towns,soil\n            moisture,soil type,soil types,Soils,spring,sugar,sugar\n            cane,sugarcane,swamps,temperature,transplanting,wastes,Water\n            Demand,Water Management,Water Requirements,water\n            resources,Water shortage,water supplies,Water Supply,Water Supply,waterways,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agrarian Reform,Agricultural\n            Development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            land,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,average annual\n            rainfall,canals,clay,climatic zone,Climatological\n            Data,Construction,consumptive use,corn,creeks,Crop,Crop\n            Production,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,crops,dam,Demand,detention,ditches,diversion,drain,Drainage,drainage\n            network,drains,Dry season,dry\n            seasons,Evaporation,Evapotranspiration,excess\n            water,Farm,FARM INCOMES,farm\n            irrigation,farmers,farms,Fertilizer,Flooding,gauging,Grain,Gravel,growing\n            season,humidity,Irrigation Systems,Land Ownership,land\n            reform,Land\n            Tenure,municipalities,nitrogen,paddy,percolation,PH,phosphate,physical\n            characteristics,population densities,produce,rainfall,return\n            period,Rice,rice crop,rice cultivation,rice fields,rice\n            plants,rivers,screening,sea,Service Area,small towns,soil\n            moisture,soil type,soil types,Soils,spring,sugar,sugar\n            cane,sugarcane,swamps,temperature,transplanting,wastes,Water\n            Demand,Water Management,Water Requirements,water\n            resources,Water shortage,water supplies,Water Supply,Water Supply,waterways,Yields"}},"owner":"Philippines Headquarters Unit (EACPQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"1785"},"facets":{}}}
