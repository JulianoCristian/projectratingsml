The overall objectives of PREBA were to provide\n            the policy and institutional framework together with the\n            necessary educational inputs for establishing an integrated\n            six-year basic education system (EBI), as well improving\n            education sector management. The outcome of the project was\n            highly satisfactory. It exceeded its major objectives. The\n            chances of sustainability are relatively high. Lessons for\n            the future include: (i) Careful attention must be given to\n            designing and setting up the project management and\n            coordination capacity in a country to ensure successful\n            implementation and a realistic timetable set for attaining\n            institutional reform objectives. (ii) Complex project\n            management arrangements do not work well in the absence of a\n            high degree of internal coordination within a ministry that\n            is undergoing institutional restructuring itself (iii)\n            Simultaneous externally financed projects to strengthen\n            institutional capacity run the risk of overtaxing the\n            agency's managerial resources, without there being\n            greater institutional and coordination capacity already in\n            place. (iv) Financial accounting systems must be established\n            and be operational at credit effectiveness. (v) Supervision\n            must be adequate, timely, and well-focused."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Primary Education Upgrading Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cape Verde - Primary
