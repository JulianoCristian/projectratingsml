It aims to do this through\n            improving the standards of road and equipment maintenance\n            operations and management. The project includes the\n            following principal components: asphaltic concrete overlay\n            of about 76 miles of primary and main secondary roads;\n            asphaltic resealing of about 253 miles of arterial,\n            secondary and tertiary roads; equipment replacement and\n            overhaul; and about 150 man-months of technical assistance\n            to aid the MOW in the implementation of its maintenance\n            program and the Ministry of Public Utilities and\n            Transportation (MPUT) in a study of the viability of the\n            railway system.

Small farmers who use\n            these roads will benefit from the reduced cost of\n            transporting agricultural produce to market and bringing in\n            supplies.
