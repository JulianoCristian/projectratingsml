A key lesson from other transition experiences\n            and from the first four years of transition in Serbia was\n            the need for sequencing: (i) the initial steps should be the\n            immediate goals of price liberalization and fiscal\n            stability; (ii) followed by structural reforms in industrial\n            enterprises and banks and, (iii) only then, in the third\n            stage, pursue reforms in utilities, non banking institutions\n            and capital markets. Moreover, due to the political economy\n            of post conflict Serbia, it was important to start\n            enterprise privatization with sellable companies or early\n            wins and only later move onto restructuring of the\n            politically sensitive large loss makers. The focus of the\n            three stage sequencing needed to include lessons on the\n            timing and design of social policies aimed at directly\n            addressing poverty reduction and mitigating some of the\n            adverse social impacts potentially caused by the three\n            transition stages. Continued pursuit of these aims will need\n            to be closely aligned and sequenced with Government of\n            Serbia (GoS) efforts to provide adequate social protection\n            for those displaced by the envisaged restructurings and or\n            privatizations. Another factor was the coupling of social\n            protection with major restructuring efforts. The priority\n            given to mitigating the social costs of enterprise\n            restructuring, and the publicity and benefits surrounding\n            these efforts, are considered to be one of the reasons why\n            social turmoil did not erupt. Concrete efforts to provide\n            unemployment and severance payments and pre-layoff services\n            appear to have had a positive impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia - First Programmatic

Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The First Programmatic Private and\n            Financial Development Policy Credit (PPFDPC-1) for Serbia\n            and Montenegro is the first in a series of up to four\n            programmatic Development Policy Credit/Loans designed to\n            support a multi-year program of assistance to the Republic\n            of Serbia to address key institution building and reform\n            challenges in both private and public sectors. The overall\n            programmatic DPCL program aims to support sustainable\n            economic growth and employment creation in Serbia. This\n            project aims to support the Government of Serbia's\n            actions in two broad areas: (1) strengthening the fiscal\n            discipline in enterprise, energy and transport sectors, and\n            attracting foreign direct investment; and (2) building a\n            more efficient and stable financial sector and improving\n            access to finance. Project aims will be achieved through\n            government reforms as summarized in two pillars:\n            Strengthening fiscal discipline, that is, reducing the\n            Ministry of Economy's subsidy program and strengthening\n            the Transition Fund mechanisms for displaced workers;\n            privatizing, restructuring and bankruptcy of socially-owned\n            enterprises; strengthening the legal framework for mining\n            concessions; agreeing upon a time-bound process for the\n            interim restructuring of  Serbia's national electric\n            power utility; and beginning to rationalize the railway\n            sector in accord with a time-bound plan. Second, building a\n            more efficient and stable financial sector, specifically,\n            privatizing state-owned banks and divesting financial\n            assets; strengthening the insurance sector regulation and\n            resolution regime; the National Bank of Serbia's\n            addressing banking sector supervision, regulation and\n            resolutions; and improving access to finance by adopting a\n            mortgage law."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia and Montenegro - First Programmatic\n            Private and Financial Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia and Montenegro - First\n            Programmatic Private and Financial Development Policy Loan Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/01/6412162/serbia-montenegro-first-programmatic-private-financial-development-policy-loan-project","projn":"YF-Programmatic Private And Financial\n            Development Policy Credit (P -- P089116","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Economic Stabilization,Macroeconomic Management,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Serbia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20051114132328"},"subsc":"Banking,General industry and trade sector,General finance sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acceleration clause, Accountability, adverse\n            shocks, agriculture, Assets, AUDITING, banking sector,\n            banking supervision, Bankruptcy, Banks, budget constraint,\n            budget deficit, budget surplus, capacity building, capital\n            inflows, capital markets, competitiveness, creditworthiness,\n            Current Account, Current Account Deficit, current\n            expenditures, DEBT, debt restructuring, debt service,\n            Deposit Insurance, East Europe, economic activity, economic\n            growth, economic performance, economic policy, economic\n            reform, Economic Relations, Economic Sector Work,\n            Employment, entrepreneurship, Exchange Rate, exports,\n            external debt, external imbalance, Finance Ministry,\n            Financial Accountability, financial assets, financial\n            crisis, FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT, Financial Institutions,\n            financial intermediaries, Financial Management, Financial\n            Sector, financial system, fiscal adjustment, fiscal balance,\n            fiscal deficit, fiscal deficits, fiscal discipline, fiscal\n            policy, fiscal retrenchment, foreign borrowing, foreign\n            investors, GDP, GNP, Gross Domestic Product, Gross National\n            Product, hard budget constraints, inflation, inflation rate,\n            informal sector, institutional changes, institutional\n            framework, interest rates, International Monetary Fund,\n            international reserves, Labor Market, laws, legal framework,\n            legislation, Liquidity, London Club, macro stability,\n            macroeconomic framework, macroeconomic stability,\n            macroeconomic stabilization, monetary policy, poverty\n            levels, Poverty Reduction, present value, price increases,\n            private investment, Private Sector, Privatization,\n            productive assets, productivity, Public, public debt, Public\n            Expenditure, public investment, Public Procurement, Public\n            Procurement Law, public revenues, public savings, public\n            sector, Public Service, public services, public spending,\n            Real GDP, real sector, real wages, reform agenda,\n            reorganization, rising debt, risk premium, Savings, sector\n            restructuring, social transfers, Structural Adjustment,\n            structural reforms, supervisory framework, tax, tax\n            collection, tax rates, tax revenues, taxation, technical\n            assistance, tight fiscal policy, trade balance, trade\n            deficit, transition economies, transport, Treasury,\n            unemployment, utilities, wages, working capital"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Development Policy Lending"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF054607-PHRD-SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO:\n            PROGRAMMATIC ADJUSTMENT LOAN","repnb":"33990"},"facets":{}}}
