The Emergency\n            Project focused on essential repairs of physical and social\n            infrastructure in various sectors (power, water and\n            sanitation, solid waste, education, housing, etc.) while\n            paving the way for future sector reforms. The project\n            achieved most of its physical objectives, particularly in\n            the power and water and sanitation sectors, but was less\n            successful in the implementation of basic sector reforms.\n            Overall the project outcome is rated as satisfactory. The\n            Solid Waste Project\u0092s objective to provide solid waste\n            collection and treatment facilities for the whole country\n            was overly ambitious. At completion, only one of the 15\n            sanitary landfills planned was completed. The project almost\n            totally failed to achieve its objectives, and its outcome is\n            rated as unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from this\n            assessment included: government efforts remain concentrated\n            on slowly expanding infrastructure for water supply, solid\n            waste management and electricity and less on sector reform,\n            although there were notable achievements in the Ministry of\n            Finance and Telecommunications. Institutional issues\n            requiring cross-sectoral coordination have made little\n            progress. Attention to improving cost recovery, demand\n            management and environmental conservation has languished as\n            government continues to subsidize the delivery of basic\n            services on response to political pressure. What little\n            attention there was to long-range planning, conservation,\n            trade-offs, and efficiency improvements has become hostage\n            to the uncertain political climate and inability to bridge\n            sectarian differences for the common good. The most recent\n            34-day war between Hezbollah and Israeli starting July 2006\n            underscores the tremendous governance challenges in Lebanon\n            in which political authority is diffused, by design, among\n            various sects and branches of government. The continued\n            importance of sustainable natural resource and environmental\n            management is recognized by the Bank and forms the third\n            pillar of the 2006 country assistance strategy (CAS). And it\n            is likely, as before, that essential institutional\n            strengthening and reform in the primary water supply,\n            sanitation, solid waste and electricity service sectors will\n            be sidelined in the new national reconstruction program\n            following the July 2006 war. As a national consensus on\n            solid waste management seems unlikely in the short to medium\n            term, the Bank may consider supporting additional pilot\n            projects and private sector participation (PPP) in the\n            sector to overcome the information asymmetry that thwarts a\n            consensus on how to proceed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - Emergency Reconstruction and\n            Rehabilitation and Solid Waste and Environmental Managment Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - Emergency\n            Reconstruction and Rehabilitation and Solid Waste and\n            Environmental Managment Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/01/9360993/lebanon-emergency-reconstruction-rehabilitation-solid-waste-environmental-managment-projects","count":"Lebanon","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"air pollution, average costs, Coastal Zone\n            Management, Coastal zones, common good, compactor trucks,\n            compost, compost marketing, compost plant, compost plants,\n            composting, composting plants, debt, diffusion,\n            disinfection, disposal facilities, disposal method, disposal\n            option, disposal services, disposal site, disposal sites,\n            distribution systems, dump sites, dumpsite, economic growth,\n            economic impact, economic policies, EIA, electric power,\n            electricity, ENVIRONMENTAL, Environmental Assessment,\n            environmental conservation, environmental degradation,\n            environmental impact, environmental impacts, environmental\n            issues, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, environmental quality,\n            Global Environment, GNP, hazardous wastes, income, landfill,\n            landfill equipment, landfill management, landfill sites,\n            Landfilling, litter, Middle East, mining, MUNICIPAL\n            ENGINEER, municipal management, Natural Resources, NIMBY,\n            North Africa, odors, oil, open burning, opportunity costs,\n            Pollution Control, power stations, productivity, public\n            goods, public utilities, Quality Assessment, recovery\n            systems, refuse, refuse collection, rural communities,\n            sanitary landfill, sanitary landfills, sanitation, sewer\n            systems, sewerage, sewerage system, sewerage systems,\n            shantytowns, site operation, site selection, SOLID WASTE,\n            solid waste collection, solid waste component, solid waste\n            disposal, solid waste disposal sites, solid waste\n            facilities, solid waste issues, Solid Waste Management,\n            solid waste management strategy, solid waste sector, solid\n            waste transfer, solid waste transfer stations, source\n            separation, SWM, textbooks, urban waste, waste dumping,\n            waste dumps, waste management facilities, waste management\n            scheme, waste management system, waste management systems,\n            waste minimization, waste reduction, waste treatment, waste\n            treatment facilities, waste water, wastewater, wastewater\n            treatment, wastewater treatment plants, water supply, water treatment"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Environment and natural resource management","projn":"LB-Solid Waste/Environment -- P005345,LB-Emergency Recovery -- P005336","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Urban Solid Waste Management,Wastewater Treatment,Sanitation and Sewerage,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Environment","entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20080416012635"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Solid waste management,Central government administration,Power,Other industry,Housing construction","theme":"Municipal finance,Water resource management,Pollution management and environmental health,Other urban development,Other financial and private sector development","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Envir & Nat.

Through the\n            implementation of the project, a number of lessons have been\n            reinforced. The nature of emergency operations requires\n            quick responsiveness to infrastructure rehabilitation in\n            general, and to investments, and procurement related needs\n            in particular, which can be accomplished through a timely\n            inventory of crucial investments, designed in light of the\n            damage assessment reports, but focused on initial modest\n            investments, so as to help mitigate immediate environmental,\n            and health hazards effectively, and, create a process which\n            can validate rehabilitation needs, as and when presented.\n            Therefore, it is not advisable to combine subsequent large\n            development investments, with emergency works for\n            implementing numerous, though small rehabilitation works,\n            since it is difficult enough in the initial prevailing\n            environment of capital, and skilled labor constraints. The\n            subsequent large investments in water, and wastewater at\n            Met'n Barouk, and Ba'albeck required a number of\n            extensions, thus delaying project completion, which should\n            have otherwise progressed fast, as the nature of emergency\n            operations so require. The effectiveness of the Council for\n            Development and Reconstruction (CDR) is highlighted, which\n            as an autonomous entity, streamlined, and coordinated the\n            rehabilitation efforts, and is continuing such a role, given\n            that emergencies caused by incidences of external\n            hostilities such as in Lebanon, cannot be ruled out in the\n            future.
