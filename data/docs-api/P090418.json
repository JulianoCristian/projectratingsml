Some lessons learned included: the\n            project provides a set of lessons for future operations,\n            both in terms of design features and implementation\n            arrangements. In terms of design, it is important to\n            understand the tax administration aspects of a pension\n            administration reform involving collection related issues.\n            Relevant tax administration expertise needs to be brought on\n            board from the early phases of project preparation and\n            maintained throughout implementation. It is equally\n            important to involve the tax office early on, not only\n            because of their mandated role, but they also tend to be the\n            strongest institution in terms of human and technical\n            capacity, legal instruments of enforcement at their disposal\n            and political support. It is also important to ensure\n            through design features and implementation arrangements that\n            the tax administration is made interested in the success of\n            the project and the reform it supports. A stakeholder\n            analysis of the participating institutions is crucial in\n            order to identify potential reasons for support and\n            resistance, the areas where cooperation is natural and where\n            it needs more attention from high level officials in a\n            position to resolve institutional problems. In the case of\n            projects with technically complex components where various\n            approaches may exist, it is critical to agree with the\n            client on the approach, institutional and broad technical\n            solution to be pursued. Effective supervision, based on an\n            understanding of the clients\u0092 objectives and constraints is\n            crucial and can help overcome and offset problems inherent\n            in the design or country circumstances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia - Consolidated Collection and Pension\n            Administration Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia -
