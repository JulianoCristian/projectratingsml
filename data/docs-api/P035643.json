At project closing, it had once again\n            significantly improved in terms of education management,\n            which had become a major weakness in the last year. This led\n            to a marginally satisfactory rating at project closing, as\n            follows : project outcome was satisfactory; sustainability\n            is unlikely; institutional development impact is marginal;\n            Bank performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            is unsatisfactory. The project offers a number of important\n            lessons with respect to a) establishment of a government\n            task team at the early preparation stage is important; b)\n            salary scales in the project coordination unit need to be in\n            line with those of private sector competitors, this will\n            prevent attrition of competent individuals; c) enrollment\n            growth in secondary education can be accompanied by\n            important developments in private sector participation and\n            household cost sharing; d) girl's scholarships have\n            important impacts on enrollment at the post-basic level.\n            Scholarships for girls ensure that cost considerations do\n            not keep them out of school and permit to raise enrollment\n            of girls significantly; e) teacher training programs need to\n            be given sustained attention; finally, strong coordination\n            is needed among donors to ensure consistency among the\n            respective education projects in alignment with the\n            priorities of government's national education policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia - Third Education Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gambia - Third Education Sector
