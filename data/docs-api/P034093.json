Lessons drawn from the\n            project address primarily, the importance of realistic\n            reform targets, even if they are ambitious, for they provide\n            the stimulus for government reform support, commitment, and\n            wider participation in structural adjustment lending.\n            Likewise, appropriate counterpart in terms of scope, and\n            level of authority, is particularly important, since it\n            provides the highest, and continuous political support. But\n            reform program actions should be based on execution, with\n            specific control by local authorities, to provide the\n            benefit of timely budgeted allowances. Furthermore,\n            extensive, and specialized technical assistance (TA) is\n            necessary to implement institutional reforms, because not\n            only, changes in systems, and processes are required, but\n            because reforms are difficult to implement, complex, and\n            time-consuming, and, most importantly, TA provides the\n            professional skills required in a changing environment. This\n            cannot be achieved without responsive donor partners, whose\n            assistance, and effectiveness proved critical in the\n            provision of a timely, and high-quality

Bank\n            Group's assistance strategy for Kazakhstan outlined in\n            the \"Country Assistance Strategy Memorandum.\" The\n            focus is on four areas: 1) sustaining private sector-led\n            growth; 2) restructuring agriculture; 3) rehabilitating\n            basic physical infrastructure; and 4) mitigating\n            transitional poverty and promoting social service\n            sustainability. The first tranche will be released soon\n            after the loan becomes effective. The second tranche will be\n            released by: 1) discontinuing budgetary support for\n            identified agencies; 2) resolving inconsistencies between\n            the civil service census and payroll lists; 3) enacting the\n            new law on state procurement and enabling regulations; 4)\n            eliminating pension fund arrears; 5) setting up a database\n            of all investments proposed by ministries and local\n            governments; 6) revising tariff regulations in the power\n            sector and for communal services; 7) revising utility and\n            housing subsidies; 8) implementing agreed-to technical\n            assistance programs; and 9) all measures consistent with a\n            Bank recapitalization plan. The following actions will\n            trigger the release of the third tranche: 1) privatizing or\n            liquidating certain entities; 2) enacting new civil service\n            laws and/or regulations; 3) implementing procedures to award\n            publicly-financed contracts; 4) containing the arrears of\n            the central and local governments within agreed amounts; 5)\n            publishing an audit report in the official gazette; 6)\n            making the Public Investment Program (PIP) consistent with\n            the external debt program and with the estimated future\n            macroeconomic framework; and 7) conforming tariffs for\n            heating and electricity to be consistent with revised regulations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Public
