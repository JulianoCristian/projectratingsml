Total cost of the project is\n            estimated at FMG 1,778 million, the equivalent of $7.2\n            million, with a foreign exchange component equivalent to\n            $4.3 million. The three secondary technical institutes\n            account for about 82 percent, the \"Institut\n            Pedagogique\" for 14 percent, and the physical-education\n            teacher training center for only 4 percent of the total\n            cost. The proposed bank loan of $4.8 million represents\n            two-thirds of the estimated cost of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"R\u00e9publique Malgache - Complexe Scolaire de Tananarive"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malagasy Republic - Tananarive\n            Education Project : R\u00e9publique Malgache - Complexe Scolaire\n            de Tananarive"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1967/07/15599076/malagasy-republic-tananarive-education-project-r\u00e9publique-malgache-complexe-scolaire-de-tananarive","projn":"MG-Education-155215 -- P001468","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Gender and Education,Primary Education,Curriculum & Instruction,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender,Education","count":"Madagascar","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20120105233343"},"subsc":"Secondary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Technical operations projects series,no.
