Some lessons learned included: National\n            Highways Authority of India (NHAI) must have at least 50\n            percent of the land acquired and encumbrance free prior to\n            contract award. It should also consider entering into long\n            term arrangements with state governments at program rather\n            than project. Creation of a strong design review capability\n            within NHAI is critical to stalling the multiple delays\n            which are locked in early on as a result of flawed detailed\n            project reports (DPRs). This in-house capability would allow\n            for DPR proof checks, ensure quality designs from\n            consultants as also concessionaires. It could also help\n            develop design standards for national highways and ensure\n            that the national highways exhibit consistency of design.\n            Guidelines for DPRs specifying minimum time for preparation\n            and use of latest technologies in preparation should be\n            issued. Finally, there is a strong need for NHAI to align\n            its staffing requirements (strength and profile) with the\n            increase in the size of its work program and the shift to\n            public-private partnership (PPP) modality. Understaffing at\n            project implementation units (PIUs), Finance, environmental\n            and social development unit (ESDU) is affecting performance.\n            Second, it should focus on developing a cadre of permanent\n            staff, targeting at least 50 percent of staff strength."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Grand Trunk Road Improvement

Development Program (NHDP)\n            through a series of loans. The Grand Trunk Road Improvment\n            Project (GTRIP) is the second project in the series,\n            following the Third National Highway Project (TNHP), which\n            was approved and is under implementation. The development\n            objectives of GTRIP are consistent with those of the TNHP:\n            1) to reduce transport constraints on national economic\n            activity; and 2) to improve institutional capabilities to\n            manage road programs, assets, and services on a more\n            commercial basis. There are three project components. The\n            first finances highway upgrading, including civil works for\n            widening and strengthening highway lanes, supervision\n            consultant services, as well as funding land acquisition,\n            utility relocation, resettlement and rehabilitation,and\n            environmental mitigation/management. The second component\n            finances road safety and corridor management works,\n            including consultant services for a safety audit, a program\n            of road improvements specifically targeted at supporting\n            improved methods for reducing accidents and improving safety\n            on the national highway network, and a program of\n            maintenance works to introduce alternative contracting\n            methods and to strengthen maintenance management practices.\n            The third component establishes a public-private partnership\n            in road concession, and the fourth component supports social\n            and environmental as well as road capacity building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Grand Trunk Road Improvement

To prevent\n            soil erosion, sedimentation, and water pollution, the use of\n            dikes, sediment basins, and slope drains shall be used in\n            accordance with engineering designs. Lubricants and oil\n            spills shall be contained through oil interceptors for\n            refueling cases with fuel storage at appropriate sites, and\n            disposal of petroleum products in accordance with\n            environmental guidelines. Spoils, and solid wastes shall be\n            treated, and disposed of at selected disposal sites.
