Honduras, the\n            second largest country in Central America in terms of area,\n            has two coast lines: the major one on the Caribbean Sea and\n            a smaller one on the Pacific Ocean. Its terrain is\n            mountainous and the climate is tropical. Bananas, lumber,\n            coffee, cattle, and sugar are the major goods produced.\n            Ports play a key role in the country's international\n            trade, handling nearly 95 percent of total imports and\n            exports. Puerto Cortes on the Caribbean is the\n            country's principal port, accounting for more than 70\n            percent of all seaborne traffic. Until this project, the\n            small ports of Amapala and San Lorenzo on the Gulf of\n            Fonseca had served as the gateway on the Pacific side.
