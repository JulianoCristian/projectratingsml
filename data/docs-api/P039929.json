Some lessons learned included: all aspects\n            of each micro-project, including its size, require a very\n            careful consideration; also, necessary trade-offs should be\n            taken into account, such as the objective of the\n            micro-project, its technical aspect and its cost. In several\n            cases, mostly related to rural school buildings, it was\n            observed that the size exceeded the needs of the current\n            number of students. Those schools were built in early 1950s\n            and 1960s and used to serve a much bigger number of\n            students. The student population has decreased over time\n            because of out migration and declining fertility. In the\n            cases of such micro-projects, the communities and Georgia\n            Social Investment Fund (GSIF) were facing a dilemma whether\n            to refurbish only a part of the building or entire building.\n            Whenever possible, only parts of the buildings were\n            refurbished, but with careful consideration concerning the\n            quality of learning environment and technical feasibility.\n            However, in some cases, this type of work (particularly roof\n            repairs) could not be done only partially. The percentage of\n            counterpart funds for this type of micro-projects should be\n            estimated carefully, taking into account the particular\n            circumstances of the country and the ability to contribute.\n            In this project, the lack of timely counterpart funds,\n            either from the community side (due to low ownership), or\n            from the government side (caused by the overall poor\n            macroeconomic situation), generated delays in\n            implementation, dissatisfaction among the contractors and\n            community members, or tended to temporarily shift the focus\n            from the poor to better-off communities. Smaller community\n            contribution would probably be more appropriate for a\n            country such as Georgia, where poverty is widespread\n            especially in the rural areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia -

GSIF mobilizes public and private resources\n            and channels them through small investments. The\n            project's secondary objectives are to a) strengthen the\n            capacity of private, small-scale contractors and build the\n            capacity of communities; b) generate employment; and c)\n            build greater capacity for policymakers to monitor and\n            analyze poverty trends. The project has four components: 1)\n            Rehabilitating small-scale infrastructure, about 400\n            microprojects, including civil works improving water supply,\n            sanitation, solid waste management; and rehabilitating local\n            clinics, primary schools, and feeder roads; 2) Providing\n            equipment, vehicles, salaries, operating costs, training,\n            technical assistance; and financing for monitoring and\n            evaluating implementation; 3) Building the capacity of small\n            contractors to prepare bids and execute work contracts;\n            providing training and technical assistance to communities;\n            financing contracts with individuals, firms, and\n            nongovernmental organizations to provide others with\n            technical assistance; and funding regional launch workshops;\n            and 4) Financially supporting the statistics\n            department's (SDS) budget for conducting living\n            standards monitoring surveys (LSM); and offering it\n            technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Social Investment Fund
