Lessons convey primarily, that\n            in spite of difficult times - after a decade of economic\n            slowdown, fiscal deficits, and progressive inflation - such\n            times can indeed promote change: sectoral reforms could be\n            achieved, although change was slow, but the lengthy process\n            resulted in a stronger transport sector, with policies\n            focused on efficiency, achieving institutional restructuring\n            of sector authorities. And, in spite of added complexities\n            to project implementation, such as the number of\n            institutions involved, the sectoral analysis on each\n            sub-sector, provided a better understanding of institutional\n            needs. Notably, the project improved the planning capacity\n            for road maintenance, and investments, demonstrating how a\n            planning capacity requires a dependable source of funding to\n            sustain investment programs. The road, and highway\n            sub-sectors, supported by financial resources, is in a\n            privileged position to confront the national network\n            maintenance acceptably. However, this sub-sector still faces\n            the task of improving road conditions, which should be\n            challenged by providing sound policies, and optional plans\n            to meet sector objectives. Regarding the railways\n            sub-sector, assistance in rationalizing its operations was\n            provided through a continuous management support, and, with\n            the concession law of 1998, a new concession process has\n            been initiated, with prospects for cargo remaining positive.\n            Renewed interest in the decentralization of cantonal roads,\n            stirred the Bank's interest to support a new operation.\n            But, it is important to note the need to streamline the\n            procurement process, so as to gain operational efficiency,\n            and avoid frequent construction delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Costa Rica - Transport Sector Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Costa Rica - Transport Sector\n
