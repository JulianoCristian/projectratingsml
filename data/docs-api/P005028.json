24,000 feddans (net) of reclaimed desert land; (b)\n            settlement of 4,000 smallholder in 20 villages and provision\n            of necessary economic and social infrastructure; (c)\n            provision of farm machinery, consultant services and\n            training, and farm credit. In addition, the project includes\n            a bilharzia component to consolidate the national program\n            and to expand the control program into the project area and\n            Giza Governorate. Major project benefits include provision\n            of agricultural land and increased incomes for 4,000 low\n            income farm families and unquantifiable benefits of\n            increasing the control of bilharzia. The major risk is\n            whether the actual management and organization of the\n            project will be adequate. The design of the project with a\n            staged development, simple irrigation system, and three\n            tiered organizational structure (Central Coordinating\n            Committee, Project Unit, and Regional Implementation\n            Committee) should minimize this risk. Assurances were also\n            obtained that the government would ensure the timely\n            availability of adequate funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - New Land Development (West Nubariya) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - New Land Development\n            (West Nubariya) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/10/726262/egypt-new-land-development-west-nubariya-project","projn":"EG-New Land Devt -- P005028","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912502475"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,Agricultural\n            Cooperatives,Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            growth,Agricultural Investment,agricultural\n            investments,agricultural output,Agricultural\n            Production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agricultural\n            Training,Agriculture,agronomy,alfalfa,alternative\n            crops,Animal\n            Production,animals,barley,beans,breeding,capital\n            costs,cattle,cereal crops,climatic\n            conditions,cottonseed,Crop,Crop Production,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,crops,cultivation,dairy products,Dam,demand for\n            water,Drainage,economic growth,Economic Rate of\n            Return,eggplant,employment,Equipment,exports,Extension,extension\n            services,extensionists,FAO,Farm,farmer,Farmers,farming,farms,fava\n            beans,feed,fertilizer,Field\n            Trials,fish,Fisheries,flour,fodder crops,food\n            production,fruits,GNP,grain,grain\n            production,grapes,grazing,groundnuts,groundwater,growth\n            rate,Housing,identity,IFAD,imports,Income,incomes,interest\n            rates,International Fund for Agricultural\n            Development,Irrigation,labor force,labor markets,Land\n            Development,land productivity,Land Reclamation,Land\n            Resources,Lands,legislation,legumes,Livestock,livestock\n            products,livestock research,logging,"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural commodities,Agricultural\n            Cooperatives,Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            growth,Agricultural Investment,agricultural\n            investments,agricultural output,Agricultural\n            Production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agricultural\n            Training,Agriculture,agronomy,alfalfa,alternative\n            crops,Animal\n            Production,animals,barley,beans,breeding,capital\n            costs,cattle,cereal crops,climatic\n            conditions,cottonseed,Crop,Crop Production,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,crops,cultivation,dairy products,Dam,demand for\n            water,Drainage,economic growth,Economic Rate of\n            Return,eggplant,employment,Equipment,exports,Extension,extension\n            services,extensionists,FAO,Farm,farmer,Farmers,farming,farms,fava\n            beans,feed,fertilizer,Field\n            Trials,fish,Fisheries,flour,fodder crops,food\n            production,fruits,GNP,grain,grain\n            production,grapes,grazing,groundnuts,groundwater,growth\n            rate,Housing,identity,IFAD,imports,Income,incomes,interest\n            rates,International Fund for Agricultural\n            Development,Irrigation,labor force,labor markets,Land\n            Development,land productivity,Land Reclamation,Land\n            Resources,Lands,legislation,legumes,Livestock,livestock\n            products,livestock research,logging,"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"3010"},"facets":{}}}
