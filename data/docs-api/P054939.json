The lessons\n            learned indicate that the social investment fund concept can\n            work as vehicle to achieve poverty reduction in small island\n            countries. Communities can manage key aspects of the\n            subproject cycle, and this contributes to local capacity and\n            ownership. Building lasting and greater social capital is a\n            long-term process. Capacity building is critical, but should\n            be linked as much as possible to the labor market. Project\n            design should consider the long start-up time for new\n            entities. Good managers with decision-making autonomy, and\n            adequate staffing, are key to successful implementation.\n            Community participation fosters the appropriate selection of\n            subprojects. Appropriate design and timing of monitoring and\n            evaluation instruments is crucial to monitoring project\n            impacts. A communications strategy would benefit the Poverty\n            Reduction Fund (PRF). Duplication of donor efforts continues\n            to be a concern and requires careful consideration by the\n            World Bank.

The project components include: 1)\n            institutional strengthening for poverty reduction, to\n            further increase the role and responsibilities of\n            communities in the subproject cycle development, including\n            subproject management, and strengthening promotion\n            mechanisms. This component will include the establishment of\n            appropriate methodologies and criteria of the subproject\n            cycle, in accordance with all relevant parties involved in\n            poverty reduction; 2) subproject financing, which will\n            mobilize external co-financing, with possible support from\n            other agencies, such as the Caribbean Development Bank and\n            the European Union. Subproject implementation will include\n            social and economic infrastructure, technical assistance and\n            capacity-building for social assistance programs; 3) project\n            management costs, to cover the execution of the design\n            phase, and implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Saint Lucia - Poverty Reduction Fund
