PRSCs can make little\n            progress without a foundation of trust between the Bank and\n            the government, and among development partners at the\n            institutional and individual levels. The mechanisms for\n            dialogue also need to evolve so that the program can\n            continue to support and influence policy decisions at the\n            highest strategic level. To avoid misunderstanding, the Bank\n            and government can plan in advance to recalibrate the\n            program at a set point during implementation. The lack of\n            well-defined and realistic objectives and a fully developed\n            results framework makes adjustment to changing circumstances\n            difficult. Regular reporting on key outcome indicators is\n            essential so that data can drive adjustments to the PRSC\n            program. Transitioning to the use of PRSCs as the primary\n            instrument for resource transfer is only likely to be\n            successful in rare circumstances, when strong central\n            ministries can fully pursue a sector-inclusive dialogue\n            representing the perspectives of key players throughout\n            government. Elevating to the national dialogue\n            sector-specific structural reforms that stalled at the\n            sector level does not guarantee implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -

satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: Government ownership of the reform agenda is the\n            single most important factor determining the success of\n            reforms. The performance assessment framework has proven\n            useful for the monitoring of reforms, but linking\n            disbursement decisions to specific actions has been a two\n            edged sword. While in some cases this has helped to\n            accelerate the pace of reaching a specific milestone, in\n            other instances, the processes of dialogue and\n            conditionality have become closely interwoven, crowding out\n            the space for a dispassionate, objective, and non-committal\n            sharing of views. The focus on a large number of actions\n            contained in the performance assessment framework (PAF) may\n            also have reduced the strategic focus of the budget support.\n            There appears to be a tension between broad-based progress,\n            which is necessary to ensure improvements of government\n            institutions and systems, and more focused policy dialogue\n            to align PRSC with the critical bottlenecks to growth and\n            poverty reduction. More focus on public expenditure\n            efficiency and effectiveness, and implementation of policy\n            through the budget may be required. This may require a\n            significant revamping of the public expenditure review (PER)\n            process, to bring it back to supporting effective and timely\n            dialogue on key
