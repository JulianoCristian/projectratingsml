Project sustainability for all five\n            projects is unlikely or non-evaluable. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are adjudged as satisfactory for four\n            of the projects but unsatisfactory for the ASIP. The project\n            audits provide the building blocks for the sector review,\n            which finds impressive improvement. The projects offer six\n            main lessons: 1) Borrower capacity to provide counterpart\n            funding should be projected and realistically assessed, and\n            program design should be adjusted to match the findings of\n            that assessment. 2) There are opportunities for relatively\n            minor adjustments in project strategy and mechanisms which\n            can enhance poverty focus without risk to growth. 3)\n            Publicly funded agricultural research needs to focus not\n            simply on yield maximization but on financial profitability,\n            returns to labor, and the low input technology needs of the\n            poorer farmers. 4) to improve the efficiency of extension\n            services, a phased strategy is needed to increase the role\n            of cost recovery, private sector, community groups, and\n            nongovernmental organizations. 5) Regarding community\n            infrastructure investments, approaches that specifically\n            target the poor. 6) Likely impacts need to be addressed\n            through some form of short-term safety net."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

Emphasis is given to\n            institutional and human resource development and reaching\n            more women farmers. The project includes three components:\n            (a) strengthening the extension services in all the ten\n            regions through provision of infrastructure, transport,\n            equipment, consultancy services and incremental recurrent\n            cost support on a declining basis and forging a closer link\n            between extension and agricultural research services; (b)\n            strengthening the technical departments of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture to expand sectoral capacity to test the\n            relevance of technologies generated by research institutes\n            to farmers' conditions through provision of transport,\n            equipment, consultancies, and incremental recurrent cost\n            support to subject matter specialists and to project\n            monitoring and evaluation; and (c) supporting human resource\n            development through improved facilities, provision of\n            teaching materials, farm and laboratory equipment, and\n            transport support as well as policy improvements,\n            institutional reforms of agricultural colleges and the\n            provision of text books to the
