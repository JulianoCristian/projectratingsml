Based on the\n            analysis, this medical waste management plan suggest\n            recommendations as follows. Legislation on medical, and\n            biomedical waste management needs to be established,\n            implemented, and enforced, regulated by waste management\n            committees at the national, provincial, and municipal\n            levels, with communal participation. In addition, hospitals\n            and health care facilities should establish their own\n            medical waste plans in compliance with the country's\n            laws, and regulations, in order to set a governing\n            institutional framework. Medical personnel should be trained\n            in the management of the overall medical waste sector, and\n            in addition, training should be further provided to staff\n            members in charge of the institution's cleaning, and\n            waste management practices. Public awareness should be\n            raised, through community mobilization, and active\n            participation of civil society, the private sector,\n            organizations in general, and policymakers in particular, on\n            the adequate management of biomedical wastes. Most\n            importantly, electrical incinerators should replace existing\n            ones, based on standard sanitary regulations, but to be\n            later phased-out, and replaced by new waste treatment technologies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Deuxieme Projet Sante et\n            Population (SUPPLEMENTAL) : plan de gestion des dechets medicaux"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Deuxi\u00e8me projet sant\u00e9\n            et population (SUPPLEMENTAL) : plan de gestion des d\u00e9chets m\u00e9dicaux"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/12/2127602/burundi-deuxieme-projet-sante-population-supplemental-plan-de-gestion-des-dechets-medicaux","projn":"BI-Health And Population II - Supplemental\n            Grant To Credit No. 273 -- P078111,BI-Second Health And Population Project -- P000216","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Burundi","authors":{"authr":"Bikwemu, Gaspard"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03020104012482"},"subsc":"Other social services,General public administration sector,Health,Central government administration,Non-compulsory health finance","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment;
