projects for livestock and dairy development;\n            (b) to promote agricultural diversification by supporting\n            cultivation of crops in association with livestock; and (c)\n            to assist settlers in National Settlement Institute colonies\n            to improve techniques and production patterns on their\n            farms, which are currently suffering from soil erosion and\n            depletion. The objectives would be achieved through a three\n            year commitment, five year investment program of US$100\n            million equivalent, assisted by extension and technical\n            services costing about US$11.0 million. Sixty percent of the\n            investment program would be financed by the Bank of the\n            Republic; the Bank and the farmers would finance the\n            remainder. The project faces no unusual risks. There is,\n            however, an element of uncertainty as regards producers\n            demand for investment loans."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Agricultural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay - Agricultural\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/03/726406/uruguay-agricultural-development-project","projn":"UY-Livestock & Agric.
