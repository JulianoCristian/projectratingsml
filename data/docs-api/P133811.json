Some lessons\n            learned included: Yemen\u0092s geographical conditions are\n            treacherous and unique in the region. While the project\n            benefitted from lessons of experience and ongoing ISP\n            support, the operational trade-offs and administrative\n            procedures should have been capable of responding to the\n            local conditions. Inadequate attention was given to the\n            delays in payments, lack of alternative payment distribution\n            mechanisms in remote locations, and readiness of local\n            organizations (or payment agents). The project suffered\n            throughout, especially in the first 6 months, due to delayed\n            funds transfer from Ministry of Finance, or MOF. The project\n            team was highly concerned with regard to the lack of funds\n            from MOF upfront before the project negotiation. The\n            Government expressed concern of the fact that the cash\n            benefits may not be utilized for the intended purposes and\n            may not be making much development impact on the\n            beneficiaries. The Bank team did not push hard for\n            beneficiary assessment or designing the impact study, thus\n            it is hard to reconcile beyond the objective of distributing\n            cash. With another upcoming unconditional cash-transfer\n            project, it is critical to consult with the Government and\n            ensure that funds are allocated for an impact study and\n            efforts are made early to prepare for it."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen, Republic of -
