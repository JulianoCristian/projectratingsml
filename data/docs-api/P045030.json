The\n            Second Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program (FRDP\n            11) had the following ratings: unsatisfactory outcome,\n            likely sustainability, modest institutional development\n            impact, unsatisfactory Bank performance The First Fiscal\n            Restructuring and Deregulation Program (FRDP I), and\n            unsatisfactory Borrower performance. The Third Fiscal\n            Restructuring and Deregulation Program (FRDP 111) had the\n            following ratings: highly unsatisfactory outcome, unlikely\n            sustainability, negligible institutional development impact,\n            highly unsatisfactory Bank performance, and highly\n            unsatisfactory Borrower performance.

The\n            experience in these projects highlights the following\n            lessons: (a) incentives within the Bank can motivate unwise\n            lending; (b) the region's macroeconomic assessments\n            need to have greater realism and consistency; (c)\n            policy-based lending in an unstable macroeconomic\n            environment is unwise; (d) in promoting reform, the Bank\n            needs to take account of the incentives that a program\n            creates; and (e) the Bank should structure lending to Malawi\n            with more earmarked, targeted aid, and tighter fiduciary controls."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -
