Some lessons learned includes: Project\n            Development Objectives (PDOs) and PDO indicators should be\n            commensurable to what a project can realistically attain.\n            Both the PDO and the corresponding PDO indicators were\n            defined too broadly, given the scale and scope of the\n            Project, and with too optimistic targets. A US$70 million\n            specific investment loan can contribute to address road\n            maintenance issues but cannot be expected to impact\n            sector-wide trends. This should be adequately reflected in\n            terms of project design, ensuring that objectives and\n            indicators are coherent with the project's capacity to\n            deliver. If needed, complementary instruments should be\n            adopted to address broader sector-wide issues identified by\n            the borrower. Fast-track preparation projects should include\n            significant flexibility in their design so as to become\n            quickly operational: although the project was prepared\n            rapidly, this implied that some of the preparatory work\n            typically: engineering designs that should have been\n            undertaken prior to project approval were actually carried\n            out in the first years of implementation. An early\n            understanding of the particularities of a market can avoid\n            procurement-related delays further down the road. In the\n            case of this operation, an earlier identification of the\n            specific characteristics of the Uruguayan construction\n            market, and the consequent adaptation of standard Bank\n            qualification criteria applied in bidding documents, could\n            have avoided some of the delays encountered during\n            implementation. Ensuring adequate financing for maintenance\n            remains a challenge and future Bank engagement in the sector\n            should focus on this issue. Sector financing still faces\n            strong restrictions; budget allocations cannot account for\n            sector needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Transport Infrastructure\n

The restructuring will enable the\n            completion of road and bridge works that were part of the\n            Forest Products Transport Project (FPTP) but could not be\n            completed before loan closure in April 2006, because of\n            severe fiscal space restrictions that constrained the\n            Ministerio de Transporte y Obras Publicas (MTOP) budget.\n            These budgetary constraints were triggered by the compliance\n            of targets agreed between Uruguay and International Monetary\n            Fund (IMF), as part of a program to improve the fiscal\n            situation of the country which was highly affected by the\n            Argentine macroeconomic crisis. One direct implication is\n            that several capital investments planned could not take\n            place or were delayed due to uncertainty in budget\n            allocation, as priority was given to the maintenance of\n            existing roads which were key to the economy. Loan 4204 was\n            amended to help the country deal with the crisis. As a\n            result, some road and bridge works initially planned under\n            Loan 4204 could not be undertaken before the approval of the\n            new budget in March 2006. The changes in the Project's\n            design have high priority and are consistent with the\n            original project objective. These changes consist of\n            replacing a number of sub-projects included in schedule two\n            to the loan agreement and annex C to the implementation\n            letter with roads that had originally been part of loan 4204\n            and were not completed because of budgetary restrictions.\n            The works initially planned under the loan agreement and\n            being replaced will be undertaken later in the period\n            2005-2010 by the Borrower using other sources of funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Transport Infrastructure\n
