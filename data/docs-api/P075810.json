For the NWFP Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project, project outcome is moderately\n            satisfactory; sustainability is likely; institutional\n            development impact is modest; overall Bank performance is\n            satisfactory; and overall Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. For the NFWP Community Infrastructure Project,\n            project outcome is moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability\n            is unlikely; institutional development impact is modest;\n            overall Bank performance is unsatisfactory; and overall\n            Borrower performance is unsatisfactory. The main lessons\n            from these projects are: 1) Operations at the sub-national\n            level are a useful complement to those at the national\n            level. In terms of contributing to improved delivery of\n            service and poverty reduction, they compare favorably with\n            the Social Action Program. 2) Unless the mechanisms\n            governing the financial relationships between the federal\n            and provincial governments are revised, there is little or\n            no prospect for the provinces to be able to fulfill their\n            social mandate as provided by the Constitution and the\n            devolution plan in a sustainable manner. 3) Capacity at the\n            lower level is generally very weak since power resides at\n            the center for historical reasons. The focus, content, and\n            design of sub-national operations should target capacity and\n            institutional building at that level in conjunction with the\n            transfer of responsibilities from the higher to the lower\n            level. 4) When designing sub-national operations, joint\n            discussions with the central government are indispensable\n            for success. 5) Ownership and commitment, at the political\n            as well as at the administrative level, are keys to success.\n            6) Given the weak local capacity, emphasis should be placed\n            not only on building institutional capacity and training,\n            but also on incentives to encourage staff to learn and\n            assume greater responsibility. 7) Sub-national operations\n            should be accompanied by well designed and well focused\n            technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

The lessons learned indicate that a\n            strong dialog between the Bank and the provincial government\n            at the technical as well as the cabinet level is a key to\n            success for a reform program. The Bank had been in a policy\n            dialogue with the Sindh province for about one and one half\n            years before a lending operation was formally discussed. A\n            high level champion of the policy dialog is needed to win\n            the commitment of technical level civil servants. The\n            provincial Minister of Finance and the provincial Governor\n            all sent signals to the lower levels of government which\n            secured their cooperation with the Bank at the technical\n            level. If solid borrower ownership of the reform program can\n            be established, then it is advisable to provide financial\n            support (an IDA credit) even considering the risks of\n            lending to a sub-national government preceding an election.\n            An accompanying TA project enhances the effectiveness of\n            subsequent (SACs). The Sindh province reform program is\n            comprehensive and complex and there were a number of areas\n            where sustained expertise and capacity building were\n            provided by a Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD)\n            grant. For projects that support decentralization, it is\n            important to assess beforehand the limits to which laws can\n            be reformed without approval from the central government.\n            Subsequent provincial SACs would benefit from greater donor\n            coordination. Improved coordination will help leverage\n            funding for priority activities in future phases of the\n            reform program. Initially, structural adjustment programs at\n            the provincial level should be broad-based, with increasing\n            focus over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Structural
