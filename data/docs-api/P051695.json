The lessons learned from this\n            project include: 1) Along with specific sector-level reforms\n            promoted by the federal government, the provincial efforts\n            benefited from a consistent system of fiscal incentives at\n            the national level that combined a hard budget constraint\n            and federal resistance to providing bailouts, with proactive\n            programs to support state reform. 2) Sequencing is important\n            and the PRL 2 approach is more successful and sustainable\n            for provinces that have already achieved a level of control\n            in their fiscal and debt situations. 3) Project preparation\n            should be informed by social and institutional assessment.\n            4) Participatory approaches can facilitate implementation\n            and support sustainability. 5) Emerging lessons from the\n            ongoing experience suggests that the loan design for a\n            direct relation between the Bank and the participating\n            province is important in enabling the Bank to bring to bear\n            its international experience and facilitating relations\n            between federal and provincial stakeholders. 6) The loans\n            were designed to fully disburse within 12-18 months of\n            effectiveness. Given such a time frame, it is more\n            appropriate for the programs to adopt a flexible instrument."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Provincial Reform Loan Project :\n            Rio

Projects will help the Tucuman, Rio Negro, Salta and\n            San Juan provinces to reform and restructure their\n            governments to ensure an efficient and responsive delivery\n            of public services (notably social services) within fiscally\n            sound policies. The loan will be disbursed depending on\n            successful implementation of the following reforms and\n            performance benchmarks: 1) public performance reviews will\n            assess: whether overall fiscal and debt targets were\n            reached, the composition of social sector expenditures, the\n            rationale for new borrowing to refinance old debt and/or to\n            finance priority investment programs, and the economic\n            justification for all large projects; 2) public finance\n            reforms include reestablishing provincial fiscal balance by\n            improving tax collection, reducing current government\n            expenditures - namely civil service reductions, and\n            shrinking provincial debt; 3) selected education reforms\n            include consolidating classes, controlling absenteeism,\n            reducing overhead costs, reconverting public teacher\n            training institutions, and introducing new subsidy systems\n            for private schools; benchmarks include reducing\n            non-essential personnel, improving student-teacher ratios,\n            and shifting personnel expenditures towards investment and\n            other outlays; and 4) selected health reforms include\n            separating provision and financing of public health services\n            by giving hospitals autonomy, implementing new management\n            and payment systems, improving insurance coverage by\n            identifying poor beneficiaries, defining the health package,\n            and legally implementing the new insurance system prior to\n            the last tranche release."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Four Second Provincial Reform\n            Adjustment Loan Projects - Rio
