Some lessons learned includes: outcome\n            indicators should not depend on future reports for which\n            funding are not assured. EGRGs were useful in maintaining an\n            agenda for reforms that had benefited from analytical and\n            operational work done ahead of time and for which technical\n            assistance and project support were available. Reforms that\n            had been identified and understood well ahead of time helped\n            secure support among development agencies. The EGRGs\n            experience highlighted the importance of complementary\n            technical assistance in a fragile state environment. Many of\n            the reforms aimed at supporting PFM and private sector\n            development were possible because, in parallel with the\n            budget support, the World Bank Group International Finance\n            Corporation (including IFC), provided technical assistance\n            crucially given the country's weak institutional\n            capacity to achieve results. The EGRGs were useful in\n            compensating for the unpredictability of annual aid flows\n            from more politically motivated sources of support. By\n            channeling resources through the budget, instead of through\n            projects, where Government decision-making and\n            implementation of the government structural reform agenda\n            are limited, the EGRGs instrument helped foster\n            decision-making within Government. The EGRG series benefited\n            from a mutually reinforcing partnership between the World\n            Bank and the IMF that combined efforts to attain\n            macroeconomic stability with needed structural reforms in\n            areas ranging from education and health to public financial\n            management and private sector development. The collaboration\n            between the two institutions helped craft an implementable\n            reform agenda that combined extensive technical assistance\n            and funding, supported by a continuity of involvement during\n            the most challenging times during this period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Second Economic Governance\n            Reform Grant

of a\n            programmatic series of two Economic Governance Reform Grants\n            (EGRGs) for the Republic of Guinea-Bissau. The operation\n            supports the continuation of the selective reform agenda\n            initiated by the Government in 2009 with the support of the\n            EGRG I. The reform momentum under both the Public Financial\n            Management (PFM) and the Private Sector Development (PSD)\n            planks has been sustained. The PFM plank aims at\n            consolidating the setting up of a modern legal framework for\n            public financial management that is consistent with the West\n            African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) standards, and\n            promoting compliance with this legal framework through\n            systems, controls and operational reforms. The PSD plank\n            aims at consolidating the setting up of a modern legal\n            framework for private investment and improving the\n            administrative environment for business. Both PFM and PSD\n            reforms are needed jointly to restore confidence in public\n            policy and institutions and support macroeconomic stability.\n            The design of the reform program builds on analytical work\n            in these two areas and leverages activities supported by\n            other International Development Association (IDA)-funded\n            instruments, including Low Income Countries Under Stress\n            (LICUS) and State and Peace-building Fund (SPF) grant funded\n            operations and the IDA Private Sector Rehabilitation and\n            Development Project (PSRDP). The operation also complements\n            support provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB),\n            Portugal, the European Union (EU), the International\n            Monetary Fund (IMF),
