The Bank amended the\n            single stage feasibility study approach and introduced\n            resource assessment as an initial phase. At appraisal the\n            sequence between resource assessment and the design of the\n            industrial feasibility study should be acknowledged and\n            hence formulation of a detailed industrial feasibility study\n            aiming at a specific development target (pulp mill) should\n            be avoided. Research responsibility should not be given to\n            the project unit which was neither equipped nor interested\n            in this specific field. Instead, the research program should\n            be made an integral part of the Pakistan Forest( PFI)\n            program. The appointment process of consultants should have\n            started soon after appraisal and appointments confirmed\n            before credit effectiveness. The fact that the nature of the\n            project changed considerably during implementation, due to\n            the finding that resources were insufficient to support a\n            pulpmill, should be seen as a positive step since the\n            establishment of a pulpmill would have been uneconomic. The\n            supervision missions which insisted on further assessments\n            of the resource base should be credited for that approach."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Hazara Forestry Pre-investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -

resources of the Hazara region of the North West\n            Frontier Province (NWFP). To that end, the project would\n            help to develop improved technologies in reforestation,\n            reinforce the Forest Department of the NWFP and other\n            agencies, and prepare follow-up projects for large-scale\n            reforestation and an integrated pulp and paper industry. The\n            project would: select suitable areas for large-scale\n            reforestation by systematic site assessment; update\n            inventory of existing forests; plant 2,000 ha of pilot\n            plantations with back-up research trials and a genetic\n            improvement program; finance a training program; develop\n            work arrangements to embrace private small-scale forest\n            owners in future development; finance pulping tests and a\n            feasibility study to define the type, configuration and\n            timing of pulp and paper industrial development; and set up\n            a management unit to coordinate activities and prepare\n            follow-up projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Technical annexes"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Hazara Forestry\n            Pre-investment Project (Vol. 2) : Technical annexes"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1977/10/1788064/pakistan-hazara-forestry-pre-investment-project-vol-2-technical-annexes","projn":"PK-Hazara Forestry Prei -- P010116","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Forests and Forestry,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Wood Manufacturing and Industry,Forestry","teratopic":"Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0205220412350"},"subsc":"Forestry","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Industry,Agriculture,Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"afforestation,Agriculture,breeding,Capital\n            Costs,Conservator of Forests,diseases,feasibility\n            studies,Felling,Fertilizers,Fiber Pulp,Forest,Forest\n            Department,Forest Industries,forest industry,Forest\n            Institute,FOREST INVENTORY,forest lands,forest\n            manager,Forest Officer,Forest Owners,forest\n            plantations,forest resource,forest resources,forest\n            users,Foresters,Forestry,Forestry,forestry\n            activities,Forestry\n            Development,Furniture,hardwood,Irrigation,kraft pulp,land use,logging,logs,"},"1":{"cdata!":"afforestation,Agriculture,breeding,Capital\n            Costs,Conservator of Forests,diseases,feasibility\n            studies,Felling,Fertilizers,Fiber Pulp,Forest,Forest\n            Department,Forest Industries,forest industry,Forest\n            Institute,FOREST INVENTORY,forest lands,forest\n            manager,Forest Officer,Forest Owners,forest\n            plantations,forest resource,forest resources,forest\n            users,Foresters,Forestry,Forestry,forestry\n            activities,Forestry\n            Development,Furniture,hardwood,Irrigation,kraft pulp,land use,logging,logs,"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"P2147"},"facets":{}}}
