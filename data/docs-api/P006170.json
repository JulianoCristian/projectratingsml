Lessons learned include: 1) it is difficult to\n            implement a complex and comprehensive technical assistance\n            project through more than one change in administration. In\n            addition to shifts in philosophy and basic strategies, each\n            change in administration can bring changes in priorities,\n            personnel, and the roles of different Government agencies.\n            The lack of continuity resulting from these changes results\n            in slow progress; 2) government commitment, general\n            policies, priorities, sectoral objectives and manpower needs\n            must be clearly defined and monitored for such a program to\n            be implemented successfully and in a timely manner; 3) the\n            success of certain reform programs is dependent on the\n            environment in which the reform takes place. As\n            institutional strengthening aims at changing the behavior of\n            institutions and the personnel in these institutions,\n            introduction of change is often in conflict with existing\n            norms and may threaten the informal institutional culture;\n            and 4) to effect capacity building and strengthening\n            activities, an adaptive approach has to be taken. A great\n            deal of flexibility is required, especially in a politically\n            sensitive environment, and the process is lengthy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Economic Management
