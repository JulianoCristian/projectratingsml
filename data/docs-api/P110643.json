Some lessons\n            learned included: the Bank can maximize its development\n            impact by concentrating its strategic engagement including\n            its lending and advisory support in sectors with track\n            records of success. A well-designed programmatic DPL can be\n            a key instrument in the Bank's long-term engagement.\n            The DPL instrument can leverage the Bank\u2019s strengths on\n            technical advice, convening power, and credibility to help\n            support sector reforms that can have substantial impacts.\n            Prior actions should focus selectively on those reforms that\n            are critical to achieving project objectives but are\n            difficult to undertake because of political or institutional\n            resistance. Prior actions should also ensure that they are\n            additional to what will occur in the absence of the DPL\n            operation. DPLs can achieve good outcomes when they serve as\n            the culmination of a process of engagement, as in the\n            electricity sector in Turkey. A comprehensive yet well\n            integrated set of market reforms can provide credible\n            signals and incentives to private investors. Changing laws\n            and regulations may not have much impact on environmental\n            outcomes when environmental management agencies are weak and\n            lack implementation and enforcement capacity. A Bank DPL may\n            have little additional impact if the design does not fully\n            incorporate the existing political and institutional motivations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

   the borrower being deemed satisfactory as well.

All three\n            intermediate outcome indicators were completely achieved.\n            Significant lessons learned during implementation of the\n            programs include: 1) the use of a Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL) was a strategic choice of instrument after an\n            extensive and substantial engagement of investment lending\n            and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) work in the\n            energy sector; 2) proactive use of the flexibility in the\n            country partnership strategy process and the DPL instrument\n            were very important in order to adapt to both external and\n            internal political economy factors; 3) the flexibility of\n            the DPL instrument was utilized to maximum effect and longer\n            term benefit when the scope of the original energy DPL\n            program was extended to climate change and environmental\n            management in response to the government's readiness to\n            raise the dialogue on these important cross-cutting\n            development themes to a significantly higher level with the\n            international community including the Bank; 4) even with the\n            strongest commitment, sometimes reforms cannot be\n            implemented according to the original schedules; and 5) a\n            DPL that cuts across several themes brings considerable\n            additional complexity in the design but at the same time\n            results in high pay-off as it pursues a more holistic

Programmatic Electricity\n            Development Policy Loan Program (PEDPL-1) for Turkey\n            supports the implementation of the Government's program\n            for the electricity sector. The Second Programmatic\n            Electricity Development Policy Loan (PEDPL-2) will build\n            upon the initial implementation of the program. The loan is\n            one of the cornerstones of the Country Partnership Strategy\n            (CPS) FY08-11 which fully integrates the Bank's\n            activities for FY08-11 into the Government's ninth\n            development plan. Measures undertaken by the Turkish\n            administration and supported under the program are expected\n            to contribute to sustaining the growth experienced by Turkey\n            since 2002, generating employment, supporting the\n            competitiveness of Turkish industry, and improving the\n            living standards of its people. The program carries several\n            risks. From the macroeconomic side, Turkey faces economic\n            challenges as a result of the global financial crisis. In\n            particular, high external financing needs, mainly in the\n            private sector, make Turkey vulnerable to persisting\n            international illiquidity and capital outflows. While a\n            single-party Government with a strong parliamentary majority\n            creates a favorable environment for reform, some political\n            risks to the program remain, including: (i) continuing\n            domestic political differences; and (ii) geopolitical events\n            in neighboring regions. On the program side, all PEDPL-1\n            supported reforms have been implemented, and the risk of\n            reversal is low. However, there are sector specific risks:\n            delays in implementation of the remaining envisaged reforms,\n            delays in attracting private investment, slow progress of\n            energy efficiency measures contributing to continuing high\n            electricity demand growth, and external developments that\n            result in the policy actions failing to achieve a\n            significant level of improvement in the electricity supply\n            demand imbalance"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - First Programmatic Electricity\n            Sector Development Policy Loan
