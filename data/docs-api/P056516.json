It covers about 400km\n            and is China's main agricultural region. The soil of\n            the North China Plain is fertile, but water scarcity is a\n            growing problem. In many areas, increasing agricultural\n            demands can no longer be met by adding hydraulic\n            infrastructure such as storage reservoirs, and groundwater\n            is over-exploited. Water supplies to agriculture are under\n            mounting stress from competing demands for municipal and\n            industrial uses. The problem of water scarcity is compounded\n            by worsening water pollution from heavy industrialization\n            and rapid urban population growth. It is increasingly\n            realized that future growth in agricultural water demand can\n            only partly be covered by the additional development of\n            water resources or possibly by costly water transfer\n            projects that would bring water from the relatively\n            water-rich south to the north.

Lessons learned\n            included: 1) Where the correct responses to water stress are\n            not evident, a demonstration project linked to decision\n            making about broader policy and investment is a powerful\n            approach. It is recommended that, where the institutional\n            conditions are right, innovations in water resource\n            management should be tested through a demonstration project,\n            and then scaled up; 2) A comprehensive approach giving\n            priority to farmer incentives can increase farmer incomes\n            and reduce water consumption; 3) The success of water users\n            association (WUAs) stems, in part, from the clear\n            establishment principles adopted: democratic self organized\n            Associations based on hydraulic boundaries, measuring and\n            charging for water on a volumetric basis. Other factors in\n            success were: (a) flexibility in approach and adaptation to\n            local social, economic and political conditions; (b) the\n            inclusion of farmers from the very start in sub-project\n            design, so that the Associations grew as the sub-project\n            developed; (c) the transfer to the Associations of real\n            control and responsibility over water structures; (d) the\n            incentive framework, with farmers in Associations seeing\n            their incomes rise significantly faster; and (e) the\n            commitment and enthusiasm of both the Ministry of Water\n            Resources and local government; 4) The approach targeting\n            reduction in consumptive water use and based on\n            evapo-transpiration can be a powerful instrument for water\n            management in conditions of extreme water stress."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Water Conservation

Mitigating measures suggest\n            that, through the adoption of water-saving irrigation, water\n            volumes will be reduced, and groundwater recharges will also\n            be reduced, in particular, water leaching will not penetrate\n            groundwater, which is the main cause of pesticide mobility.\n            Although civil works will generate spoils, their impact will\n            be reduced by back filling the excavated areas following\n            pipe laying, and land leveling, and, water, and soil\n            conservation, will be improved to optimize the medium, and\n            low agricultural land yields. Dust pollution will be avoided\n            during the windy dry period of Spring; similarly,\n            construction works will be avoided during the rainy season,\n            to control water and soil losses, and prevent excessive\n            drainage. It is estimated that the project will improve the\n            livelihoods of the local population, and the establishment\n            of a water user authority will help improve management practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Annex of PIP report - Qingdao Project Office\n            of Water-saving"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Water Conservation\n            Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 4) : Annex of PIP\n            report - Qingdao Project Office of Water-saving"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/07/692825/china-water-conservation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-4-annex-pip-report-qingdao-project-office-water-saving","projn":"CN-Water Conservation -- P056516","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"China Institute of Water Resources and\n            Hydropower Research"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00103105332093"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Irrigation and drainage,Forestry,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,animal\n            husbandry,canals,certain extent,Construction,discharge,drip\n            irrigation,driven wells,drought,economic\n            conditions,employment,environmental management,environmental\n            monitoring,environmental problems,environmental\n            protection,environmental quality,Evaluation\n            criteria,farmers,farming,forestry,fresh\n            water,groundwater,groundwater quality,income,irrigation\n            development,Irrigation Water,lakes,land resources,local\n            water,monitoring_ Equipment,nutrients,oil,organic\n            matter,pesticides,pipeline,pollution,production\n            technology,pump stations,quality of water,quantity of\n            water,reservoirs,scientific research,Sea,seePage,social\n            economy,soil fertility,solid wastes,spring,storage\n            capacity,surface runoff,surface water,surface water\n            resources,sustainable development,town,towns,tree\n            seedlings,Water Conservation,Water Law,water quality,water\n            quantity,water replenishment,water resources\n            management,water shortage,water supply,water use,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,animal\n            husbandry,canals,certain extent,Construction,discharge,drip\n            irrigation,driven wells,drought,economic\n            conditions,employment,environmental management,environmental\n            monitoring,environmental problems,environmental\n            protection,environmental quality,Evaluation\n            criteria,farmers,farming,forestry,fresh\n            water,groundwater,groundwater quality,income,irrigation\n            development,Irrigation Water,lakes,land resources,local\n            water,monitoring_ Equipment,nutrients,oil,organic\n            matter,pesticides,pipeline,pollution,production\n            technology,pump stations,quality of water,quantity of\n            water,reservoirs,scientific research,Sea,seePage,social\n            economy,soil fertility,solid wastes,spring,storage\n            capacity,surface runoff,surface water,surface water\n            resources,sustainable development,town,towns,tree\n            seedlings,Water Conservation,Water Law,water quality,water\n            quantity,water replenishment,water resources\n            management,water shortage,water supply,water use,wells"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF027027-PHRD-TARIM BASIN II PROJECT (BANK-EXECUTED),TF025417-PHRD-WATER CONSERVATION PROJECT(BANK-EXEC),TF025732-PHRD-WATER CONSERVATION PROJ.(RECIPIENT-EXEC.)","repnb":"E341"},"facets":{}}}
