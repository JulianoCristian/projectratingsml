Some lessons learned\n            included: 1. Participatory design is key to promoting\n            ownership. By actively involving target communities in the\n            identification of problems and their solutions, and vesting\n            them with the responsibility for implementing the agreed\n            investments, the project fostered ownership on the part of\n            the local beneficiaries from the very start. It demonstrated\n            that when communities are given the opportunity to be at the\n            center of the decision-making process, they feel a greater\n            sense of responsibility to make things work and succeed. 2.\n            A flexible approach allows timely adaptations to changing\n            needs and circumstances. One reason that the project\n            performed well was the built-in flexibility to allow for\n            rapid adaptations to changing needs and circumstances. 3.\n            Establishing a direct link between natural resource\n            rehabilitation and tangible economic and social benefits is\n            critical for increased uptake of natural resource management\n            activities. 4. Dissemination of information through public\n            awareness programs is crucial for the widespread adoption of\n            new practices and technologies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

Anatolia Watershed Rehabilitation Project for Turkey is to\n            support sustainable natural resource management practices in\n            28 micro-catchments in Anatolia and Turkey's Black Sea\n            Region and thereby raise incomes of  communities affected by\n            resource degradation. The proposed project will build and\n            expand on a community-based approach to natural resource\n            management. The project has five components.   Component 1:\n            Rehabilitation of degraded natural resources The\n            component's primary objective is to protect degraded\n            areas from further degradation, erosion and pollution.\n            Rehabilitation interventions are focused around four\n            sub-components 1) The main sub-components are as follows: 1)\n            Rehabilitation of forest land including soil conservation by\n            afforestation, protection and improvement of  poor &\n            degraded soils, gallery plantation, rehabilitation of  oak\n            coppices and of  degraded high forests, participatory\n            replanting and inventory of non-wood forest products; 2)\n            Rangeland rehabilitation, including improved management of\n            forest rangelands and rehabilitation activities on rangeland\n            outside the forest land; 3) Rehabilitation of agricultural\n            land, including: fallow reduction, appropriate use of\n            marginal agricultural land, wild tree grafting, river bank\n            protection, and construction and production on agricultural\n            terraces; and  4) Environment-friendly agricultural\n            practices, including demonstrations of  improved crop\n            production practices, organic farming and integrated pest\n            management and nutrient reduction activities implemented.\n            Component 2 supports Income generating activities designed\n            to provide participating communities with the incentives to\n            undertake conservation efforts.  Component 3 strengthens\n            policy and regulatory capacity towards meeting EU Standards\n            including support for the application of the EU Nitrates\n            Directive, development and promotion of a code of good\n            agricultural practices, and institutional support for\n            organic farming. Component 4 supports awareness raising in\n            micro-catchment development, capacity building and\n            replication strategy. Component 5 supports project\n            management and support services, including a fund for\n            applied research and technology dissemination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Anatolia
