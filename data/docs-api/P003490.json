The main objective of the project was to\n            increase agricultural productivity and farm incomes in\n            Xinjiang, one of the poorer and less developed areas in\n            China, through investment in irrigation, rural\n            infrastructure, and agricultural support services on state\n            farms. The project substantially achieved the objective of\n            agricultural growth and diversification in Xinjiang, and\n            partially achieved secondary goals related to training.\n            Overall, the agro-processing factories have performed well\n            and have met their expected production targets and rates of\n            return. However, some of the factories experienced initial\n            problems with raw material availability, changing market\n            conditions, and adequate working capital. IDA's\n            performance in identification, preparation, and appraisal of\n            the project is viewed as satisfactory to highly\n            satisfactory. IDA's performance in supervision was also\n            satisfactory. The borrower's performance in project\n            preparation and implementation was also generally\n            satisfactory. The project's outcome is viewed as\n            satisfactory, since the first and most important objective\n            of agricultural growth and diversification in Xinjiang was\n            achieved with a relatively high degree of sustainability.\n            The main lessons learned from the project include the\n            following: (a) the estimated annual amount of counterpart\n            funding necessary for the project should be identified and\n            discussed with the Borrower at appraisal in order to ensure\n            that proper attention will be paid to project financing\n            arrangements; (b) The Borrower should solicit advice from\n            technical experts during project preparation; (c) Both the\n            Borrower and the World Bank should pay greater attention\n            during project supervision to the construction and\n            commissioning of waste water treatment facilities for\n            agro-processing sub-projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Xinjiang Agricultural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Xinjiang Agricultural\n            Development

20 state farms in Northern Xinjiang.\n            Specifically, it will construct irrigation works on 32,300\n            ha to be planted with food, fiber and fodder crops; improve\n            44,700 ha of rainfed pasture through fertilizing, fencing\n            and seeding; and introduce improved animal breeds.  To\n            handle the increased production of raw materials, the\n            project will construct and equip agroprocessing facilities\n            such as cottonseed oil processing plants, wool processing\n            plants, slaughterhouses and raisin production facilities.\n            In addition to agroprocessing equipment, the project will\n            provide tractors, combine harvesters, balers, silage\n            equipment, scrapers with laser-control, bulldozers, fuel\n            tankers and refrigerated trunks.
