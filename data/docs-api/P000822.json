Some lessons\n            learned included: the formulation of a national gender\n            policy to provide strategic direction for future efforts was\n            timely and appropriate. However, the policy would need to be\n            periodically reviewed and aligned, monitored and evaluated,\n            so as to retain its relevance and usefulness. The\n            women's bureau has undoubtedly a lead role in this\n            process and will required support and partnership to\n            achieved desired results. The bureau's role cannot be\n            under emphasized in a gender oriented project and it is only\n            a capacitized bureau which could discharge the expected\n            functions adequately. The program content of future project\n            designs should also be so balanced to ensure that other\n            critical areas of concern to women are accordingly\n            incorporated. The non implementation of the activities\n            envisaged under the post-harvest technology sector had\n            affected the impact of the project on the lives of the\n            beneficiary women. Women in the project areas as well as\n            those outside of the project areas consistently lamented or\n            help in this sector. There is an urgent need for\n            intervention in the area of post-harvest technology\n            sub-sector, of course through a gender perspective."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gambia - Women in Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gambia -
