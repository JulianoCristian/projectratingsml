Ratings for the\n            Mainstreaming Adaption to Climate Change Project for Latin\n            America and Caribbean were as follows:  outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory;\n            and borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned includes: the United Nation (UN)\n            framework's three-stage conceptual model for sequencing\n            climate change adaptation efforts is comprehensive, but by\n            compressing so many activities in the first stage of the\n            process, it is too demanding of scarce human capital,\n            particularly in small developing country contexts with\n            limited absorptive capacities. Adapting to climate change is\n            a complex and multi-sectoral challenge requiring an\n            integrated and collaborative approach. However, this does\n            not have to be done all at once or within a single project\n            if doing so makes implementation unmanageable. Getting a few\n            things right is better than trying to do too much and losing\n            project focus in the process, as happened in this series of\n            projects. Building complementary institutional and technical\n            capacities at both the regional and national levels can have\n            synergistic effects unachievable by pursuing tasks at either\n            level alone. There are areas of significant overlap found\n            between disaster risk management and climate change\n            adaptation efforts. It is important that each focus on\n            specific core tasks where they have comparative advantages\n            of expertise and experience, but they also need to find\n            areas where their common objective of reducing\n            climate-related risks in both the short- and long-run can\n            produce mutual benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and Caribbean -
