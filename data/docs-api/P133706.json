Additionally, the Bank\n            performance and borrower performance were also rated highly\n            satisfactory. The risk to development outcome is moderate.\n            Several lessons were learned.  Implementation of complex\n            operations requires a heavy commitment to coordination\n            within the Bank, the bridge financier, and with the\n            government. A systematic, written approach, which included\n            arrears documentation clearance, was useful. Significant\n            time was needed in walking the client through the process.\n            Having a staff member close at hand and available was\n            critical. In future reengagement cases, it might be useful\n            to ensure that a decentralized task team leader is available\n            for the government. Although expected outcomes were met, it\n            would be appropriate to reevaluate continued progress over a\n            longer period of time to minimize risks of backsliding.\n            There is no easy solution to coordination challenges in\n            managing the receipt of development assistance, but a\n            generalized willingness among development partners to pool\n            resources and approaches in order to reduce aid transactions\n            costs, including via a shared program of prior actions is\n            notable.  The urgent necessity of clearing arrears to IDA\n            dictated the choice of instrument, and in particular the use\n            of a single-tranche standalone DPO. This imposed limitations\n            on the effectiveness of the instrument as a platform for\n            sustained policy dialogue. A balance needed to be struck at\n            the time of preparation between responding efficiently to a\n            limited window of opportunity, versus establishing a longer\n            term platform for policy dialogue. Thus the next and logical\n            step would be for the preparation of a programmatic DPO\n            series that might provide a more effective mechanism for\n            engaging with the authorities on macroeconomic policy\n            dialogue over a longer, multi-year reform period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Myanmar - Reengagement and Reform Support

It will be a\n            standalone development policy operation (DPO) program aimed\n            at supporting the full normalization of relations between\n            Myanmar and the World Bank as well as the Government's\n            efforts to undertake critical institutional and policy\n            reforms in the implementation of its medium-term development\n            strategy.

Since Myanmar\n            is projected to be at a low risk of debt distress after\n            arrears clearance, IDA resources will be provided on credit\n            terms, per the stipulations of the credit allocation system\n            agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 16 period (FY12-FY14).\n            Going forward, the Government realizes that a key challenge\n            will be to ensure that these reforms translate into improved\n            living standards for the majority of the population, and\n            that gains registered are sustained. The program document is\n            divided into six sections, including this introduction.\n            Second section discusses the country context which gives an\n            overview of Myanmar focusing on the political and economic\n            context, recent economic developments, macroeconomic\n            outlook, and debt sustainability.
