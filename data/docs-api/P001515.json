However, targets for enrollment increase as\n            well as those for internal efficiency at every level, were\n            not achieved. A number of key lessons were drawn from this\n            project, mostly as it relates to decentralization, with\n            applicability to other sectors as well. The following are\n            the main lessons learned: 1) participation at all levels was\n            proven effective in project implementation, thus the\n            development of social capital, team formation, and regional\n            continuity are additional benefits derived from this\n            approach; 2) redeployment of staff at local level, i.e.,\n            within school districts, was a well proven policy option,\n            with needs for further diversification of specific\n            initiatives, such as misdistribution and underemployment of\n            staff; 3) experience suggests that management capacity has\n            to develop first at regional levels before being delegated\n            to district levels, hence a gradual planned and phased\n            approach to responsibility devolution and capacity building\n            is needed; 4) a participating local community can\n            effectively identify its own priorities and deliver\n            sustainable quality primary education, if given initiative\n            and modest resources; 5) financial and budgetary constraints\n            forced sector institutions towards efficiency and better\n            utilization of resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Education Sector Reinforcement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Education Sector\n
