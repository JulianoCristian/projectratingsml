Lessons learned\n            from the projects included: strengthening management\n            capacity does not necessarily or automatically lead to\n            improvements in environmental quality. Improving management\n            capacity focused on a well-defined and socially demanded set\n            of environmental goals would probably yield better results.\n            Environmental monitoring is a necessary but not sufficient\n            condition for improving environmental quality. Monitoring\n            programs should be designed around the demand for data by\n            decision makers rather than the simple demand for data. To\n            enhance the effectiveness of projects like EMCB, a\n            priority-setting process which involves various stakeholders\n            should precede project design and appraisal. Associated\n            lessons are that a sharper focus on environmental results\n            and a better ex ante analysis of the political economy of\n            environmental regulation could have made this a more\n            successful project with more sustainable outcomes. Finally,\n            the project also clearly demonstrates the risks of designing\n            an operation around the interests of individual\n            institutional champions, as occurred both at the central\n            Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) and in the\n            Gujarat Ecology Commission (GEC), because, once those\n            champions leave, the impetus may soon be lost. A strong\n            focus on specific desired environmental outcomes and basing\n            project design on a broader up-front stakeholder\n            consultation process would help to insulate it from the\n            kinds of abrupt changes and insufficient follow-through that\n            characterized implementation of the EMCB operation and could\n            also contribute to more effective enforcement of and\n            compliance with environmental laws and regulations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Environmental Management Capacity\n            Building Technical Assistance

results, for\n            although the project outcome is satisfactory and\n            sustainability is likely, institutional development impacts\n            were just modest, and, while the Borrower performance is\n            rated satisfactory, that of the Bank is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Some lessons of experience reinforce\n            previous notions, and are suggested as follows. Clear\n            definition of, and agreement on, a small number of\n            significant, national scale problems, is most likely to lead\n            to measurable impacts. The desired outcomes and essential\n            outputs should be articulated early during preparation;\n            components can then be designed to support this small set of\n            priorities, and should build on relevant ongoing activities\n            in order to help the Government achieve these priority\n            outcomes. Project design should generate a sense that this\n            project can make a difference. Specifically, a practical\n            balance has to reached between integrating components into\n            the regular activities of the implementing unit (which can\n            bring additional administrative burdens), and centralizing\n            control in a Project Unit, which simplifies administration\n            and reporting (but which may distance the project support\n            from the relevant operational units). This question should\n            be specifically discussed during preparation. Most\n            importantly, an effective coordinating mechanism should be\n            established, based on monitoring overall outcomes. Moreover,\n            Bank procedures for implementing capacity building projects\n            should be structured to be flexible, and to rely, wherever\n            possible, on local rules and procedures. Appropriate\n            training should be provided for key implementing staff,\n            again, at a very early stage. A significant part of the\n            value added by the Bank in capacity building, comes through\n            regular, consistent, and responsive involvement during the\n            implementation period. This requires careful planning of\n            supervision and depends on continuity of staff throughout\n            the period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Environmental Capacity Building\n            Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Environmental Capacity\n            Building Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5861779/india-environmental-capacity-building-technical-assistance-project","projn":"IN-Env Capacity Bldg Ta -- P043728","subtopic":"Health Economics & Finance,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Environmental Economics & Policies,Environmental Governance","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Poverty Reduction","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050614163544"},"theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Water resource management,Pollution management and environmental health,Decentralization,Legal institutions for a market economy","subsc":"Other social services,Law and justice,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Mining and other extractive","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment,Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Air, Air Pollution, air quality, cities,\n            coastal management, Competitive Bidding, compliance\n            monitoring, corrective actions, decision making, dividends,\n            Ecology, effective implementation, Effluents, Emission\n            Standards, emissions, employment, Environment Program,\n            environmental assessments, environmental awareness,\n            environmental concerns, environmental degradation,\n            Environmental Economics, Environmental Economists,\n            environmental education, environmental health, Environmental\n            Information, environmental issues, environmental law,\n            environmental laws, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, Environmental\n            policies, environmental policy, environmental priorities,\n            environmental problem, environmental studies, Exchange Rate,\n            exchange rates, expenditures, Financial assistance,\n            implementation of policies, implementation process,\n            industrial emissions, Industrial Pollution, information\n            centers, information systems, land use, laws, Learning,\n            legal framework, legislation, managers, media, monitoring\n            equipment, monitoring mechanisms, monitoring system,\n            National Development, national Environmental Law,\n            non-governmental organizations, Oil, Oil Refineries, organic\n            compounds, point of view, POLICY Research, political\n            support, Pollution, Pollution Control, Pollution Prevention,\n            pollution problems, private sector, problem areas,\n            procedural requirements, professions, public access,\n            regulatory agencies, research projects, schools, social\n            services, spatial planning, teachers, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE,\n            training courses, training programs, training workshops,\n            water quality"}},"owner":"Envir & Nat.
