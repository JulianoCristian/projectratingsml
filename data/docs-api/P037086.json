The lessons learned indicate that major\n            restructuring, corporatization and privatization of a\n            utility, should provide for flexibility, as such actions are\n            often beyond the utility's control, being subject to\n            mandates which may change with a change of Government.\n            Likewise, there should be flexibility in the design and\n            implementation of components such as Demand Side Management\n            (DSM), for which the utility has had no past experience and\n            little desire to execute. Sudden economic/financial crisis\n            in a country, could severely impact power demand and could\n            render major distribution investments planned for high\n            sustained growth levels, totally unviable. Under such\n            conditions, utilities need to take timely and drastic\n            measures to restructure their investment plans, exercise\n            great financial discipline, and double efforts towards\n            improving operational efficiency. Under these circumstances,\n            the Bank would do well to take a flexible and sympathetic\n            approach to government actions and desist from demanding\n            rigid compliance with covenants. Introduction of complex\n            power pool operations in a developing country needs to be\n            thought through with care. Active support rather than\n            reluctant acquiescence of the utilities is necessary to push\n            through a complex reform agenda. The Bank could best play\n            the role of advisor and facilitator for countries that have\n            already embarked on the path of power sector reforms and\n            should recognize that restructuring proposals cannot be cast\n            in stone and could change as Government and utility thinking evolves."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand -
