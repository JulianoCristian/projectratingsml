The\n            technical base for IPM has been enhanced by field studies\n            carried out by the farmers themselves. Government actions\n            have created a policy environment more conducive to adopting\n            IPM concepts and practices. A key institutional\n            strengthening outcome was the increased motivation and\n            ability of farmers to organize themselves into local groups\n            and national associations. These gains make the project\n            outcome satisfactory, but only marginally so because the\n            project could have achieved much more. That so much was\n            achieved is due chiefly to the soundness of the IPM concepts\n            applied, the enthusiasm of field leaders, and the strong\n            field-level support by the FAO technical assistance team.\n            Overall World Bank and Borrower performances are rated\n            satisfactory. Project sustainability is likely. The full\n            impact of the project was not achieved because of quality at\n            entry and implementation problems discussed here:\n            Organizational arrangements needed to be clearly defined and\n            adjusted before, not during, project preparation. The\n            unavailability of good baseline data and the late and\n            ineffective development of an monitoring and evaluation\n            system limited the impact evaluation study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
