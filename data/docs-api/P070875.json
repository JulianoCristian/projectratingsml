Some lessons learned\n            included: multiple sources of information are required to\n            inform project management. Because of the late establishment\n            of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system and its\n            focus on land titling, the Bank and the Government had very\n            little 'real-time' information on what was\n            happening on the ground. The project needed an on-line\n            management information system (including regularly updated\n            maps), an accompanying socio-economic research agenda to\n            examine impact (given the complex Key Performance Indicator\n            (KPIs)), and a continuing process of communication with\n            Civil Society Organizations. The objectives should be kept\n            as simple as possible and should avoid including\n            vaguely-specified impacts and outcomes whose achievement\n            requires the satisfaction of conditions outside the\n            project's control. Broadly-defined outcome indicators\n            are difficult (if not impossible) to measure and show that\n            the operational aspects of Monitoring and Evaluation\n            (M&E) had not been sufficiently thought through at the\n            design stage. For a results framework to be credible, it is\n            essential to have the core elements of an M&E system\n            established before project implementation commences,\n            including having all base-line data prepared. The LMAP\n            design relied on a separate, donor-funded Informal\n            Settlements Program to be implemented in parallel to ensure\n            that the poorest and most tenure-insecure communities would\n            benefit from titling. This parallel program covered Phnom\n            Penh alone and no comparable arrangements were included\n            under LMAP to address similar issues elsewhere. This\n            introduced an unidentified risk and should have been\n            accompanied by a detailed plan for coordination between the\n            two programs in Phnom Penh and plans to develop a similar\n            arrangement for State lands elsewhere. The project's\n            design called for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to\n            play an advocacy role (in raising public awareness, bringing\n            disputes to the fore and providing legal assistance to the\n            poor), but it was unrealistic to expect that the Government\n            and NGOs will be able to engage in formal contracts. This\n            requirement, with hindsight, could have been handled via a\n            Bank-executed Trust Fund, as has been done in more recent\n            land and natural resource sector projects in Cambodia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Land Management and\n            Administration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia - Land Management and\n            Administration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15940646/cambodia-land-management-administration-project","projn":"KH-Land Management And Administration\n            Project -- P070875","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Land Use and Policies,Public Sector Management and Reform,Urban Housing","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Public Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Cambodia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20120316004734"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Tertiary education,Other industry,Law and justice","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Public Sector Development,Urban Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information, access to land,\n            administrative procedures, administrative systems,\n            agricultural land, agricultural output, agriculture, audits,\n            Bank Ratings, Banks, capacity building, communes,\n            communities, Community Participation, consolidation,\n            Construction, Construction Ministry, cultivation, Economic\n            Development, economic growth, entrepreneurship,\n            Environmental, environmental management, financial\n            institutions, Financial Management, Fisheries, fishing,\n            Forestry, improved land, income, indigenous peoples,\n            information dissemination, Institutional Development,\n            institutional reform, key performance indicators, land\n            acquisition, Land Administration, land distribution, LAND\n            MANAGEMENT, land market, land markets, land parcels, land\n            reform, Land Registration, land resources, land rights, Land\n            Taxation, land tenure, land titles, land titling, land\n            transactions, land use, land use classification, Land Use\n            Planning, land valuation, land values, landlessness,\n            landowners, laws, legal framework, local authorities,\n            logging, Municipality, natural resources, policy\n            environment, policy papers, political economy, poverty\n            reduction, Present Value, private land, Productivity,\n            property rights, Public, public administration, public\n            benefit, public good, regulatory framework, Resettlement,\n            resource allocation, resource management, rural areas, Rural\n            Development, sites, social services, Spatial Planning, state\n            lands, Statistical Analysis, structural reform, Sustainable\n            Development, sustainable growth, tax rates, Taxation,\n            Technical Assistance, towns, trust funds, urban areas, urban\n            communities, urban development, Urban Planning, urban poor,\n            urban settlements"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Sustainable Dev (EASTS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF026421-PHRD-CAMBODIA: LAND MANAGEMENT\n            AND ADMIN.

Both the 2009 Response and the\n            Panel\u0092s Report concluded that the Requesters suffered\n            serious harm or the threat of harm. The Panel and Management\n            also agree that the benefits and protections provided to BKL\n            residents by LMAP fell short of expectations and that\n            Management was unable to prevent or mitigate the harm that\n            occurred.  However, while concurring with the Panel\n            regarding a number of significant Project shortcomings,\n            Management considers it essential to characterize these\n            shortcomings properly in terms of their relationship to the\n            harm suffered by the residents of BKL. Management agrees\n            with the Panel that engagement on land issues in Cambodia is\n            highly relevant to the country\u0092s development, and is\n            consistent with the Government\u0092s long-term development\n            vision and the Bank\u0092s overall mandate of poverty reduction.\n            The current state of the dialogue with the Government on\n            these issues has diminished the Bank\u0092s ability to facilitate\n            solutions.

Finally, the requesters claim that other\n            communities in project provinces have been unable to access\n            the land titling in LMAP adjudication areas, and experienced\n            forced evictions. The issues raised involve fundamental\n            questions of land rights and tenure security of the affected\n            community.
