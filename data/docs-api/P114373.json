Some lessons learned includes: financial\n            sector reforms are relatively easy to design but difficult\n            to implement. Successful implementation depends on two\n            crucial factors: the commitment of the authorities to the\n            reform program; and the effectiveness of project\n            supervision. The Egyptian authorities have shown a strong\n            commitment to the multi-year reform program that was\n            designed by the reformist government that was appointed in\n            2004. The reform program did not include the privatization\n            of the two largest commercial banks nor the large insurance\n            companies. However, many measures were taken to improve the\n            management of these institutions, which one commentator\n            resembled to an effective 'privatization of\n            management' rather than 'privatization of\n            ownership'. A dogmatic approach to the ownership\n            question would not be justified, especially after the public\n            rescue of so many leading private banks and insurance\n            companies in high-income countries during the 2008 global\n            financial crisis. Policy based operations may require strong\n            Bank technical assistance efforts as part of the process,\n            particularly in the financial sector. Multi-trenched\n            financial sector adjustment operations are effective\n            instruments to support major financial sector reforms.\n            Achievements under the operations three policy areas thus\n            contributed substantially to the overall development outcome\n            sought by the operation: strengthen the enabling legal and\n            institutional environment for financial intermediation and\n            risk management and to increase the role and participation\n            of the private sector in the provision of financial\n            services. The most relevant lesson of this project is\n            perhaps the importance of the ownership of the reform\n            program by the authorities and their strong commitment to\n            its success. This is underscored by the second component of\n            the operation concerning the restructuring of the ailing\n            specialized public financial institutions. The key lesson\n            from these two projects was the importance of the commitment\n            of the authorities to the reform program, which was most\n            evident prior to and during the project. Without this strong\n            and effective commitment, such significant results could not\n            have been achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt, Morocco and Guatemala - First and\n

risk to development outcome\n            was Substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: the implementation challenges\n            relating to the fiscal reform component of the first and\n            second DPLs illustrate the difficulties of achieving program\n            objectives that depend on legislative approval, particularly\n            in the area of tax reform. Repeated attempts to increase\n            revenue collections through raising tax rates and expanding\n            the tax base have failed in the past, and continue to face\n            stiff opposition. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge\n            the intrinsic difficulty of implementing redistributive tax\n            reform in a highly unequal society and within a short time\n            horizon. The experience of the first and second DPLs implies\n            that the Bank could be more modest in its expectations, and\n            could foster support for reform by identifying and helping\n            build constituencies with shared interests or who stand to\n            gain from reform. Another related lesson that can be drawn\n            from the DPLs is that although the planned fiscal reforms\n            would have generated significant revenues, measures to\n            improve tax administration can also generate large revenue\n            gains, and are politically more palatable. In Guatemala,\n            introducing tax controls and modernizing tax systems not\n            only increased efficiency but had a big pay-off through\n            reducing evasion. Another lesson that can be derived from\n            the operation relates to the policy measures on increasing\n            the transparency of public trust funds. The stated objective\n            was to increase transparency in the hope that eventually\n            this would create pressure to increase oversight and efficiency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala

objectives of the Second\n            Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy\n            Loan Program for Guatemala are: i) maintain fiscal space for\n            priority spending through tax policy and tax administration\n            reforms; ii) improve governance and transparency of public\n            financial management and expenditures; and iii) improve\n            access to finance and deepen financial markets through\n            reforms to the financial legal framework and public debt\n            management. The operation builds on the progress made under\n            the First Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy Loan\n            (DPL) and supports the country's strategic program to\n            strengthen Guatemala's capacity to grow and provide\n            adequate resources to reduce poverty and inequality.\n            Progress on critical reforms is being made, including\n            strengthening tax administration, promoting financial market\n            stability, improving monitoring and evaluation of the\n            country's new conditional cash transfer program,\n            modernizing customs processes, as well as enhancing\n            governance and transparency. In response to the global\n            crisis and economic slowdown, the Government has prioritized\n            its development plan on near term steps to mitigate the\n            impact of global crisis, including focusing efforts on\n            expanding its new conditional cash transfer program and\n            creating a task force to monitor the economic situation and\n            take policy actions, as needed, to respond to the crisis.\n            The Government has adjusted its reform program to reflect\n            additional actions and priorities, including reforms to\n            increase access to finance and address financial sector\n            stability, while other actions anticipated by the Government\n            prior to the crisis, particularly implementation of measures\n            to boost tax collections, have been delayed. Guatemala made\n            steady progress on the transparency and financial management\n            in recent years. The implementation of the integrated\n            financial management system (SIAF), which was built upon a\n            good normative framework and a modern technological\n            platform, contributed to efficiency in financial\n            transactions and the production of timely, transparent\n            information on most government finances."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Second
