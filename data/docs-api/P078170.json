- Road Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Road Maintenance and\n            Rehabilitation Project for Poland were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: with\n            regard to the road components, the Government was successful\n            in utilizing the country's regional apparatus. The Bank\n            approved the medium-term investment plan of the implementing\n            agency (MoI/MoT) on the basis of its prior public\n            expenditure review and use of HDM-4 (HDM-4 is a software\n            tool for the analysis, planning, management and appraisal of\n            road maintenance, improvements and investment decisions), a\n            rigorous tool for ensuring that investment priorities will\n            be based on economic reasoning. The road components, the\n            great majority of the projects' funds were quick\n            disbursing, with more than $100 million having been\n            disbursed in about half a year in each case. Mixing\n            quick-disbursing operations with capacity building risks\n            disappointment. It was logical for the Bank to offer\n            relatively large, quick-disbursing support to a part of the\n            infrastructure that is perennially a poor cousin:\n            maintenance and rehabilitation, because the new economy of\n            the enlarged European Union (EU) is very much reliant on\n            intra-EU trade and much of that trade is road-based; and\n            because mobility is a fairly high priority among consumption\n            goals in new middle income countries. However, institutional\n            change is never rapid, even in a literate, educated country,\n            especially during a period of political instability. It may\n            be tempting to hope that the fast-disbursing elements of a\n            project will generate leverage to induce institutional\n            change, but success is far from assured. Since the first of\n            these loans, the Bank has rightly increased emphasis on\n            results as the central criterion for evaluating success and\n            hence for orienting management attention, 'what gets\n            measured gets managed' both in the Bank and in the\n            borrower's administration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Road Maintenance and

Notwithstanding,\n            the review carried out for the purpose of this report\n            demonstrates a considerable overlap of two systems, despite\n            the following differences in the approaches, and measures:\n            1) both the Polish system and the Bank classify projects to\n            different categories, depending on the extent of their\n            environmental impact; 2) in the Bank procedure, the scope,\n            and requirements of environmental assessments (EA) depends\n            on the project category - full EA for Category A, and\n            limited for Category B projects; 3) public participation is\n            initiated at a later stage under the Polish procedure.\n            Despite improved EA practices in Poland, some problems\n            reveal insufficient expertise on lower administration\n            levels, insufficient quality, and often, changes in EA\n            regulations have caused problems at county, and municipal\n            levels, with little time to adapt to such changes.

Notwithstanding,\n            the review carried out for the purpose of this report\n            demonstrates a considerable overlap of two systems, despite\n            the following differences in the approaches, and measures:\n            1) both the Polish system and the Bank classify projects to\n            different categories, depending on the extent of their\n            environmental impact; 2) in the Bank procedure, the scope,\n            and requirements of environmental assessments (EA) depends\n            on the project category - full EA for Category A, and\n            limited for Category B projects; 3) public participation is\n            initiated at a later stage under the Polish procedure.\n            Despite improved EA practices in Poland, some problems\n            reveal insufficient expertise on lower administration\n            levels, insufficient quality, and often, changes in EA\n            regulations have caused problems at county, and municipal\n            levels, with little time to adapt to such changes. This EA\n            contains a comparison (Polish and Bank system) table of\n            project types, subject to an environmental assessment,\n            highlighting mitigation measures concerning aquaculture\n            aspects; dams and reservoirs; forestry projects, as well as\n            deforestation issues; hazardous waste management and\n            disposal; large scale industrial plants; irrigation,\n            drainage, and flood control issues; Land clearance and\n            leveling aspects; manufacture, transportation, and use of\n            pesticides, or other hazardous materials; mineral\n            development, including oil and gas; river basin development;\n            power and hydropower development or expansion; water supply\n            and wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal; and\n            finally, mitigation on construction of major highways of\n            rural roads. The Project Operational Manual (volume 2)\n            provides specific mitigation measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment - comparisons of\n            Poland and Bank's policies and procedures"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Third Roads Project :\n            environmental assessment : Environmental assessment -\n            comparisons of Poland and Bank's policies and procedures"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/2896310/poland-third-roads-project-environmental-assessment-environmental-assessment-comparisons-poland-banks-policies-procedures","projn":"PL-Road Maintenance & Rehabilitation\n            Project -- P078170","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Urban Services to the Poor,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Poland","authors":{"authr":"Regional Environmental Center for Central\n            and Eastern Europe; and, Jendroska, Jerzy; Koziarek,\n            Malgorzata; Rzeszot, Urszula; Wiszniewska, Beata;"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20040211162558"},"subsc":"Roads and highways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to information,accidents,air,arable\n            land,asbestos,cities,decision\n            making,decision-making,disclosure,energy\n            efficiency,environmental impacts,environmental\n            information,Environmental Management,Environmental\n            Protection,environmental quality,environmental quality\n            standards,family planning,fisheries,food\n            processing,forestry,hazardous waste management,housing,land\n            use,laws,legislation,marketing,municipalities,natural\n            resources,nutrition,pollution,professional\n            practice,prognosis,programs,Public participation,Quality\n            control,Roads,safety,Screening,telecommunications,waste,waste\n            management,wastes,water supply,watershed,wetlands"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to information,accidents,air,arable\n            land,asbestos,cities,decision\n            making,decision-making,disclosure,energy\n            efficiency,environmental impacts,environmental\n            information,Environmental Management,Environmental\n            Protection,environmental quality,environmental quality\n            standards,family planning,fisheries,food\n            processing,forestry,hazardous waste management,housing,land\n            use,laws,legislation,marketing,municipalities,natural\n            resources,nutrition,pollution,professional\n            practice,prognosis,programs,Public participation,Quality\n            control,Roads,safety,Screening,telecommunications,waste,waste\n            management,wastes,water supply,watershed,wetlands"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF021141-EC METAP-ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PROJECT","repnb":"E847"},"facets":{}}}
