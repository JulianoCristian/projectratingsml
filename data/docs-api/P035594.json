To the joint credit of the Bank and the\n            Chadian Government, however, actions were taken in the\n            second part of 1994 to remedy the short comings observed\n            earlier.

decision of the African member countries of\n            the Franc Zone to devalue their currency, the CFA franc,\n            effective January 12, 1994. The Economic Recovery Credit\n            Project will support the post-devluation reform program as\n            outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policy whose main objectives are to restore order to\n            public finances and to lay the basis for growth and the\n            alleviation of poverty. More particularly, it will support\n            the measures aimed at minimizing the negative social impact\n            of the devaluation in the short term. The Chadian Government\n            has already taken a series of key macroeconomic and\n            structural measures to regain and consolidate\n            competitiveness, and to stabilize its public finances. The\n            Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) is designed to support the\n            implementation of these measures in 1994. The major measures\n            are: (i) the devaluation of the CFA Franc from 50 CFAF to\n            100 CFAF/1 FF; (ii) prudent demand management policies to\n            reduce absorption by the public sector and limit wage\n            increases; (iii) budget reform and strengthening of tax\n            collection; (iv) increase in the producer price of cotton\n            for the 1994/95 crop by 50; (v) a program of social measures\n            to attenuate the effects of the devaluation on vulnerable\n            groups; and (vi) protection of social sector

The Economic Recovery Credit\n            Project will support the post-devluation reform program as\n            outlined in the Government's Statement of Economic and\n            Social Policy whose main objectives are to restore order to\n            public finances and to lay the basis for growth and the\n            alleviation of poverty. More particularly, it will support\n            the measures aimed at minimizing the negative social impact\n            of the devaluation in the short term. The Chadian Government\n            has already taken a series of key macroeconomic and\n            structural measures to regain and consolidate\n            competitiveness, and to stabilize its public finances. The\n            Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) is designed to support the\n            implementation of these measures in 1994.
