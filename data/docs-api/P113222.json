The\n            grant will help finance the costs associated with urgent\n            procurement and distribution of fertilizer for irrigated\n            rice production. Irrigated rice is the only crop that can\n            respond effectively to soil fertilization at this period of\n            the cropping season and which can rapidly increase food\n            availability. The support will also benefit the Food Crisis\n            Coordination Unit (CCA) in the Prime Minister's office,\n            which is the permanent secretariat for the national Food\n            Crisis Prevention and Management Framework (FCPMF), and\n            other national bodies involved in the FCPMF, by providing\n            technical assistance to strengthen monitoring of the food\n            security situation and to prepare and implement social\n            safety nets programs. Project preparation and implementation\n            are coordinated with the Joint Government-Donor Food Crisis\n            Committee (CRC) which oversees the CCA. Net sales revenues\n            of fertilizers will be used to strengthen social safety nets programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Additional financing for the\n            Emergency Food Security
