Some lessons learned included: the heads of\n            household program had been a successful crisis response, but\n            it is important for emergency programs to have an explicit\n            exit strategy once the emergency is over. Supported by the\n            Ministry of Labor, a substantial number of municipalities in\n            Argentina decided to establish public employment services.\n            It is important to ensure that the specific interventions\n            for which the Bank is providing assistance are framed within\n            a broader policy dialogue that provides a consistent\n            strategic context. In the absence of flexible delivery\n            systems for adult education, it is difficult to scale-up\n            services and attract students. Process evaluations can be an\n            important monitoring tool.
