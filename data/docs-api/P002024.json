This\n            report presents a project to the International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) for the development of\n            3,800 square kilometers farmed by about 68,000 smallholders\n            in East Sokoto Division of the North Western State of\n            Nigeria. The project follows the pattern of integrated\n            agricultural development which is being currently undertaken\n            by other developing countries in Africa with the aid of Bank\n            Group funds. The project will be a package of\n            infrastructural improvement, project services and supply and\n            credit for farm inputs. Specifically the project will\n            construct 850 km of agricultural crop extraction roads; 65\n            earth dams of about 100,000 m capacity; the development of\n            40 village service centers; the provision of administrative,\n            extension, credit, training, engineering, and market liaison\n            services; seasonal credit for fertilizer, insecticides,\n            seeds and other farm inputs; and medium term credit for ox\n            drawn equipment, cotton sprayers, tractors and ancillary\n            equipment. The project would result in an incremental\n            increase in production for seed cotton 24,000 tons; for\n            maize 70,000 tons; for groundnuts 11,000 tons; and for\n            cowpeas 2,700 tons. Farm incomes are likely to be doubled\n            over the project period. The project will cause an increase\n            of farm family labor employment of about 11,000 man years\n            per annum, resulting in a net return to incremental labor of\n            about N 1.5 per man day (US$2.31) from the 5th year of the\n            project onwards. The estimated internal economic rate of\n            return will lie between 11 and 14 percent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Gusau Agricultural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Gusau Agricultural\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1973/06/1560895/nigeria-gusau-agricultural-development-project","projn":"NG-Agriculture Devt Gus -- P002024","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,National Governance,Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912375172"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative management,Agricultural\n            Development,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,animal\n            health,annual crops,Capital\n            Costs,cattle,Cereals,commodities,Cooperatives,Cotton,Cotton,cotton\n            growing,Cowpea,Cowpeas,Crop,Crop\n            Development,cropping,Cropping Patterns,cultivated\n            land,Dam,districts,Drainage,dry\n            season,employment,Equipment,execution,Extension,Farm,Farm\n            incomes,Farmer,farmer incomes,FARMERS,farming,farms,Federal\n            Government,Fertilizer,Fertilizer Subsidies,fertilizers,Field\n            trials,Fiscal,food\n            grains,foodcrops,Forestry,ginneries,Government\n            agencies,Government agency,Government efforts,Government\n            officials,grasses,grazing,Groundnut,Groundnuts,groundnuts,groundwater,Hybrids,industrial\n            crops,kenaf,Labor Costs,land use,livestock,Local\n            Authorities,Local Authority,Maize,Market\n            Prices,Marketing,millet,Ministries of Agriculture,Natural\n            Resources,okra,pastoralists,planting,political\n            interference,Produce,producers,representatives,Rice,rural\n            population,Seed,Seed Cotton,Seeds,small farmers,Soil\n            Conservation,Soils,Sorghum,State authorities,State\n            Government,streams,Striga,trees,UNDP,United\n            Nations,USAID,vegetation,water shortages,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"administrative management,Agricultural\n            Development,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,animal\n            health,annual crops,Capital\n            Costs,cattle,Cereals,commodities,Cooperatives,Cotton,Cotton,cotton\n            growing,Cowpea,Cowpeas,Crop,Crop\n            Development,cropping,Cropping Patterns,cultivated\n            land,Dam,districts,Drainage,dry\n            season,employment,Equipment,execution,Extension,Farm,Farm\n            incomes,Farmer,farmer incomes,FARMERS,farming,farms,Federal\n            Government,Fertilizer,Fertilizer Subsidies,fertilizers,Field\n            trials,Fiscal,food\n            grains,foodcrops,Forestry,ginneries,Government\n            agencies,Government agency,Government efforts,Government\n            officials,grasses,grazing,Groundnut,Groundnuts,groundnuts,groundwater,Hybrids,industrial\n            crops,kenaf,Labor Costs,land use,livestock,Local\n            Authorities,Local Authority,Maize,Market\n            Prices,Marketing,millet,Ministries of Agriculture,Natural\n            Resources,okra,pastoralists,planting,political\n            interference,Produce,producers,representatives,Rice,rural\n            population,Seed,Seed Cotton,Seeds,small farmers,Soil\n            Conservation,Soils,Sorghum,State authorities,State\n            Government,streams,Striga,trees,UNDP,United\n            Nations,USAID,vegetation,water shortages,Yields"}},"owner":"WB Off: Abuja - Western AFR 2 (AFCW2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"187"},"facets":{}}}
