Overall Borrower performance is rated as\n            highly satisfactory. The project's success was due to\n            the highly motivated commitment of the Hungarian Power\n            Companies, which carried out much of the preparation before\n            requesting Bank financing, to the use of a turnkey\n            procurement contract for the main equipment, and to the\n            absence of policy conditionality apart from standard\n            financial covenants. The Bank was able to support the\n            project under these conditions because of Hungary's\n            demonstrated success in restructuring and privatizing the\n            power sector, and in so doing, was particularly responsive\n            to the client's expressed needs.
