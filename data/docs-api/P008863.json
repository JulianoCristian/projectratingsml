Some lessons learned included: the\n            association's contribution is in project design and\n            sharing the lessons of experience as much as in providing\n            financial resources. Without a closely knit, cohesive core\n            team of national officials with whom association staff can\n            work, support for policy reform will be ineffective. Such a\n            team should have the capacity to see the interrelationships\n            of the components of reform programs and to think in both\n            strategic and operational terms. The design of the ARSP\n            operation was trimmed back during preparation to focus on\n            the central issues of agricultural reform and social\n            protection. Effective implementation of such sectoral\n            reforms requires sector intensive supervision during\n            implementation and detailed sector action plans agreed with\n            the Borrower prior to implementation. In the absence of such\n            conditions, future policy-based operations might better\n            focus on general reforms to the economic environment,\n            supplemented by sector or project operations to achieve\n            sector goals. The focus of the first Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (SAC) on the private sector and banking reform\n            addresses these issues of the economic environment. Strong\n            commitment on the part of the Borrower is essential to the\n            success of structural adjustment operations. The ARSP was\n            effective in developing a policy framework and initiating\n            the reform process, but ineffective in ensuring\n            implementation. Tranche conditionality is an instrument to\n            concentrate minds on getting the work done."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Agriculture Recovery and Social\n            Protection Credit
