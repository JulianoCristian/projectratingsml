The project achieved most of\n            its objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            modest, sustainability is likely, and the performance of\n            both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, organized,\n            long-term communication between ministries and regional\n            offices clearly improves implementation outcome. Second,\n            task manager diligence, knowledge, and implementation\n            orientation can significantly influence project outcomes.\n            Third, insufficient attention may be paid to the\n            instructional consequences of building designs. Projects\n            should study noise and heat levels in school rooms of\n            different types relative to instructional outcomes. Fourth,\n            remote schools are more likely to have cumulative problems,\n            including low-quality construction. More support in time and\n            effort should be made to supervise those sites. Finally,\n            instructional materials, particularly for science, may stay\n            unused until expertise and a real motive for using them\n            exists. In addition to a clear rationale for choosing each\n            item, training must be provided in their use and teacher\n            supervision must include the use of instructional

Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, there is a need for the Government to\n            address the lengthy period required to staff new project\n            implementation units. Second, clearer follow-up procedures\n            to address key policy recommendations of the National\n            Education Commission and studies need to be\n            institutionalized. Third, the membership of tender\n            committees needs to be further standardized by MEHE to\n            reduce the numerous and lengthy reviews and speed up the\n            procurement process. Fourth, joint efforts by GOSL and IDA\n            to standardize the content of progress reports should be\n            continued. Fifth, project performance and sustainability\n            increased when the operational unit responsible for\n            continuation of the activities was given implementation\n            responsibilities. Sixth, future investments in the education\n            sector should be based on clearly defined criteria and\n            measures to assess the impact of these inputs should be\n            developed. Finally, when IDA identifies a task manager\n            appropriately and gives the task manager sufficient\n            authority and resources to address policy and implementation\n            issues, increased consistency occurs and the implementation\n            of a project improves."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - General Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - General Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/731921/sri-lanka-general-education-project","projn":"LK-General Education -- P010343","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970909142316"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absenteeism,ACADEMIC\n            YEAR,Achievements,addition,annual report,basic\n            education,classrooms,community participation,construction\n            industry,cost effectiveness,decentralization,decision\n            making,Development Program,Drawing,Education\n            Facilities,Education Policy,Education Policy\n            Development,education programs,education quality,education\n            reform,education sector,education services,education\n            system,Educational Development,educational\n            materials,Educational\n            Organization,employment,enrollment,infants,interventions,labor\n            market,language teaching,Managers,master\n            teachers,mathematics,mid- term review,mid-term\n            review,Ministries of Education,national education,national\n            education policies,national policies,parents,policy\n            analysis,positive impact,principals,project planning,quality\n            of education,regional education,rural areas,rural\n            schools,school administration,school construction,school\n            facilities,school management,second language,secondary\n            education,secondary schools,small schools,Strengthening\n            school management,teacher,teacher education,teacher\n            training,teachers,technical education,trainees,training\n            courses,Training Programs,vocational training"},"1":{"cdata!":"absenteeism,ACADEMIC\n            YEAR,Achievements,addition,annual report,basic\n            education,classrooms,community participation,construction\n            industry,cost effectiveness,decentralization,decision\n            making,Development Program,Drawing,Education\n            Facilities,Education Policy,Education Policy\n            Development,education programs,education quality,education\n            reform,education sector,education services,education\n            system,Educational Development,educational\n            materials,Educational\n            Organization,employment,enrollment,infants,interventions,labor\n            market,language teaching,Managers,master\n            teachers,mathematics,mid- term review,mid-term\n            review,Ministries of Education,national education,national\n            education policies,national policies,parents,policy\n            analysis,positive impact,principals,project planning,quality\n            of education,regional education,rural areas,rural\n            schools,school administration,school construction,school\n            facilities,school management,second language,secondary\n            education,secondary schools,small schools,Strengthening\n            school management,teacher,teacher education,teacher\n            training,teachers,technical education,trainees,training\n            courses,Training Programs,vocational training"}},"owner":"S.A.
