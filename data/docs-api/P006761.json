The\n            project would provide water through house connections to\n            about 473,000 people in 19 cities by 1983, and sewerage\n            services to 654,000 people in 14 cities by 1983; about half\n            of this population belongs to poorest population earning\n            less than one third of the per capita national income. The\n            project presents higher than usual risks in that it may not\n            be implemented in the intended period, principally because\n            the borrower and the participating water and sewerage\n            companies may not be able to achieve the forecast\n            institutional and financial improvements within a short\n            period of time. It is to be expected that the\n            Government's commitment to strengthening the\n            institutions in the water and sewerage sector together with\n            close
