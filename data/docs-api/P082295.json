  Environmental Sanitation Project; and Global Environment\n            Fund (GEF)-Coastal Cities Project for Vietnam were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            for public sewerage systems, Household (HH) connections are\n            essential components to ensure that most of the organic\n            loading is conveyed to the treatment facility and sufficient\n            flow is maintained for the system to function properly.\n            Connection to the HH was an issue in the past because\n            tertiary lines were not extended close to the HHs, thereby\n            imposing heavy financial burden on HHs if they attempted to\n            connect. All coastal cities in Vietnam had weak soil\n            formation and hence, construction methods are critical to\n            minimize the damages to existing structures located near\n            deep excavation sites. Damages could be reduced if the scope\n            of land acquisition at the start of work is determined\n            taking into account the soil foundation factor. Related to\n            this, as the land management system in Vietnam is still\n            weak, identification of land ownership and land use history\n            should be more accurate to avoid ongoing complaints from the\n            affected people. Vietnam has quite a number of medium-sized\n            cities that are growing fast and looking for an intervention\n            on environmental sanitation. The rational question to raise\n            here would be whether a programmatic approach for this\n            situation will fit better rather than the traditional single\n            investment lending for each city. Urban environmental\n            sanitation intervention is highly contextual and varies\n            widely from city to city (characteristic of waste,\n            differences in urban economy, land, sources of waste, and\n            others). Both approaches have their own pros and cons and\n            opening up wider consultation and debate will help arrive at\n            a more informed and sustainable instrument."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Coastal Cities Environmental\n            Sanitation Project; and Global Environment Fund\n            (GEF)-Coastal Cities

To reduce impacts from waste, collect solid household\n            and commercial wastes, and dredged or excavated material and\n            transport them to approved landfill; contaminated wastes\n            shall be transported separately to an approved site; store\n            no waste on site for more than 24 hours; and avoid\n            discharging water to land or public areas. Landowners will\n            be compensated for any damage, and contractor will not sever\n            or interfere with utility services.
