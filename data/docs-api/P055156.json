Accumulating experience and lessons\n            learned was a main goal of this LIL-financed project.\n            Policy-level lessons learned were that: Microprojects can\n            simultaneously create short-term jobs and improve\n            infrastructure and facilities that are critical to\n            preserving Bulgaria's human resources and expanding\n            private sector employment and growth. Microprojects can\n            contribute to Bulgaria's broader efforts to\n            decentralize the provision of public goods and services to\n            local governments in a way that also helps local governments\n            fight poverty. The RIF Steering Committee composition and\n            its operation raised some questions of bias and political\n            favortism and will need to be more open and transparent. The\n            challenge is to maximize the impact of the RIF's\n            investments by using its leverage to attract other sources\n            of funding. Some lessons learned from RIF management and\n            operations were: Keep bureacracy at a minimum. Microprojects\n            should be aligned with existing Bulgarian legislation and\n            regulations. The Steering Committee would beenfit from\n            greater transparency and input from more diverse partners.\n            Local capacity to conduct social analysis, community\n            organizing, and social impact evaluations will need to be\n            strengthened.
