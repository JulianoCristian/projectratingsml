The lessons learned indicate that when\n            implementing large road rehabilitation programs, especially\n            those with roads passing through densely populated areas, or\n            which have substantial geotechnical and topographical\n            challenges, it is critical that the implementing agency have\n            sufficient in-house capacity to prepare, design and\n            supervise works. For complex road rehabilitation programs,\n            greater emphasis should be placed on assessing the\n            conditions at individual project sites, rather than trying\n            to finalize detailed designs. The delivery of diagnostic\n            mechanisms and tools to strengthen a road\n            administration's capacity to evaluate road programs\n            should be developed in the early stages of project\n            implementation for their potential demonstration effect.\n            Bank funding for ambitious and far-reaching reforms is most\n            effective when undertaken to support and deepen on going\n            restructuring schemes that are Government-initiated. When\n            resorting to special units to manage projects, they should\n            always to located within the agency/entity that will\n            ultimately be responsible for sustaining the project after\n            the closing date. Operations developed in post-conflict\n            situations should be open to corrections amid emerging\n            realities on the ground. Project teams should also be aware\n            that re-establishing a credible procurement process in\n            post-conflict environments is a necessary and critical\n            first-step for most governments, and that it may take\n            considerable time before a local system is harmonized and functional."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lebanon - National Roads Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lebanon - National Roads Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5652897/lebanon-national-roads-project","projn":"LB-National Roads -- P038674","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Information Technology","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Lebanon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050310091518"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Account, accounting, Accounts, acquisition,\n            asphalt, auditing, axle load, bitumen, bridges, budgeting,\n            civil service, communities, contractors, cost overruns, cost\n            sharing, expenditure, expenditures, financial audits,\n            framework, fuel, hazards, highways, information technology,\n            Infrastructure services, institutional capacity, Internal\n            Rate of Return, intervention, laws, learning process,\n            Lessons Learned, maintenance costs, NATIONAL ROADS, Net\n            Present Value, North Africa, overlay, pavement, pavement\n            strength, periodic maintenance, private sector, procurement,\n            programming, Project Implementation, project preparation,\n            Public expenditure, quality control, quality of work, road\n            conditions, road construction, road financing, Road Funds,\n            road improvements, road infrastructure, road maintenance,\n            road management, road networks, Road Rehabilitation, Road\n            User Charges, roughness, safety, secondary roads, sharing,\n            social development, social issues, sustainable development,\n            terrain, topography, traffic, traffic counting, traffic\n            counts, transparency, Transport, transportation, trouble\n            shooting, vehicle license fees, Vehicle Operating Costs,\n            vehicles, weight"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF029352-PHRD-NATIONAL ROADS PROJ.I (RECIPIENT-EXEC.),TF029541-PHRD-NATIONAL ROADS PROJ.
