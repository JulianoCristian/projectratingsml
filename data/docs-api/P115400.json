To\n            support longer-term policy reforms it is worthwhile to have\n            a multi-year program design that allows some flexibility in\n            the program. A DPL program series instead of a single DPL\n            provides an opportunity for continued policy dialogue and\n            support reforms over longer time. A DPL that is focused on a\n            small number of related sectors, such as Human Development,\n            provides a comprehensive and cohesive approach for the Bank\n            to support a Government's reform agenda. A limited\n            sector DPL is also easier to manage for the Bank than a DPL\n            with many sectors. Such a cohesive approach intensifies the\n            policy dialogue in a sector which could lead to better\n            quality benchmarks and coherent reforms. Despite the higher\n            cost related to it, the upfront investment in analytical\n            work and policy notes in the preparation phase can help to\n            set the reform framework and embed a DPL program in a\n            country's national strategy. Investment lending\n            projects can further supported these analytical works.\n            Strong management support from the Bank at the beginning of\n            an operation with Senior Management participating in the\n            DPL1 preparation phase can help to get the buy-in from the\n            Government and country unit for a DPL program.\n            Decentralization of head quarter staff to the field ensures\n            a close and continued dialogue with the Government and other\n            partners throughout the program series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -

The DPL series support the adoption and\n            implementation of structural reform policies to: (i)\n            increase employment and lay the foundations for long-term\n            productivity growth by providing incentives for job creation\n            and labor force participation as well as by improving\n            quality of education; and (ii) promote fiscal sustainability\n            through efficiency gains in the social sectors.\n            Bulgaria's economic growth is forecast to decline\n            substantially in 2009 and 2010 compared to 2008, and the\n            Government is focusing on a dual strategy of: (i)\n            maintaining a prudent fiscal stance to ensure the continued\n            cushion of a sizable fiscal surplus; and (ii) continued\n            structural reforms to increase competitiveness and raise\n            productivity so as to emerge stronger from the economic\n            downturn. The SIR DPL 3 contributes to address both\n            short-term and medium-term aspects of the expected economic\n            slowdown by supporting: (i) short-term measures to address\n            the potential adverse employment effect from the economic\n            downturn; (ii) the government's continued reforms to\n            improve, in the short- and medium-term, the efficiency of\n            resource use in health and education; and (iii) measures to\n            raise employment and productivity growth over the\n            medium-term through structural reforms to improve employment\n            activation policies, raise quality of primary and secondary\n            education and to reduce the regulatory burden for the\n            enterprise
