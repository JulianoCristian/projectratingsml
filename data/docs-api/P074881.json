The 2009 and 2012 restructuring of the\n            project gave a momentum to the project to get back on track.\n            Specifically, the 2012 restructuring of the project allowed\n            more time and focus on the General Ledger (GL)\n            implementation issues, and reinforced stakeholders'\n            ownership.
