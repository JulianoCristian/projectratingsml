The lessons learned indicate\n            that community cost participation is very important,\n            especially in countries where the Government cannot provide\n            the population with proper social services. More details on\n            the costs of the proposed activities have to be included in\n            the project planning in order to ensure that the financial\n            resources allocated correspond to the targeted results.\n            Where the Bank decides to support country programs, it is\n            important to (i) validate the analytical work supporting the\n            national program and (ii) ensure that the national\n            capacities to implement it are potentially available. In a\n            LICUS country, Vocational Training is problematic. Setting\n            up a demand-driven vocational training system in an\n            unstructured economy is not easy and requires prior\n            appropriate knowledge and an analysis of the market labor\n            force and the private sector. Addressing quality issues\n            requires prior national consensus on standards in curricula\n            and the evaluation system. In a changing institutional\n            context with weak national capacity, it is advisable that\n            the Project Management Unit (PMU) have capacity to support\n            the Ministry in project monitoring and evaluation. By\n            decentralizing project management/implementation, the\n            project avoided interference with its implementation. Where\n            project management/implementation is decentralized and the\n            national capacity is low, close attention should be paid to\n            the coordination and communication between the PMU and its\n            decentralized units. Particularly, comprehensive procedures\n            and responsibilities on reporting should be set up from the beginning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Third Education

program for the Reinforcement of\n            Education and Training, namely primary education and\n            vocational training.  To ensure effective and timely\n            implementation of the project, it will also support local\n            capacity building in the planning, execution, monitoring and\n            evaluation of sector management.  The project will improve\n            learning at primary level through increased participation in\n            quality education.  Participation will be improved through:\n            (a) establishment of local school committees with financial\n            and managerial authority on public primary schools; (b)\n            provision of adequate infrastructure.  Quality of the\n            teaching-learning processes will be improved through: (a)\n            development of better management practices to monitor\n            delivery of the study program; (b) provision of\n            teaching/learning materials, both for class and individual\n            learning activities; (c) changes in the teaching/learning\n            methods used by teachers in the classroom; (d) changes in\n            the supervision practices to develop and monitor\n            implementation of effective teaching practices; and (e)\n            support to development of learning assessment and education\n            information systems at regional and central levels of the\n            Ministry of Education (MOE).  The project will also improve\n            competencies of skilled workers through the establishment of\n            an autonomous, flexible and effective demand-driven training\n            system in which training institutions and employers will get\n            grants from the Government.  The establishment of a\n            performing vocational training system will be achieved\n            through the creation of a small, autonomous institution: the\n            Office of Vocational Training (OVT).  Competencies and\n            skills will be developed through: (a) support for management\n            and the initial financing of a Vocational Training Fund\n            (VTF); (b) support for the development of training modules;\n            and (c) support for the reorganization of existing\n            vocational  training institutions.  Finally, the project\n            will support the development of effective project management\n            capacities among staff in the Project Management Unit (PMU)\n            and improve competencies of MOE authorities in planning,\n            execution, monitoring and evaluation of the sector program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Third Education
