The project consists of: (a) the\n            addition of a 213 MW hydroelectric generating plant,\n            Guadalupe IV; (b) the construction of 150 km of transmission\n            lines; (c) the expansion of 5-6 existing substations; (d)\n            the construction of 4-5 new ones; and (e) the rehabilitation\n            and expansion of EPM's electricity distribution\n            network; the project also includes construction of a\n            regional energy control center which would enable EPM to\n            participate in the least-cost operation of the national\n            power system. Finally, through a training program for highly\n            specialized staff, EPM's technical capability would be\n            strengthened. Tariff measures provided for under the project\n            would support the Government's objective of sound\n            sector financing and economic structure of tariffs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Fourth Guadalupe Hydro Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Fourth Guadalupe Hydro\n            Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/05/726304/colombia-fourth-guadalupe-hydro-power-project","projn":"CO-Medellin Power Schem -- P006768","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Economic Theory & Research,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912494511"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"alternative energy,Bank Lending,Bank\n            loans,coal,coal,coal reserves,coke,commercial\n            energy,consumers,continuous monitoring,crude\n            oil,Debt,development strategy,distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,domestic energy,domestic\n            energy supply,domestic use,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            expansion,economic growth,economic value,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,Electricity generation,electricity\n            supply,electricity use,energy consumption,energy\n            prices,Energy Resources,energy sources,energy supply,energy\n            use,Engineering,Engineering Studies,Environmental\n            Aspects,exchange rate,exports,falling,final energy\n            consumption,financial resources,financial\n            transfers,Fire,Forecasts,fuel,gas,gas,GDP,GNP,growth\n            rate,Heat,Hydro Power,hydro\n            resources,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,labor force,"},"1":{"cdata!":"alternative energy,Bank Lending,Bank\n            loans,coal,coal,coal reserves,coke,commercial\n            energy,consumers,continuous monitoring,crude\n            oil,Debt,development strategy,distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,domestic energy,domestic\n            energy supply,domestic use,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic\n            expansion,economic growth,economic value,Electric\n            Power,Electricity,Electricity generation,electricity\n            supply,electricity use,energy consumption,energy\n            prices,Energy Resources,energy sources,energy supply,energy\n            use,Engineering,Engineering Studies,Environmental\n            Aspects,exchange rate,exports,falling,final energy\n            consumption,financial resources,financial\n            transfers,Fire,Forecasts,fuel,gas,gas,GDP,GNP,growth\n            rate,Heat,Hydro Power,hydro\n            resources,imports,Income,inflation,Insurance,labor force,"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"2938"},"facets":{}}}
