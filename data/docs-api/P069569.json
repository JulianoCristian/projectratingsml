The implementation of the\n            project points to several lessons, with implications for the\n            design of subsequent adjustment operations for Niger. First,\n            Government ownership of the reform program supported by the\n            project was critical. Second, although commitment was\n            necessary, it proved insufficient for full implementation of\n            the reform program in the presence of limited capacity.\n            Indeed, limited technical and managerial capacity\n            constrained program implementation. Thus, capacity must be\n            built to design and implement policies and programs in\n            Niger. While this is being done, a pragmatic approach should\n            consist of tailoring reforms to the country's\n            institutional and technical capacity. Third, the\n            project's design as a two-tranche operation and its\n            timeframe facilitated the implementation of critical\n            elements of the reform program, including privatization and\n            procurement reform which require a longer implementation\n            time and follow-up actions. Fourth, adjustment operations\n            can be an effective tool to advance specific policy reforms\n            in the social sectors.  Fifth, the lack of an efficient\n            monitoring and evaluation system was a major weakness for\n            the implementation of structural and social policy reforms\n            under this project Sixth, the burden of adjustment\n            operations in Niger must hinge on both expenditure\n            management and revenue mobilization. Increasing the level of\n            mobilization of domestic revenue through revenue-enhancing\n            measures would complement expenditure reforms. It would also\n            alleviate Niger's extreme dependence on unpredictable\n            external aid. Seventh, the project has helped strengthen the\n            prerequisites to programmatic lending by improving public\n            finance management, transparency in budget execution and\n            reporting. However, a key lesson that comes out is that much\n            remains to be done to prepare Niger for programmatic\n            lending. As noted in the current CAS, progress is needed in\n            three critical areas before Niger is ready for consolidated\n            programmatic lending: (i) gradual introduction of program\n            budgeting on the basis of comprehensive sector strategies;\n            (ii) a consolidation of fiduciary and budget management\n            reforms; and (iii) intensified efforts to build\n            institutional and individual capacity. Lessons drawn from\n            this project's implementation have influenced the\n            design of a subsequent public expenditure adjustment\n            operation (PEAC II) both in its conceptual framework and its\n            operational modalities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Public Expenditure Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Public
