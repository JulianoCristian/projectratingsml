The development objectives of the project\n            were to enhance the international competitiveness of\n            Hungarian agro processed exports and increase the efficiency\n            of production and effectiveness of marketing of agro\n            processed products by: (a) increasing earnings of agro\n            processed and forestry exports, particularly to the\n            convertible currency markets, by improving the quality and\n            marketing of exports; (b) improving the efficiency of\n            operations of enterprises in the agro processing subsector\n            by reducing their unit costs of operations and improving\n            their productivity; and (c) creating a more effective\n            business climate in the agro processing subsector in line\n            with macroeconomic price and tax reform. Bank performance\n            was satisfactory. The Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory. The main lessons from the project were as\n            follows: (i) successful restructuring of medium to large\n            state-owned enterprises cannot be accomplished without\n            sweeping reforms that address questions of enterprise\n            ownership and governance, and sustained exposure to domestic\n            and foreign competition; ii) the dangers of too restrictive\n            a specification in terms of targeting of credit, and the\n            need to ensure movement towards more general, open lines of\n            credit that are available to a broad spectrum of users;\n            (iii) the need for close follow-up and frequent assessment\n            of the situation in regard to project implementation, and\n            for flexibility to adapt the project's provisions and\n            procedures to changing circumstances; and (iv) the\n            importance of careful design of the Bank's sub loan\n            application, evaluation and reporting requirements, taking\n            account of the additional burden that this imposes on\n            private sector participants, both participating banks and\n            investors, operating in a competitive environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Agroprocessing Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Hungary - Agroprocessing\n            Modernization
