Sustainability is\n            rated as unlikely through lack of ongoing maintenance and\n            means to fund it. Bank performance  rated satisfactory\n            mainly for the good quality at entry of this project.\n            Borrower  performance is also rated satisfactory, despite\n            sometimes lethargic management of procurement. For not\n            achieving its major objectives but still producing a few\n            worthwhile results,  the overall outcome of the Colombo\n            Urban Transport Project   is rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Sustainability is rated as unlikely.  Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; poor quality at entry with a\n            design committed to reforms-a legacy of a larger, abandoned\n            project-not supported by the borrower and lacking\n            instruments to achieve them.  Borrower performance is also\n            rated unsatisfactory; procurement was protracted, sometimes\n            featuring ad hoc acquisitions. The overall outcome of the\n            Colombo Environmental Improvement Project  is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Sustainability is rated as unlikely; Bank\n            performance is rated  unsatisfactory; poor quality came from\n            a rigid project design that failed to effectively involve\n            either borrower or beneficiaries. Borrower performance is\n            also rated unsatisfactory, principally because of the\n            failure to implement solutions for solid waste and\n            wastewater pollution. Overall outcome of the Year 2000\n            Emergency Assistance Project is rated moderately\n            satisfactory, as the project apparently achieved its\n            intended objective, but with significant shortcomings; an\n            unclear counterfactual and public agencies receiving project\n            support after January 1,2000, and yet suffering no Y2K\n            disruption. Sustainability is likely, since Sri\n            Lanka's economy and banking sectors have already\n            demonstrated their resilience to a Y2K-type event. For its\n            rapid project preparation and close supervision, Bank\n            performance is rated satisfactory. For borrower\n            performance, the rating is also satisfactory, given strong\n            project ownership and efficient  implementation by the\n            Government authorities concerned. Experience with these\n            projects confirms the following OED lessons:  1)  Project\n            performance is vulnerable to the impact of conflict,\n            especially through unexpected  conflict events during\n            project implementation. Spatially separating a project from\n            active  conflict zones does not mean that an operation will\n            be free of conflict constraints.  2) Project design should\n            not be blind to conflict, and must cautiously but explicitly\n            address the  constraints imposed. War-weary governments are\n            unlikely to have strong ownership of  reform that is\n            unrelated to the causes of the conflict.  3)  It is\n            important to focus upon a clear vision of the intended\n            development results of a project and to remain focused on\n            them through systematic monitoring and evaluation. In other\n            words, the baseline should be measured, the counterfactual\n            clearly understood, and monitoring and evaluation supported\n            and implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

Some lessons drawn from the project\n            include: 1) The Y2K project shows that projects with focused\n            objectives and a clear scope have a better chance of\n            success. 2) The project was demand-driven and therefore\n            there was a firm commitment at the highest level in the\n            country. This shows that for successful project\n            implementation, leadership, management, and commitment are\n            the keys to success. 3) Part of success can be attributed to\n            good project preparation and project management. 4) Putting\n            the implementing agencies in the drivers seat and giving\n            them full responsibility for project implementation and\n            monitoring added to the project success and proved to be\n            beneficial in achieving the project objectives in a timely\n            manner. 5) Other elements of the project which contributed\n            to successful project implementation were rapid recognition\n            of the skill gaps and timely training programs/workshops and\n            independent testing, development of contingency plans,\n            effective project execution, widespread cooperation and team\n            work, effective communication, and involvement and\n            commitment at all levels. 6) In crisis or emergency\n            situations, there is an opportunity to accomplish what would\n            seem impossible under normal conditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
