Even issues that are\n            seemingly resolved can re-emerge unexpectedly. For example,\n            there are current political controversies swirling around\n            the National AIDS Commission, with continuing rumors that it\n            is about to be dissolved. Given that the Commission's\n            initial creation was viewed by many as simply a quick\n            political fix, intended to placate public outcry over\n            increasing number of AIDS-related illnesses and deaths, it\n            is not surprising that it remains a source of controversy,\n            in many cases merely a tool in ongoing power struggles. In\n            the case of the HSRP, the lack of a macroeconomic support\n            program to push for difficult policy issues outside the\n            purview of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW)\n            probably constrained or delayed actions, particularly in the\n            areas of decentralization of services and upgrading the\n            salaries and benefits of health workers. Sustainable human\n            resources retention requires long-term planning, ownership,\n            and most of all, innovation. Like many countries in the\n            region, shortage of skilled manpower is one of the main\n            challenges facing the Government of Lesotho. Levels of\n            remuneration, while important, are not the primary issue.\n            HIV/AIDS programs must be balanced with attention to, and\n            integration with, other key health priorities. There is\n            near-universal agreement that HIV has crowded out other\n            important health challenges in Lesotho. The HCTA's\n            focus on Global Fund resources may have exacerbated this\n            problem, with its exclusive concentration not only on HIV,\n            but on global fund-financed HIV interventions; Government\n            attention, largely because of the significant dollar amounts\n            involved, remains with the global fund grant, and\n            opportunities to integrate both global fund activities and\n            HIV-related activities with the health sector in general\n            have been missed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Health Sector Reform

Some lessons learned included: the successful\n            strengthening of capacity in the project accounting and\n            procurement units underscores the value of building on and\n            use of existing systems. Strengthening procurement and\n            financial management capacity had a positive impact and\n            helped to accelerate project implementation. Moreover, it is\n            commendable that the project worked with other health Sector\n            Wide Approach (SWAp) partners to use common fiduciary\n            systems. The World Bank has tremendous influence and\n            leverage in a country like Lesotho that is highly reliant on\n            its support for sustainable development. The World Bank has\n            greatly assisted the private sector in Lesotho by working\n            for regulatory changes and other adjustments to create a\n            more enabling environment for business development and\n            growth. In contrast, the civil society sector appears\n            neglected and its potential to contribute to economic growth\n            in Lesotho is unacknowledged. This is a particularly large\n            gap when one considers the amount of donor funds flowing to\n            Lesotho to support the response to HIV and AIDS and the\n            growing proportion of these funds that is now supporting\n            local, non-governmental organizations and other civil\n            society entities. These funds create employment\n            opportunities and alternative futures for Lesotho's\n            young people. Creating a more enabling environment for civil\n            society growth and development, by, for exampling, reviewing\n            and revising laws and policies governing such entities,\n            would significantly improve the ability of the sector to\n            provide effective responses to Lesotho's development\n            challenges and to provide meaningful employment and\n            professional development opportunities for Lesotho's\n            future generations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - HIV and AIDS Capacity Building and\n            Technical Assistance

Long term TA will be contracted to\n            coordinate and ensure timely submissions, and approval of\n            annual work programs, facilitate disbursement of funds,\n            ensure adequacy of financial controls and audits, and ensure\n            timely reporting on agreed monitoring and evaluation\n            indicators. Support to the Ministry of Health and Social\n            Welfare (MOHSW) is the second component, and involves two\n            sub-components: TA to establish the new HIV/AIDS\n            Directorate, provision of equipment and training to the\n            Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, and, TA to the Procurement\n            Unit; and, medium term TA to enable the National Drugs and\n            Supplies Organization (NDSO) conduct procurement, using\n            international competitive bidding. The third component will\n            finance Consultants to manage proposals submitted for\n            funding, strengthen the District AIDS Coordinators and Task\n            Forces, through training activities, and implement\n            monitoring and evaluation activities. Finally, the fourth\n            component will support capacity building to enable civil\n            society and other organizations develop proposals, implement\n            and fulfill the reporting requirements for disbursements\n            under the grants agreement.
