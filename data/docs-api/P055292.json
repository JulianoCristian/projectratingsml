Some lessons learned includes: financial\n            sector reforms are relatively easy to design but difficult\n            to implement. Successful implementation depends on two\n            crucial factors: the commitment of the authorities to the\n            reform program; and the effectiveness of project\n            supervision. The Egyptian authorities have shown a strong\n            commitment to the multi-year reform program that was\n            designed by the reformist government that was appointed in\n            2004. The reform program did not include the privatization\n            of the two largest commercial banks nor the large insurance\n            companies. However, many measures were taken to improve the\n            management of these institutions, which one commentator\n            resembled to an effective 'privatization of\n            management' rather than 'privatization of\n            ownership'. A dogmatic approach to the ownership\n            question would not be justified, especially after the public\n            rescue of so many leading private banks and insurance\n            companies in high-income countries during the 2008 global\n            financial crisis. Policy based operations may require strong\n            Bank technical assistance efforts as part of the process,\n            particularly in the financial sector. Multi-trenched\n            financial sector adjustment operations are effective\n            instruments to support major financial sector reforms.\n            Achievements under the operations three policy areas thus\n            contributed substantially to the overall development outcome\n            sought by the operation: strengthen the enabling legal and\n            institutional environment for financial intermediation and\n            risk management and to increase the role and participation\n            of the private sector in the provision of financial\n            services. The most relevant lesson of this project is\n            perhaps the importance of the ownership of the reform\n            program by the authorities and their strong commitment to\n            its success. This is underscored by the second component of\n            the operation concerning the restructuring of the ailing\n            specialized public financial institutions. The key lesson\n            from these two projects was the importance of the commitment\n            of the authorities to the reform program, which was most\n            evident prior to and during the project. Without this strong\n            and effective commitment, such significant results could not\n            have been achieved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt, Morocco and Guatemala - First and\n

A number of useful lessons can be learned from\n            Pakistan's experience with bank restructuring and\n            privatization including the following: 1. NCB reforms could\n            not be carried out without strong government's support\n            and commitment. 2. Public sector banks must undergo cost\n            restructuring before privatization to bring their\n            cost/income ratios in line with private banks.  3. In order\n            to secure a good price for a bank sale, the bank must be\n            recapitalized so that it is able to meet the minimum capital\n            adequacy requirement.  4. Downsizing requires bank\n            management to identify excess manpower in the labor force.\n            5. A formulaic instead of subjective approach should be used\n            to minimize contention, send signals to stakeholders (staff,\n            unions, government officials and politicians) about the\n            intent to change the culture, and ease the legal process. 6.\n            The stock of NPLs must be dealt with through major\n            amendments to loan recovery laws and implementation of\n            government-induced recovery drives.  7. The government must\n            bring in professional management teams from outside to\n            restructure and turn around the failed banks.  8. For\n            privatization to succeed, the government should avoid\n            unrealistic timelines, conduct the sale transparently, lay\n            out clear road maps, launch targeted road shows, and\n            establish a track record to widen investor interest. 9.\n            Restructuring of failed banks is costly but is necessary.\n            The high costs reflect the cumulative costs of\n            mis-governance and poor management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

The voluntary scheme\n            will be complemented by the out-sourcing of non-core staff,\n            and leave without pay, but without benefits for those in\n            executive levels; 2) a proportional reduction of bank\n            branches, will accompany staff rationalization to assure a\n            structural, and virtually irreversible reform, namely in the\n            Habib Bank Limited (HBL), United Bank Limited (UBL), and\n            National Bank of Pakistan (NBP). The cost of this component\n            would come mainly from the settlement of long-term leases on\n            rented space, and, NCB funds will finance this cost as part\n            of counterpart funding; 3) the amalgamation of the National\n            Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) into a National Bank\n            will entail severance payment costs, and the costs emanating\n            from recognition of quasi fiscal costs, embedded in\n            NDFC's balance sheet; 4) completion of the Muslim\n            Commercial Bank, and Allied Banking Limited privatizations,\n            through government divestments for the first, and, taking\n            into account the level of insolvency of the second, these\n            costs will be financed by the Government, implied in the\n            price of remaining shareholding; and, 5) other policy\n            measures, such as liberalization of bank branching policy;\n            revision of tax policy and administration; amendment of the\n            Loan Recovery Act (1997); reform of the National Savings\n            Scheme; and discontinuance of the new Foreign Currency\n
