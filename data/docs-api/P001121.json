Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, there is a need for\n            realistic projections of project timetables, loan\n            disbursements, and public utility revenues. Second, rather\n            than relying on debt financing, it is important to generate\n            adequate internal cash, particularly in currencies subject\n            to possible appreciation.
