Institutional development\n            impact is rated as negligible given the remaining financial\n            problems and poor operating and monitoring capacity of the\n            executing agency (the Electric Power Corporation, EPC). The\n            performance of the Borrower (the Government) was\n            satisfactory while that of the EPC was less than\n            satisfactory. Continuing institutional weaknesses at EPC,\n            including prolonged vacancies in its key engineering and\n            financial positions, resulted in weak administration of EPC\n            and the project. The performance of the Bank was generally\n            satisfactory. Some of the cost and time overrun difficulties\n            may have been avoided if the Bank had proceeded to Project\n            approval with a detailed Project design in hand. However,\n            the Bank took noteworthy steps to reassess, revise, and\n            expedite reappraisal. The lessons learned are as follows. By\n            ceding project administration to the Asian Development Bank\n            (ADB) and not participating in supervising missions, IDA was\n            not in a position to exercise quality control. IDA was not\n            intimately involved in the procurement exercise for the\n            civil works, nor involved in the change in the project\n            design, which brought about large increases in costs\n            compared to the appraisal estimates. At the time of\n            appraisal the project design depended on the results of a\n            feasibility report. Some of the costs and time over-run\n            probably could have been avoided if the financiers had\n            proceeded to project approval on the basis of a detailed\n            project design, or better still, waited for the results of\n            the civil works procurement procedure to be known."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Western Samoa - The Afulilo Hydroelectric Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Western Samoa - The Afulilo\n            Hydroelectric Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/12/734979/western-samoa-afulilo-hydroelectric-project","projn":"WS -- P0wer (Adb) -- P004857","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Business in Development,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Business Environment","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Samoa","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019191930"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,acquisition,actual\n            cost,ADB,audited accounts,auditing,billing,Borrower,capital\n            expenditures,Commercial operations,contractors,cost\n            estimates,cost\n            recovery,debt,disbursement,Disbursements,EIB,electricity\n            generation,emissions,employment,environmental\n            issues,exploitation,financial management,Financial\n            performance,financial reports,financing gap,financing\n            plans,FISCAL YEAR,fish,foreign exchange,fuels,housing,IDA\n            credit,IDA credits,impact assessment,Institutional\n            development,insurance,inventory,Land use,loan,Loan\n            Agreement,Loan Agreements,loan amount,loan\n            disbursements,oil,operating costs,operating efficiency,power\n            plants,procurement,quality control,reporting,retroactive\n            financing,Special Funds,supplementary\n            financing,suppliers,technical assistance,unaudited financial statements,watershed"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,accounts,acquisition,actual\n            cost,ADB,audited accounts,auditing,billing,Borrower,capital\n            expenditures,Commercial operations,contractors,cost\n            estimates,cost\n            recovery,debt,disbursement,Disbursements,EIB,electricity\n            generation,emissions,employment,environmental\n            issues,exploitation,financial management,Financial\n            performance,financial reports,financing gap,financing\n            plans,FISCAL YEAR,fish,foreign exchange,fuels,housing,IDA\n            credit,IDA credits,impact assessment,Institutional\n            development,insurance,inventory,Land use,loan,Loan\n            Agreement,Loan Agreements,loan amount,loan\n            disbursements,oil,operating costs,operating efficiency,power\n            plants,procurement,quality control,reporting,retroactive\n            financing,Special Funds,supplementary\n            financing,suppliers,technical assistance,unaudited financial statements,watershed"}},"owner":"World Bank Office: Sydney (EACNF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"repnb":"15247"},"733123":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1993/04/733123/western-samoa-afulilo-hydroelectric-project-supplemental-credit","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1993/04/733123/western-samoa-afulilo-hydroelectric-project-supplemental-credit","new_url":"1993/04/733123/western-samoa-afulilo-hydroelectric-project-supplemental-credit","disclosure_date":"2012-07-10T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-07-10T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-07-10T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/04/01/000009265_3961004075024/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1993/04/01/000009265_3961004075024/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1781","datestored":"1993-04-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1993-04-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Western Samoa - Afulilo Hydroelectric\n            Project (supplemental Credit)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Afulilo Hydroelectric Project\n            supports the Government's energy policy of developing\n            indigenous renewable energy resources for generating\n            electricity to replace high cost diesel fuel. The project\n            consists of the following components: 1) civil works which\n            include a composite gravity concrete and rockfilled dam, an\n            intake structure, a pipeline, a surge chamber, a tailrace, a\n            powerhouse, and a switchyard.  Further to this, the project\n            entails 2) the installation of electrical and mechanical\n            equipment which includes a 4 MW turbine generator, auxiliary\n            equipment, a set up transformer, and switchgear; 3) the\n            construction of 23 km of 22 kV tranmission line, and\n            upgrading of a 28 km section of a transmission line from 22\n            kV to 33 kV.  Finally, the project involves 4) provisions\n            for consulting services for detailed engineering and\n            construction supervision. The project's overall\n            objectives are to support the energy policy Government of\n            Western Samoa of developing indigenous renewable energy\n            resources for generating electricity at an economic cost to\n            displace h electricity generated by burning imported diesel\n            at Upolu's diesel pow station which consumes expensive\n            imported spare parts and consumables. output of the project\n            will supplement electricity generated by run-of-the-river\n            hydrostations during the dry season, when output from is\n            reduced due to low stream flows, requiring diesel generation\n            to mee electricity demand.  The project, which is currently\n            under constructio about 65% complete, is located in the\n            Upper Salani Basin some 26 km so of Apia.  Afulilo will be\n            the first hydroelectric development in Upolu provide\n            over-season storage and will substantially increase hydro\n            ener firm capacity during the dry season.  The project\n            involves constructio 20 meter high dam, together with a\n            tunnel headrace and penstock to con water to a power station\n            with two 2 MW turbine generators located at F Bay on the\n            northeast coast of Upolu.  The output from Afulilo will be\n            transmitted to Apia via an existing feeder which is being\n            upgraded fro to 33 kV as part of the project.  It is\n            estimated that the Afulilo pro will add approximately 24\n            GWh/year of average energy potential to the system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Western Samoa - Afulilo Hydroelectric\n            Project (supplemental Credit)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Western Samoa -

The output from Afulilo will be\n            transmitted to Apia via an existing feeder which is being\n            upgraded fro to 33 kV as part of the project.  It is\n            estimated that the Afulilo pro will add approximately 24\n            GWh/year of average energy potential to the system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Western Samoa - Afulilo Hydroelectric Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Western Samoa - Afulilo\n            Hydroelectric Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/11/740475/western-samoa-afulilo-hydroelectric-project","projn":"WS -- P0wer (Adb) -- P004857","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Climate Change and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Samoa","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926070636"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"afforestation,biomass,commercial\n            enterprises,conservation,conservation of\n            energy,construction,Consultancy Services,covers,demand for\n            electricity,demand for petroleum,demand for petroleum\n            products,demand forecast,diesel fuel,distribution losses,dry\n            season,elasticity,elasticity of demand,Electric\n            Power,Electrical energy,electricity,electricity\n            demand,electricity generation,electricity\n            production,electricity sales,electricity sector,electricity\n            supply,energy balance,Energy Committee,Energy data,energy\n            demand,Energy generation,energy output,energy\n            planning,Energy Policy,energy resource,energy\n            resources,Energy Sector,energy shortages,energy\n            supply,energy use,engineering,engineering\n            design,engines,Environmental Aspects,exclusive use,final\n            energy consumption,forest\n            cover,Forestry,fuels,gas,generation\n            capacity,generator,growth in demand,income,lighting,oil,Oil\n            Equivalent,oil price,peak demand,petroleum,petroleum\n            consumption,pipeline,Pipes,policy formulation,power\n            generation,Power Stations,power supplies,power supply,power\n            supply system,Power System,PRESSURE,Programs,Public\n            Works,renewable energy,renewable energy\n            sources,reservoirs,Solar energy,steam\n            turbine,streamflow,structures,technicians,transport,waste,water heating"},"1":{"cdata!":"afforestation,biomass,commercial\n            enterprises,conservation,conservation of\n            energy,construction,Consultancy Services,covers,demand for\n            electricity,demand for petroleum,demand for petroleum\n            products,demand forecast,diesel fuel,distribution losses,dry\n            season,elasticity,elasticity of demand,Electric\n            Power,Electrical energy,electricity,electricity\n            demand,electricity generation,electricity\n            production,electricity sales,electricity sector,electricity\n            supply,energy balance,Energy Committee,Energy data,energy\n            demand,Energy generation,energy output,energy\n            planning,Energy Policy,energy resource,energy\n            resources,Energy Sector,energy shortages,energy\n            supply,energy use,engineering,engineering\n            design,engines,Environmental Aspects,exclusive use,final\n            energy consumption,forest\n            cover,Forestry,fuels,gas,generation\n            capacity,generator,growth in demand,income,lighting,oil,Oil\n            Equivalent,oil price,peak demand,petroleum,petroleum\n            consumption,pipeline,Pipes,policy formulation,power\n            generation,Power Stations,power supplies,power supply,power\n            supply system,Power System,PRESSURE,Programs,Public\n            Works,renewable energy,renewable energy\n            sources,reservoirs,Solar energy,steam\n            turbine,streamflow,structures,technicians,transport,waste,water heating"}},"owner":"World Bank Office: Sydney (EACNF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"repnb":"6723"},"facets":{}}}
