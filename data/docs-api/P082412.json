Some lessons learned\n            included: lack of a holistic approach may result in\n            emphasizing one concern over another, for example, focusing\n            mainly on environmental and economic considerations may lead\n            to a design with unnecessarily fewer and larger buses.\n            However, fewer and larger buses reduce comfort and increase\n            waiting times. Such a decrease in service quality is a\n            disincentive for public transport use and will, at least in\n            the long run, go against environmental and economic\n            considerations. Hence, it is important that a design that\n            includes user participation finds the right balance between\n            environmental and economic considerations and service\n            quality. Travel and network models are excellent tools to\n            evaluate network designs, but over reliance on normative\n            analytical tools that 'optimize' a network subject\n            to a set of assumptions, especially in areas that assume\n            behavioral changes, should be avoided. The modeling exercise\n            also needs to include 'bottom up' inputs, such as\n            information on the importance in terms of overall weight\n            people give to transfers, waiting, and walking. The Santiago\n            experience showed that it is not advisable to redesign the\n            public transport network without considering the existing\n            information on travel demand and destination available\n            through the operators. Additionally, stakeholders'\n            involvement in the network design process, especially the\n            municipalities comprising the metropolitan area, operators\n            and users, is essential, and the design concept for the\n            network needs to be extensively modeled before implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Santiago Urban Transport\n            Programmatic

competitive, world city, and improve its quality of\n            life, by upgrading the level of transport services for\n            residents (particularly low income residents), and\n            businesses, reduce resource costs, and increase\n            environmental quality. The specific objectives are to: a)\n            Reduce transport costs in their financial, travel time, and\n            environmental dimensions, and increase transport efficiency;\n            b) Improve the coordination of public sector activities in\n            land use, transport planning, infrastructure investment,\n            traffic management, and bus franchising; c) Address urban\n            poverty by improving access to jobs, and economic\n            opportunities; and, d) Enhance social inclusion, through\n            improved access to schools, health facilities, and wider\n            social interaction. Although the risks of this program are\n            deemed modest, due to Chile's excellent track record in\n            economic management, program implementation, and\n            transparency, some issues nevertheless, deserve attention.\n            These include: some users may sustain increases in waiting\n            and access times, which offset the benefits they obtain in\n            improved trunk travel times; existing transit workers, and\n            operators may resist a change in the status quo, and the\n            proposed public transport reforms; and, a change in\n            government administration due to the next presidential\n            elections, could lower the government's level of\n            commitment to the reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile -

The loans support an ongoing\n            and broad program of reforms in the urban transport sector\n            in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago. The loans are\n            supported by a companion technical assistance loan (Report\n            No: 28521-CL) to help facilitate the achievement of reforms\n            targeted for second tranche release and to provide technical\n            follow-up, monitoring, and strengthening of the\n            implementation of the Santiago Urban Transport Reform. The\n            main development objectives of the SECALS are to improve the\n            level of transport services to the residents (particularly\n            low income residents) and businesses, reduce resource costs,\n            and increase environmental quality. The specific objectives\n            (i) Reduce transport costs in their financial, travel time,\n            and environmental dimensions, and increase transport\n            efficiency; (ii) Improve the coordination o f public sector\n            activities in land use, transport planning, infrastructure\n            investment, traffic management, and bus franchising; (iii)\n            address urban poverty through improving access to jobs and\n            economic opportunities; and (iv) enhance social inclusion\n            through improved access to schools, health facilities, and\n            wider social interaction. Benefits include (i) efficiency\n            improvements that contribute to the city economy and hence\n            economic growth; (ii) resource savings from transferring the\n            bus flows in major corridors to an exclusive space, the\n            reduction of bus vehicle-km on the street system, the\n            rationalization of the route network, and the reduction of\n            revenue risks from operators; (iii) environmental\n            improvements (higher air quality and lower noise); (iv)\n            increased quality of service for passengers who live in the\n            catchment areas of the metro extensions and the new metro\n            line; (v) increased comfort, safety and reliability for bus\n            passengers; (vi) comprehensive coverage of bus feeder routes\n            particularly in poor neighborhoods;  (vii) savings stemming\n            from the implementation of a unified fare system; and (viii)\n            reduced use of 'road space' by car drivers\n            contributing to a reduction in congestion. The risks of this\n            program are deemed modest. Chile's excellent track\n            record in economic management, program implementation and\n            transparency make the satisfactory completion of the program\n            highly likely. Nevertheless, some issues deserving special\n            attention include: increases in waiting and access times;\n            resistance from existing transit workers and operators\n            opposed to a change in the status quo; unsuccessful\n            concession tenders for bus services; potential vulnerability\n            to negative external events including less favorable\n            commodity prices, higher international interest rates,\n            adverse regional developments, as well as domestic factors\n            such as contingent fiscal liabilities, external indebtedness\n            of the corporate sector, and energy supply risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Santiago Urban Transport Deferred\n            Drawdown Sector Adjustment Loan Project and

framework. This environmental\n            assessment (EA) looks first at the physical characteristics\n            (climate, topography, ecology and hydrology) to assess and\n            provide mitigation measures as follows. To prevent soil\n            erosion, appropriate drainage systems should be in place,\n            including maintenance measures to avoid surface, and\n            groundwater contamination. Likewise, soil stabilization\n            measures, and re-vegetation (native plants protective\n            barriers) should further prevent erosion, and landslides.\n            Regular spraying on construction surfaces, and materials\n            would minimize air pollution, while vehicles and equipment\n            should be regularly inspected to avoid contamination due to\n            lubricant, and oil spills. Noise abatement measures shall\n            include protective barriers, daytime working schedules, and\n            traffic speeding. Water supply and sewage treatment plants\n            should be adequately controlled, through regular inspections\n            to prevent toxic, and chemical substances reaching the water\n            supply flows. Following construction, vegetative propagation\n            should be practiced, particularly on slopes, and plants\n            protective barriers.

This environmental\n            assessment (EA) looks first at the physical characteristics\n            (climate, topography, ecology and hydrology) to assess and\n            provide mitigation measures as follows. To prevent soil\n            erosion, appropriate drainage systems should be in place,\n            including maintenance measures to avoid surface, and\n            groundwater contamination. Likewise, soil stabilization\n            measures, and re-vegetation (native plants protective\n            barriers) should further prevent erosion, and landslides.\n            Regular spraying on construction surfaces, and materials\n            would minimize air pollution, while vehicles and equipment\n            should be regularly inspected to avoid contamination due to\n            lubricant, and oil spills. Noise abatement measures shall\n            include protective barriers, daytime working schedules, and\n            traffic speeding. Water supply and sewage treatment plants\n            should be adequately controlled, through regular inspections\n            to prevent toxic, and chemical substances reaching the water\n            supply flows. Following construction, vegetative propagation\n            should be practiced, particularly on slopes, and plants\n            protective barriers.
