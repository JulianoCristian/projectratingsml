Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Multi-Sectoral AIDS Project aims at\n            financing national programs on HIV/AIDS for both the\n            Mainland and Zanzibar governments, in order to reduce the\n            spread of HIV through multi-sectoral actions involving the\n            Government, non-government, civil society and community\n            organizations. To this end, the project components will: 1)\n            mobilize communities to expand, and strengthen activities to\n            be funded within the full spectrum of HIV/AIDS responses for\n            prevention, care, and support, as well as mitigation of\n            socioeconomic impacts of the epidemic. The conceptual basis\n            for this component is that the factors determining the\n            spread of HIV are only to a limited extent under the\n            influence of the Government; thus, where traditional,\n            cultural values become critical, civil society has to play\n            an important role as a partner responsive to the epidemic;\n            2) provide funds to strengthen prevention, care, and\n            mitigation of the epidemic through public sector programs,\n            supporting: a) the Ministry of Health in the HIV/AIDS\n            work-plan, that includes medical interventions, procurement\n            of commodities and services, and awareness campaigns; b)\n            other ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) to\n            implement their own comprehensive work-plans, addressing\n            both the internal, and external impacts of the epidemic in\n            the specific ministry, relative to their work. Capacity\n            building, information education and communication campaigns,\n            and, impact studies will be supported; 3) support the\n            Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS) in fulfilling the\n            HIV/AIDS coordination mandate, i.e., its advocacy, providing\n            leadership responsive to the epidemic, and monitoring and\n            evaluation responsibilities, including institutional\n            strengthening, and core functions related to TACAIDS'\n            mandate; and, 4) support Zanzibar HIV/AIDS similarly to the\n            three previous components to the Mainland, though details\n            within this component will be further elaborated, in a more\n            flexible, dynamic response given the smaller scale of

The report recommends\n            the following priorities: 1) developing an integrated\n            strategy for infection control that will include the safe\n            management of health-care waste; 2) set up Committees for\n            Hospital Hygiene and Infection Control at all levels of the\n            hospital services; 3) consolidation of the legal framework\n            and reinforcement of existing rules and guidelines; 4)\n            standardization of current health-care waste management\n            practices with application of management and monitoring\n            procedures; 5) designation of a health-care Waste Management\n            Officer in larger health-care facilities who will monitor\n            the health-care waste management system; and 6) development\n            of awareness and training programs, and review the curricula\n            of medical and paramedical staff.
