A substantial debt reduction was\n            effected and debt obligations were regularized, favoring a\n            sustainable balance of payments and state budget. However,\n            secondary market prices have fallen, reflecting both the\n            external environment due to the Asian financial crisis, and\n            perceived weakened prospects for Vietnam. The key lessons\n            learned show that the immediate objective of reducing\n            external obligations was achieved in an overall strategy on\n            external debt management. The grant from the Debt Reduction\n            Facility provided legal and financial assistance for\n            mastering the intricacies of international finances and debt\n            restructuring activities, allowing a smooth implementation\n            of the project. The effective cooperation and coordination\n            between the Government and the Bank, gave way to successful\n            preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the project.\n            Nevertheless, experience suggests that a successful debt\n            rescheduling can only be achieved within the context of a\n            viable structural reform program. Further external debt\n            strategies are required, namely, the negotiation of the debt\n            rescheduling package with the Russian Federation, and the\n            coordination of an external debt management for sustainable\n            creditworthiness, servicing external obligations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Debt and Debt Service Reduction\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Debt and Debt Service\n            Reduction Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/01/728062/vietnam-debt-debt-service-reduction-credit-project","projn":"VN-Debt Reduction -- P039914","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Strategic Debt Management,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99031910564637"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,auditors,balance of\n            payments,Bank Performance,banking system,borrowing,capacity\n            building,capital\n            flows,CAPITALS,CD,collateralization,commercial\n            creditors,commercial credits,commercial\n            debt,competitiveness,creditor,creditors,Debt,debt\n            burden,debt buyback,debt instruments,debt management,debt\n            obligations,Debt Reduction,debt relief,debt repayment,debt\n            rescheduling,debt restructuring,Debt Service,debt service\n            ratio,Debt Service Reduction,debt servicing,debt servicing\n            capacity,debt strategy,debts,Development Assistance,discount\n            bonds,economic development,economic expansion,economic\n            growth,economic performance,economic\n            reform,expenditures,exports,external debt,face\n            value,financial crisis,financial markets,financial\n            transactions,FISCAL YEAR,Foreign Exchange,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,growth rate,Institutional development,Interest\n            Rate,legal framework,letters of credit,London\n            Club,macroeconomic adjustment,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,market prices,policy makers,positive\n            effects,present value,principal amount,regulatory\n            framework,resource allocation,sovereign debt,state\n            enterprises,Structural Adjustment,technical assistance,Total\n            costs,World Trade Organization,WTO"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,auditors,balance of\n            payments,Bank Performance,banking system,borrowing,capacity\n            building,capital\n            flows,CAPITALS,CD,collateralization,commercial\n            creditors,commercial credits,commercial\n            debt,competitiveness,creditor,creditors,Debt,debt\n            burden,debt buyback,debt instruments,debt management,debt\n            obligations,Debt Reduction,debt relief,debt repayment,debt\n            rescheduling,debt restructuring,Debt Service,debt service\n            ratio,Debt Service Reduction,debt servicing,debt servicing\n            capacity,debt strategy,debts,Development Assistance,discount\n            bonds,economic development,economic expansion,economic\n            growth,economic performance,economic\n            reform,expenditures,exports,external debt,face\n            value,financial crisis,financial markets,financial\n            transactions,FISCAL YEAR,Foreign Exchange,GDP,Gross Domestic\n            Product,growth rate,Institutional development,Interest\n            Rate,legal framework,letters of credit,London\n            Club,macroeconomic adjustment,macroeconomic\n            stabilization,market prices,policy makers,positive\n            effects,present value,principal amount,regulatory\n            framework,resource allocation,sovereign debt,state\n            enterprises,Structural Adjustment,technical assistance,Total\n            costs,World Trade Organization,WTO"}},"owner":"PREM Sector Department (EASPR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020329-DRF-PREP.
