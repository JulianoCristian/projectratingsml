In\n            1996, the year that the Chinese government launched its\n            National Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) Safe\n            Injection Plan for 1997-2000, only 30 percent of all\n            injections were provided according to the national injection\n            standard of one sterile syringe and one sterile needle for\n            each injection. The Government of China, with assistance\n            from its development partners, has made great strides in\n            improving injection safety. The MOH has issued regulations\n            regarding the safe disposal of medical waste, including\n            injection materials for both immunization and other health\n            (therapeutic) services. However, even today, use of\n            non-sterile syringes, re-use of syringes, and unsafe\n            disposal of syringes is not uncommon. Current financial\n            incentives lead public health facilities to neglect less\n            profitable preventive health care services, in general and\n            injection safety in particular. In order to address this\n            problem, the government should consider: (i) separate\n            accounting systems for free immunization services and\n            for-profit preventive care to assure appropriate use of\n            public monies. The Government needs to clearly define the\n            responsibility of public health care providers and regulate\n            the allocation of public funds. Most importantly, EPI funds\n            should not be used for the provision of for-profit health\n            care; and (ii) establishing a specific fund for the\n            purchase, distribution, and safe disposal of injection\n            material for immunization services. If carefully regulated,\n            such a fund would motivate health care providers to properly\n            use and dispose of injection materials."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Making injections safe in China : how much\n            will it cost and who will pay?"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Making injections safe in China :\n            how much will it cost and who will pay?"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/5569865/making-injections-safe-china-much-cost-pay","projn":"CN-Disease Prevention (Health 7) -- P003589","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Health Systems Development & Reform,Immunizations,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance","docty":"Working Paper (Numbered Series)","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Menon, Rekha"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009486_20050128121329"},"subsc":"General education sector,Health,General public administration sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","colti":"Making Injections Safe in China paper series\n            ; no. 2004-11.","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, cities,\n            clinics, community health, Disease, Disease Control,\n            Economic development, economic reform, Encephalitis,\n            essential drugs, health care, health care financing, Health\n            care provider, health care providers, health care services,\n            health care workers, health centers, health expenditure,\n            health expenditures, Health facilities, health financing,\n            health institutions, Health Insurance, health problems,\n            health programs, health providers, health sector, health\n            services, health system, health technologies, Hepatitis,\n            Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, HIV positive, hospital costs,\n            hospital services, hospitals, Human Immunodeficiency Virus,\n            Immune Deficiency, Immunization, Immunization Coverage,\n            Immunization Programs, Immunization Services, immunizations,\n            Immunodeficiency, income, Infection, infectious diseases,\n            injuries, injury, managers, Measles, medical care, medical\n            services, Medical Wastes, medicine, meningitis, patients,\n            policy documents, polio, preventive health care, Public\n            Health, Public Health Care, public health programs, Public\n            hospitals, rural health, rural health care, Safety, safety\n            measures, Sexually Transmitted Infections, sterilization,\n            STIs, Syringes, Tuberculosis, tuberculosis control, urban\n            health, Vaccination, Vaccines, waste, World Health Organization"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020942-HEALTH PROMOTION COMPONENT OF\n            THE DISEASE PREVENTION PROJECT,TF025197-PHRD-DISEASE PREVENTION PROJECT -,TF025286-PHRD-PREPARATION OF A DISEASE PREVEN.,TF030370-FINLAND CTF FY03 -
