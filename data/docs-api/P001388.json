The Bank's interactions were\n            highly valued. The Ministry of Health (MOH)'s\n            performance during the early stages of the project was\n            clearly affected by the lack of an experienced person as\n            deputy project coordinator, the person who had\n            responsibility for day today monitoring of activities.\n            Despite external training early in the project and efforts\n            by each supervision mission to assist the Project\n            Coordinating Unit (PCU) in utilizing project monitoring\n            systems for tracking activities as well as expenditures,\n            there was little practical follow-up. More serious, however,\n            is the fact that several project objectives were not met\n            either because anticipated activities never took place, or\n            the Government failed to follow-up as required. The major\n            lesson learned is that the project would have benefited a\n            lot from a strong start up foundation which would have\n            entailed a project launching, strong PCU with management\n            systems in place and frequent and consistent missions,\n            especially in the first two years of the project. Finally a\n            well established project documentation system to assist\n            during staff changeovers for both the Bank and the Borrowers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Health and Population Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho - Health and Population Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/05/734246/lesotho-health-population-project","projn":"LS-Health/Pop. -- P001388","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Lesotho","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961006133532"},"subsc":"(Historic)Basic health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"air,Architects,basic health services,child\n            health\n            services,clinics,counselling,decentralization,doctors,dormitories,employment,equipment,extension,Family\n            planning,financial management,health centers,health\n            clinics,health delivery,health education,health\n            expenditures,health facilities,health for all,health\n            manpower,health manpower planning,Health Planning,health\n            providers,health sector,health services,health system,health\n            systems,health systems management,Health Training,hospital\n            management,hospital outpatient\n            services,hospitals,houses,housing,Immunization,laboratories,managers,Maternal\n            & child\n            health,morbidity,mortality,mothers,motivation,needs\n            assessment,nurses,nursing,Nutrition,Primary health\n            care,private sector,probability,public\n            health,radio,radios,rural areas,schools,screening,Sexually\n            transmitted\n            diseases,supervision,Sustainability,transport,urban\n            areas,urban population,village health workers,workers,youth"},"1":{"cdata!":"air,Architects,basic health services,child\n            health\n            services,clinics,counselling,decentralization,doctors,dormitories,employment,equipment,extension,Family\n            planning,financial management,health centers,health\n            clinics,health delivery,health education,health\n            expenditures,health facilities,health for all,health\n            manpower,health manpower planning,Health Planning,health\n            providers,health sector,health services,health system,health\n            systems,health systems management,Health Training,hospital\n            management,hospital outpatient\n            services,hospitals,houses,housing,Immunization,laboratories,managers,Maternal\n            & child\n            health,morbidity,mortality,mothers,motivation,needs\n            assessment,nurses,nursing,Nutrition,Primary health\n            care,private sector,probability,public\n            health,radio,radios,rural areas,schools,screening,Sexually\n            transmitted\n            diseases,supervision,Sustainability,transport,urban\n            areas,urban population,village health workers,workers,youth"}},"owner":"WB Off:Pretoria - Southern AFR 1 (AFCS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"13055"},"740125":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/04/740125/lesotho-health-population-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/04/740125/lesotho-health-population-project","new_url":"1985/04/740125/lesotho-health-population-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/04/01/000009265_3970702135700/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/04/01/000009265_3970702135700/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"1585","datestored":"2001-05-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1985-04-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Health and Population Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Health and Population Project aims\n            to strengthen the organization and management of the\n            Ministry of Health;
