Nonetheless,\n            based on current standards, and perhaps due to the\n            innovative nature of the operation, quality at entry was\n            unsatisfactory, i.e., incomplete at preparation, and unable\n            to help the borrower with project implementation. Lessons\n            suggest, that given a country's post-conflict situation\n            although demand-driven operations may be conducive to build\n            community solidarity and eventually contribute to national\n            reconciliation, infrastructure alone may not be the best\n            instrument for success. Rather, and provided project design\n            is simple, the inclusion of a social fund would probably be\n            a stronger instrument. However, economic and social\n            deterioration may hinder even a well-designed and\n            implemented social fund, jeopardizing poverty reduction, but\n            the significance of its local and beneficial impact should\n            not be underestimated. Furthermore, the experience of true\n            community participation, in assuring timely contribution by\n            beneficiaries to sub-project costs, as well as the\n            maintenance and continued operation of Bank-financed\n            infrastructure, cannot be taken for granted. Thus, future\n            operations should strengthen community participation,\n            particularly in the selection, financing, and management of\n            infrastructure sub-projects and social services delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
