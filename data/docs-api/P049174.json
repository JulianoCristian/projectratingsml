The lessons learned\n            indicate that government commitment to reform over the\n            entire project duration, which has extended to seven years,\n            has been a critical success factor for this project. In the\n            design of this project, attention was carefully focused on\n            functional design issues prior to computerization issues, to\n            ensure effective and efficient implementation. The\n            partnership between the Bank and the Fiscal Affairs\n            Department (FAD) of the IMF in terms of delivery of\n            coordinated policy advice, close monitoring and follow-up\n            has been critical for successful project implementation. The\n            Government's ability to staff the project team with an\n            extremely competent project manager and with a dedicated\n            team of Treasury staff was critical during the testing and\n            implementation phases of the new system. The project closing\n            date had to be extended by two and a half years to complete\n            the project activities. A focused and well-defined program\n            and a single implementing agency are prerequisites to\n            successful and smooth implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Treasury systems
