This report describes the\n            policy, legal, and administrative framework that the project\n            will be nested into. Some of the mitigation measures\n            include: 1) The potential of beel and baor draining will be\n            reduced through bed elevations in the canal and the adjacent\n            river. 2) The possible threat to rice cultivation due to\n            entry of water through a fishpass will be reduced through\n            study of river hydrology and adjustment of pool, baffle, and\n            slot dimensions to minimize discharge volume through\n            fishpass. 3) The potential for eutrophication of natural\n            water courses from pen and cage culture and from prawn farms\n            due to overfeeding and metabolic waste excretion will be\n            reduced by specifying the use of pelleted feeds rather than\n            loose feeds. 4) A comprehensive groundwater survey will be\n            conducted in areas where tubewells are used for prawn farm\n            water sourcing to determine the size of the aquifer and the\n            recharge rate to reduce the danger of groundwater\n            extraction. 5) The problem of overharvesting snail\n            population for prawn feed will be regulated through\n            licensing of collectors and allocation of specific areas to\n            individual collectors.
