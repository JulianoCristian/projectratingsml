This Simplified\n            Implementation Completion Report provides findings and\n            implications for subsequent operations, and identifies three\n            main lessons which can be drawn from the project. First, the\n            number of policy reform areas addressed should be limited,\n            particularly in an environment of political instability. The\n            program for the series should be left more flexible, so as\n            not to overburden the last of the series with an excessive\n            unfinished agenda. A programmatic series with rotating focus\n            from year to year, might better serve this purpose, than a\n            series attempting to implement a large number of areas over\n            a three-year period. Second, performance monitoring\n            indicators should be limited to a core set of indicators\n            which reflect what the program aims to achieve, and then\n            closely monitored; yet, attention needs to be paid to\n            setting up clear baselines from which to measure progress.\n            Third, the presence of a strong country office, which\n            continuously engages in the dialogue, and provides support\n            for implementation, is critical to maintain momentum for\n            such operations, as the experience of this project has\n            clearly shown."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Second Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Second Poverty\n            Reduction
