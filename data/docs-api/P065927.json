Some lessons\n            learned included: technical assistance operations can\n            support broad reforms but their objectives cannot be defined\n            in the same way as the program it supports. This needs to be\n            explicitly stated in the project documents. Realistic\n            scheduling contributes to the success of the project. The\n            scheduling of activities was very optimistic but these were\n            not modified despite recommendations of the Quality\n            Assurance Group (QAG) to this end. The indicator of bringing\n            public enterprises to the point of sale does not normally\n            reflect progress in privatization. This indicator was\n            introduced in early privatization programs when it was\n            believed that the World Bank could not include the actual\n            privatization as an indicator/requirement. In fact, the\n            notion of bringing an enterprise to the point of sale is a\n            relevant indicator only in the case that there are no buyers\n            after a bidding process. A project should be restructured\n            when the design needs adjustments or when conditions have\n            changed. In the case of this project, it became clear early\n            on that Government priorities had changed; it should also\n            have been clear that the planning/budgeting arrangements for\n            the project were too loose. This project confirms broader\n            lessons learned from the implementation of World Bank\n            projects in general. These are consistent with the\n            conclusions of a study conducted by the sector unit to\n            evaluate the recent performance of Private Sector and\n            Finance Projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Public/Private Partnership for\n            Growth and Poverty Reduction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Public/Private\n
