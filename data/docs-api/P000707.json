Some lessons learned included: transfer of\n            appropriate technology to local professionals and easy\n            replicability of programs, such as the forage development\n            and disease investigation components, are important\n            ingredients for sustainability. To ensure an efficient\n            sustainable animal health service, the private sector should\n            have responsibility for importing and distributing\n            veterinary drugs and medicines, and clinical field services\n            should be privatized. Production of forage seed and the\n            development of forage technology at the farm level are\n            crucial to the development of smallholders' livestock\n            farming. Continuity of senior staff in program formulation\n            and implementation is highly associated with successful\n            results. Considerable time and resources can be saved if\n            dubious components such as the foot and mouth disease (FMD)\n            and rabies vaccine production, are excluded from the outset.\n

This is to be achieved by\n            improving animal nutrition and supplying drugs needed to\n            control animal diseases. In addition, other activities to be\n            undertaken will include strengthening the capacities of the\n            Ministry of Agriculture and relevant support services.\n            Finally,
