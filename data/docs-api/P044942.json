The project consists of\n            two components: 1) an investment component to finance a\n            pilot project for a community based water supply and\n            distribution scheme in Kizketken peri-urban area of Nukus in\n            the Republic of Karakalpakstan; and 2) a technical\n            assistance component for management and supervision of pilot\n            project implementation, and for preparation of tender\n            designs and bidding documents for procurement packages for\n            the full scale project, followed by preparation of detailed\n
