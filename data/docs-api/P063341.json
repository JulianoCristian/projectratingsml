Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory.\n            The lessons learned repeat wisdom common to previous\n            adjustment programs. Borrower commitment and ownership is\n            essential. A focus on outcome and performance is critical. A\n            sound banking system is at the center of a successful\n            adjustment program. Monetary policy can play a central role\n            but cannot substitute for sound fiscal policy. Cutting\n            investment expenditures during fiscal adjustment comes with\n            a heavy price. The Bank tends to underestimate the\n            difficulty of political agreements without which reforms\n            cannot happen and remain in place.

The state's debts will be re-financed, and\n            a states facility support will be established to undertake\n            administrative reforms.
