The risk to the development outcome\n            was deemed moderate. Significant observations made during\n            the implementation of the project are: 1) the need to invest\n            heavily in the detailed technical preparation and planning\n            for a project of such technical complexity, 2) projects of\n            this nature and scale should envisage contingency funds or\n            unallocated resources, 3) stability of the teams, both on\n            the borrower's and the Bank's side, is an\n            important contributing factor for continuous dialogue, and\n            4) use of economic assessments and effective communication\n
