Some lessons learned included: 1) it is\n            important to ensure during project preparation that the\n            mandate of the implementing entity is consistent with the\n            scope of the project. The implementation of the two highway\n            projects in China proved unexpectedly challenging because\n            the implementing entity had no jurisdiction over the rural\n            roads and the traffic safety components; 2) some adjustments\n            in the scheduling of safeguards procedures can be\n            considered. The completion of the full resettlement action\n            plan before the preliminary engineering highway design was\n            completed wasted scarce resources as it had to be re-done\n            because the road alignments changed significantly; and 3)\n            since the gap between safeguard policies in the Bank and\n            China on highway projects is now quite small, good\n            supervision is the key to ensuring that the policies are\n            followed. In China, at least in the provinces where the\n            projects were assessed, performance-based project lending\n            has sufficed in respect of safeguards, but the application\n            of the country systems with periodic supervision by the Bank\n            can be contemplated."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Tri-Provincial Highway Project, and\n            Hubei Xiaogan- Xiangfan

Some lessons\n            learned included: it is important that the Task Teams allow\n            sufficient time to properly inspect projects during the\n            construction phase and that the team has the skills to cover\n            all potential issues, especially road safety. With\n            expressway projects such as the Xiaogan-Xiangfan Expressway\n            (XXE), some 224 km long, it can take several days in the\n            field to do a proper inspection. Budget and time constraints\n            can lead to the temptation to reduce the time in the field,\n            but this is to the detriment of the overall project. Through\n            supervision visits, the Task Team helped identify a number\n            of critical issues which, if left unresolved, will have\n            potentially compromised the project's ability to meet\n            the project development objective (PDO). The practice on\n            Bank-financed expressway projects in China has been to\n            include a local road improvement program, typically on the\n            order of 10 percent of the total project size. These have\n            been included to help further ensure that the projects\n            benefit the poor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Hubei Xiaoagan - Xiangfan Highway

The project components will: 1) increase\n            highway capacity, and regional integration, through capital\n            investments in the construction of the Xiaogan - Xiangfan\n            Expressway (XXE). It will link major industrial, and hub\n            cities, and reach less developed counties in the western,\n            and mountainous part of Hubei, stimulating socioeconomic\n            development; 2) include a rural road improvement program, to\n            facilitate accessibility in low-income areas. This component\n            comprises various subprojects for the rehabilitation, and\n            upgrade of existing road sections. The road selection\n            criteria include county income levels, expected impacts on\n            the population served, consistency with provincial\n            priorities, and, economic rate of return; and, 3) strengthen\n            the capacity, and sustainability of highway management in\n            the Province, by building sector institutions, and\n            facilitating institutional transition to the needs of a\n            market economy.

economic development,\n            and trade in Hubei province, by improving its transport\n            links. The increased transport capacity in the\n            Xiaogan-Xiangfan corridor, while improving accessibility in\n            low income areas, will nonetheless affect populations due to\n            necessary reallocation needs. Thus, engineering designs will\n            follow four basic principles: 1) avoid construction in areas\n            close to towns, villages, schools, hospitals, factories, and\n            mining areas; 2) avoid cultural heritage sites; 3) avoid\n            cultivated, and ore deposits areas; and, 4) minimize\n            disturbance to basic infrastructure. This resettlement\n            action plan (RAP), based on public participation, looks at\n            the activities to be carried following consultation with\n            project affected people (PAP), and, assesses compensation as\n            follows. The RAP aims at improving, or at least restore,\n            living conditions of PAPs, and, stipulates that material\n            losses will be compensated at replacement costs, with equal\n            treatment in the absence of property ownership, rather\n            providing help for recovery, and compensation on assets\n            lost. Land compensation will be based at six times the\n            annual average output value, per cultivated land unit, for a\n            period of three years, while crop compensation shall be\n            based on the classification of cultivated land levied.\n            Grievance mechanisms include complaints and appeals at\n            county/district levels, and the right to present lawsuits to\n            civil courts.
