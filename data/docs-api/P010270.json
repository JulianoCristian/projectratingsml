The project achieved its main objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was rated as high,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was fully satisfactory. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, the conversion of a\n            government department into a corporation takes more work and\n            time than generally expected. Second, a higher degree of\n            financial and operational autonomy will lead to more\n            efficient operations. This will be reflected in the\n            performance indicators for satisfaction of demand, service\n            quality, and operational efficiency. Third, technical\n            assistance to maintain proper project cost accounts,\n            especially for local costs, should be provided under the\n            project to enable adequate cost benefit analysis. Finally,\n            PTC's corporatization and the Bank's dialogue with\n            GOP in this matter further accelerated sector restructuring,\n            e.g. market liberalization (private cellular operators,\n            etc.) and, more recently, the privatization of PTC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Fifth Telecommunications Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -
