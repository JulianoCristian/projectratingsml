The outcome of the\n            project was rated moderately satisfactory with the Bank\n            performing moderately satisfactory and the Borrower\n            performing moderately unsatisfactory. The overall risk to\n            development was rated substantial. The project had several\n            monitering and evaluation shortcomings. Therefore, data\n            quality is poor. Although only one indicator (maize yield\n            achieved by farmers with subsidized seed and fertilizer) out\n            of the six project developmetn objective level indicators\n            was fully achieved, the project made significant progress on\n            most of its targets. Four key lessons were learned from the\n            implementation of this project. Firstly, successful\n            implementation of emergency operations significantly\n            benefits from careful advance planning, especially\n            procurement. Secondly, mainstreaming projects in line\n            ministries works best when complemented by pragmatic\n            solutions to implementation issues as they arise. Thirdly,\n            agricultural input voucher programs can significantly\n            increase productivity, but remain difficult to administer.\n            Lastly, a final lesson learned is that inclusion of major\n            civil works (e.g., the irrigation infrastructure) without\n            expedited procurement arrangements, while well meaning, may\n            not be best suited for these type of emergency operations.\n            Such longer gestation investments could divert focus and\n            contribute to implementation delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Accelerated

Accelerated Food Security\n            Project : additional financing"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the\n            Accelerated Food Security Project for Tanzania is to\n            contribute to higher food production and productivity in\n            targeted areas by improving farmers' access to critical\n            agricultural inputs. This project paper seeks the approval\n            of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit\n            in an amount of SDR16.5 million (US$25 million equivalent)\n            to the project. This will be the project's first\n            Additional Financing (AF). The AF will support the scale up\n            of an agricultural input subsidy which has successfully\n            contributed to the expansion of maize and rice production in\n            the country, the improvement of national food security, and\n            the withdrawal of an export ban on grains trade.\n            Specifically, the AF will finance a 30 percent increase in\n            the number of farmers receiving input subsidies during the\n            2012/13 cropping season. This expansion in program coverage\n            is critically important in the context of high international\n            fertilizer prices, and rising international grain prices.\n            The funding will help Tanzania maintain self-sufficiency on\n            grain production. The Government of the United Republic of\n            Tanzania (GoT) has requested continuing International\n            Development Association (IDA) support for its input subsidy\n            program. This was anticipated in the Tanzania Country\n            Assistance Strategy (CAS), with the expectation that the\n            commitment would be defined within the next phase of the\n            Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). However, the\n            development of this commitment has been postponed to allow\n            for a more strategic review of sectoral coordination and\n            performance. The new ASDP funding is now only expected to be\n            available in late 2013. The AF will support the maintenance\n            of the subsidy program during the 2012/13 gap year."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Accelerated Food Security Project\n            : additional
