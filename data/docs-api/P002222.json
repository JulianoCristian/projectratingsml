The project failed to provide\n            the availability of safe potable water in rural settlements,\n            and improve health; instead, it achieved barely a sixth of\n            the targeted area. The development of communal\n            responsibility for facilities, was only partially achieved,\n            because the Government failed to delegate management of the\n            water facilities to the communes. Finally, although cost\n            recovery schemes were established, they remain inadequate to\n            serve operation, maintenance, and, renewal costs. Key\n            lessons suggest that, in situations dealing with\n            post-conflict assistance - and although the Bank was\n            flexible enough through the project restructuring process -\n            this process should properly review the development\n            objectives, and components, since, the assessment of\n            institutional, and, policy reform targets, should be given\n            special attention in project reformulation. Although the\n            project was innovative, with multiple donors, and wide\n            coverage, this design was too complex. This proved negative\n            for the final beneficiaries, since donor funds - largely for\n            civil works - were discontinued due to the country\n            instability. Furthermore, co-financing may largely limit\n            implementation, particularly in post-conflict situations,\n            thus financing should be simple, with possibly, supplemental\n            credits to ease financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Second Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Second Water Supply Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728363/rwanda-second-water-supply-project","projn":"RW-Water Sup.

Benefits under the proposed project\n            are expected to result in improvements in the productivity\n            and well-being of the rural population throughout Rwanda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Second Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Second Water Supply Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/03/740551/rwanda-second-water-supply-project","projn":"RW-Water Sup.
