Key lessons drawn for this project are:\n            The government and the major energy sectors must foster a\n            supportive policy environment through strong and proactive\n            commitment. There is a potential conflict between the narrow\n            goal of maximizing electricity supplies and a DSM program.\n            The implementing agency must have adequate managerial and\n            financial autonomy. Public awareness and promotional\n            campaigns are critical. Energy efficiency audits in the\n            industrial, commercial, and residential sectors need to be\n            properly financed if the audit recommendation are followed\n            up.
