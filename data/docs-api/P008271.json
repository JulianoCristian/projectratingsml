The lessons learned indicate that\n            bottom up approaches were more successful that top down.\n            Technical assistance for institutional reform: greater\n            impacts could be derived by supporting achievement of\n            bench-marked targets within an agreed development program;\n            where institutional capacity is weak, supervision can be\n            effectively augmented through provision of a resident\n            adviser; involving local governments and stakeholders in\n            training and awareness programs is critical for successful\n            decentralization. Communal Forestry: there is significant\n            value in creating a repeatable methodology for working with\n            communities; small but significant steps toward transfer of\n            land ownership provided a strong incentive for local\n            participation, and helped build awareness and capacity for\n            land management. Protected Areas: it is important to build\n            awareness of the needs and opportunities for conservation;\n            operational plans, based on multi-stakeholder input, are key\n            to ensure effective protected area management. Project\n            Management: it is important to establish clear roles and\n            responsibilities for the Project Management Unit (PMU) and\n            the implementing agency; a strategy for carrying out PMU\n            functions following project closure is necessary to ensure sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Forestry Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Forestry Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/11/5508254/albania-forestry-project","projn":"AL-Forestry Project -- P008271","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Forestry,Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Rural Development","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041217104821"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Forestry,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural extension, Agriculture,\n            biodiversity, biodiversity conservation, budgeting,\n            community participation, conservation, cost benefit\n            analysis, crime, Decentralization, decision makers, decision\n            making, economic analysis, ecosystems, employment,\n            environmental assessment, environmental impact,\n            environmental impacts, Environmental Management,\n            Environmental policies, Environmental Protection, equipment,\n            erosion, erosion control, Exchange Rate, exploitation,\n            extension services, families, financial management, forest\n            cover, forest fires, forest investments, forest management,\n            forest products, forest resources, forest sector, FORESTRY,\n            Forests, heating, households, impact assessments, income,\n            incomes, incremental benefits, Information Systems,\n            integration, intervention, land use, leadership, Lessons\n            Learned, logging, management authority, management plans,\n            management services, market factors, market prices,\n            marketing, motivation, natural regeneration, natural\n            resources, non-timber forest products, operating costs,\n            Pastures, poverty alleviation, private sector, productivity,\n            Project Implementation, Project Management, Project\n            Preparation, radio, Reforestation, reforms, refugees,\n            regeneration, rehabilitation, resource management, resource\n            use, rural communities, rural development, service\n            contracts, soil erosion, soils, supervision, Sustainable\n            Development, sustainable management, sustainable resource\n            use, sustainable use, timber, timber prices, wood"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020893-ALBANIA FORESTRY PROJECT,TF020909-ALBANIA FORESTRY PROJECT,TF021836-FINNISH CTF FOR EASTERN &\n            CENTRAL EUROPE,TF022682-PHRD-INTEGRATED FOREST\n            MANAGEMENT PROJ.,TF024127-BNPP - FOREST AND BIODIVERSITY\n            WINDOW - INTEGRATING FOREST-BIODIVERSITY,TF026035-DUTCH TA CTF FOR E.
