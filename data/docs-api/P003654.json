Coordination between\n            Guangdong and Hunan was complicated because Hunan was a\n            first time Bank highway borrower, while for Guangdong it was\n            the second experience. Better information exchanges between\n            provinces could have accelerated the Hunan procurement of\n            electrical and mechanical equipment. 2) With hindsight, the\n            project was approved with insufficient attention paid to\n            surveys and design. 3) While improvements in overweight\n            enforcement will limit the degree of overloading, there are\n            additional measures that should in the future be implemented\n            at the design stage to improve the safety of new roads.\n            Working with the Ministry of Communications to update design\n            standards, improving training of designers, and implementing\n            proper design safety audits would significantly improve the\n            safety situation on similar projects. 4) There was pressure\n            to complete work, which led to the project specifying very\n            tight schedules in its contracts, often necessitating\n            extensions. It also affected quality. It is important to\n            adopt sensible schedules for construction, especially when\n            the terrain is complex. 5) Lastly, it is necessary to\n            carefully review the class and designs of the\n            interconnecting roads to ensure that they are sufficient to\n            meet the likely traffic demand from the expressway."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

Project of China.\n            The section under environmental impact analysis is a\n            four-lane, 169km total access controlled expressway linking\n            the towns of Xiangtan and Leiyang, which is to be\n            constructed between 1996 and 1999.  The three phases of\n            project implementation are design, construction, and\n            operation.  For each of these phases the potential impacts\n            on the environment have been examined, with special\n            consideration paid to the areas of ecological protection,\n            soil erosion, leakage of hazardous materials, flood control,\n            maintenance of drainage systems, waste management, vehicle\n            management, land occupation, resettlement of occupants,\n            cultural relic preservation, and noise, water and\n            atmospheric pollution.  Mitigation measures have been\n            developed to prevent and combat potential adverse\n            environmental effects of the project.  These are included in\n            plans of environmental management, supervision, monitoring,\n            and action, which will require the participation of both the\n            government and the public.  It has been concluded by this\n            environmental assessment that the environment will suffer no\n            serious consequences as a result of the project.  It states\n            that all adverse impacts can be mitigated or eliminated by\n            implementing the environmental protection measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second National Highway
