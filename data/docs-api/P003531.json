The project was not\n            implemented as the entire loan was canceled on December 12,\n            1997 at the request of the Borrower, owing to differences of\n            opinion in the procurement of major equipment for the power\n            plant. No disbursement was made from the loan. Some of the\n            lessons learned from the project are: 1) procurement being\n            the single most important operation in loan administration,\n            it is extremely important for the Bank to ensure that the\n            knowledge base on the Bank's procurement guidelines in\n            the Borrower's country is maintained at the highest\n            level at all times. In the shorter term, procurement\n            workshops are organized to acquaint project beneficiaries\n            with Bank procurement guidelines and procedures at the early\n            stages of project preparation. In the longer term, there is\n            a proposal to establish procurement training courses in\n            Chinese universities. The universities, in turn, will offer\n            this training on a continuing basis. This initiative will be\n            supported by the Bank in the earlier years of its\n            implementation; 2) to ensure best practice in procurement\n            processing, the Bank needs not only to perform a careful\n            review of all documents, but also wide consultation\n            involving external technical/procurement staff, as\n            necessary. This approach has been very helpful in developing\n            a consensus during the review of the evaluation of the\n            project by the Bank. The external consultant's\n            independent opinion also played a central role in reaching a\n            decision; and 3) procurement efficiency can only be ensured\n            if project implementation is done with due diligence and\n            without extraneous considerations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Henan (Qinbei) Thermal Power
