The project was successful in protecting\n            several of Congo's important ecosystems: it established\n            a national park in primary closed forest, a community\n            reserve in an inundated forest, and a sanctuary in savannah\n            and gallery forest, and reinforced an established reserve.\n            However, the achievement of objectives is considered\n            marginal due to the impact of civil war and unrest, the high\n            turnover of senior government officials that delayed many\n            activities, and the numerous misunderstandings between\n            government and the trustee regarding project objectives and\n            implementation. Project sustainability is unlikely. Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are adjudged\n            satisfactory. Principal lessons include: The cross-sectoral\n            nature of the project initially resulted in little\n            ownership. This was exacerbated by the large role of\n            international nongovernmental organizations. By project end,\n            both of these factors were seen as strengths and the project\n            succeeded due to both government partnerships and the strong\n            and independent role of the NGOs. Because NGOs were directly\n            included in project management, continuity was maintained\n            when government upheaval occurred. NGOs also provided\n            cross-fertilization of ideas and solutions to problems never\n            encountered by the government. And, the cross-sectoral\n            nature and NGO involvement attracted a lot of international\n            media, which promoted national ownership and international recognition."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Wildlands Protection and Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo - Wildlands Protection and\n            Management

continued monitoring of\n            key biodiversity indicators, and systematic planning and\n            coordination of conservation activities, at the national\n            level; and (b) careful management of selected reserves, at\n            the local level.  At the national level, the project will\n            lay the groundwork for a permanent structure in charge of\n            all conservation activities by creating a Project Management\n            Unit (PMU) and a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) to\n            manage and monitor the project in the interim.  The project\n            will also support the capacity-building of the Directorate\n            in charge of protected areas, the National Herbarium, the\n            National Geographic and Cartographic Center, and national\n            nongovernmental organizations.  At the local level, the\n            project will focus on five sites representative of the\n            country's biodiversity:  Nouabale-Ndoki, primary closed\n            forest; Conkouati, mixed gallery forest, savannah and\n            mangrove swamp; Dimonika, mixed closed forest; Lefini,\n            savannah and gallery forest; and Lake Tele-Likouala,\n            inundated forest.  Additional inventory and survey work will\n            be carried out in Mt. Fouari, Mt. Nabemba-Garibenzam and\n            other sites for possible inclusion at a later stage.  In the\n            five priority reserves, the project will support the\n            development and execution of rational management plans,\n            including alternative activities for local populations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Memorandum et recommendation"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo \u2013 Projet de conservation et\n            de gestion des aires prot\u00e9g\u00e9es : M\u00e9morandum et recommandation"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/12/12707347/congo-wildlands-protection-project-memorandum-recommendation","projn":"CG-Wildlands Protection -- P000535","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Wetlands,Pharmaceuticals & Pharmacoeconomics,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Management","docty":"GEF Project Document","teratopic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Water Resources","count":"Congo, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20100830030222"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Forestry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental management; Protected areas;\n            Nongovernmental organizations; Plant ecology; Nature\n            conservation; Forest conservation; Wildlands; Nature\n            reserves; Environmental protection,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Environmental management; Protected areas;\n            Nongovernmental organizations; Plant ecology; Nature\n            conservation; Forest conservation; Wildlands; Nature\n            reserves; Environmental protection,,"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 3 (AFTS3)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028622-GET-CONGO WILDLANDS PROTECT.\n            & MANAGE.,TF028611-GET-PPA FOR CONGO WILDLANDS PROTECTION","repnb":"10590","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Congo - Projet de Conservation et de\n            Gestion des Aires Protegees"}}},"facets":{}}}
