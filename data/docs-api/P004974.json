Some of the key\n            lessons are: Outcome is highly unsatisfactory;\n            sustainability is highly unlikely; Institutional development\n            impact is negligible; Bank performance is unsatisfactory;\n            Borrower performance is unsatisfactory. Several lessons can\n            be drawn from this project. Some of the key lessons are: 1)\n            Keep the project design simple and set realistic targets\n            based on previous country experience: Starting from\n            ill-defined development objectives, the project did not link\n            the institutional capacity strengthening to previous results\n            on the ground and lessons learned from past Bank projects.\n            Implementing agencies had not demonstrated in previous Bank\n            operations that they were capable of successfully executing\n            complex and extensive components. Furthermore the activities\n            included in the institutional components proved to be\n            insufficient to fully achieve the strengthening objectives,\n            specifically regarding the improvement of the financial\n            capacity of the sector providers. 2) Implementation\n            responsibility must be clearly defined and given to the\n            agency that will be ultimately be responsible for the\n            operation of the water supply networks. 3) In water supply\n            rehabilitation projects, where the knowledge of the physical\n            conditions of the network is limited, the works contract\n            should be preceded (or run in parallel) to a consultancy\n            that will help locate the problems and assign them to the\n            contractors. 4) The service contracts - as designed for this\n            project - should have been split into two components: the\n            works contract and the technical assistance contract for all\n            other services (studies, leak detection, GIS and commercial\n            cadastre and system improvement). 5) The Bank management\n            should have been more reactive and take corrective measures\n            much earlier. When it was becoming clear around the mid-term\n            review (1998) that the Borrower and the implementing agency\n            were reluctant to implement the agreed reforms, loan\n            conditions and project design, the Bank management should\n            have been more proactive and not allow the already\n            accumulated implementation delays to increase. It should\n            have been unacceptable to sign the contracts after 5 years\n            from effectiveness (and their amendments) when it was known\n            that the contracts would go beyond the closing date. 6) To\n            implement new reforms in the sector, it would be more\n            appropriate to design pilot project of much smaller scale to\n            test the commitment of the Government and the feasibility of\n            the reform. 7) Large complex projects (with many contracts)\n            require competent project management capacity to be on board\n            from the beginning. 8) The Government should show their\n            commitment to reforms by initiating them prior to project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Water Supply
