Some lessons learned\n            included: problem projects can become successful, but they\n            require intensive implementation support and a thorough\n            reflection as to the very issues that affect implementation.\n            Implementation support for investment lending can be used\n            effectively to reinforce sectoral policy dialogue, but,\n            unless there is clear commitment by the government to\n            sectoral policy reform, it should not be the driving force\n            behind that dialogue. One size does not fit all with respect\n            to targeting of social protection assistance. Proxy means\n            testing (PMT) may be considered the best standard in\n            targeting methodology, specifically for its ability to\n            predict poverty status and ranking all beneficiaries in a\n            given registry. Combining what is in effect policy\n            conditionality in an investment loan or credit or grant\n            should only be done in the context of a clear commitment by\n            the government. Poor institutional arrangements can have an\n            adverse impact on the prospects for success in project\n            implementation. Social protection projects, especially those\n            that aim at increasing the efficiency of existing systems,\n            in particular cash transfer programs, face large challenges\n            when exogenous factors impact the livelihoods of the covered\n            population. Building institutional capacity in implementing\n            agencies presents challenges between utilizing government\n            civil servants or relying on external consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Social Protection Enhancement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Social Protection\n            Enhancement
