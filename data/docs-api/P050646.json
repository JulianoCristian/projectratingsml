Some lessons\n            learned included: Building on a pilot project, which in\n            itself was a lesson in scaling-up, has produced a set of\n            robust and highly efficient systems for intervention suited\n            to the particular needs of sodic land reclamation while at\n            the same time targeting the needs of the poor. These systems\n            can provide for technically sound and transparent criteria\n            for area and beneficiary selection, which target the poor,\n            without excluding benefits to the wider community. While the\n            project systems developed for area and beneficiary selection\n            have worked extremely well, they may have done so partly\n            because of the relative homogeneity of the targeted lands\n            and groups, and the quick visible returns to sodic land\n            reclamation. This bodes well for scaling-up on further\n            larger areas of sodic lands, but considerable effort and\n            resources may be needed to extend these approaches to more\n            complex environments (such as ravine areas in the region).\n            Community mobilization and preparatory activities are\n            essential for successful sodic land reclamation. These\n            result in delayed disbursement in the initial years,\n            followed by accelerated disbursement in the later years."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Uttar Pradesh Sodic

especially rice and wheat, in Uttar Pradesh,\n            India's largest state and one of its poorest. In 1993,\n            the state, its farmers and communities, and the World Bank\n            joined together to address these problems and create\n            long-term solutions. A key part of the project was assuring\n            land ownership for the farmers. The phases of the\n            reclamation process was followed: testing the soil, digging\n            surface drainage, building tube-wells, applying the gypsum\n            and water for leaching, flushing with good-quality\n            groundwater, planting crops, and regularly continuing to\n            flush salts from the link drains. Within six months, farmers\n            experienced improved agricultural productivity and enjoyed\n            higher incomes. The program model was so successful that the\n            government of Uttar Pradesh planned to follow it in all\n            future sodic land reclamation. Project staff also helped\n            establish women's savings and credit groups to\n            supplement family incomes. Banks began to offer the groups\n            credit for dairy farming, sewing, tree nurseries, and trading."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Reclaiming barren agricultural

Active community\n            participation and well coordinated government intervention\n            are critical elements in the project approach. 2) The\n            rehabilitation and maintenance of main drains component will\n            improve the drain network which will have positive\n            environmental impact by reversing, arresting, or delaying\n            the process the sodic land formation. 3) Technology\n            dissemination will establish a community-based, demand\n            driven system for technology dissemination in the project\n            districts. 4) Upgrading farm to market roads will take up\n            rural roads construction in areas where sodic land is being\n            reclaimed. 5) Human resources development and institutional\n            capacity building of support services will focus on staff\n            training and institutional strengthening in the Panchayats,\n            nongovernmental organizations, and executing government\n            agencies. 6) Adaptive research will verify and refine the\n            available technologies to suit the specific needs of local\n            farmers and to bring about sustainable increases in the\n            productivity of sodic lands through reclamation. 7) Project\n            management will be the responsibility of the Uttar Pradesh\n            Bhumi Sudhar
