Some lessons learned included: When\n            Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) is implemented by an\n            agency that does not have previous experience, it is better\n            to start with a pilot operation as a first stage of the\n            project to minimize the implementation costs associated with\n            such an extended learning curve. According to the project\n            evaluation, a quarter of the organizations reported that the\n            National Council of Women (CNM, its Spanish acronym) was not\n            able to respond to their technical and administrative\n            inquiries or requests for assistance, resulting in that 72\n            percent of the organizations had to make changes in their\n            timetables and 54 percent in their budget during the\n            implementation of the sub-projects. Monitoring and\n            evaluation systems should take into account the possibility\n            of delays and other changes in project implementation so as\n            to provide other evaluation options if need be. Due to the\n            crisis, the changes in administration and other\n            institutional and technical problems, the PROFAM impact\n            evaluation component could not be fully developed.\n            Arrangements should be sought between the Bank and the\n            implementing agency for continuing evaluation after the\n            project is finished. The level of experience of the\n            organizations, their capacity to formulate sound\n            methodologies for applying the social capital and gender\n            approach as well as their available resources are key\n            factors that ensure a successful integration of this approach."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Family Strengthening and Social\n            Capital

comprehensive units and promoting\n            gender equality. The project has three components: The first\n            has two sub-components that implement the \"Programa\n            Equidad,\" a demand-driven grant program for developing\n            small sub-projects which promote and strengthen the capacity\n            of families to actively function within their community; and\n            support the strengthening of existing networks or\n            associations of community-based organizations and other\n            civil society organizations through capacity building and\n            technical assistance, and in some instances the provision of\n            basic equipment such as computers or printers. Priority will\n            be given to those networks that demonstrate innovative\n            approaches to family strengthening, facilitate the\n            participation of the family, and promote more equitable\n            gender relations. The second component promotes\n            awareness-raising and communication strategies at a\n            micro-level that seeks to directly impact the project target\n            areas to further enhance\n            government-civil-society-community-family relationships,\n            respect for non-traditional gender roles among youth and\n            children, etc. The third component
