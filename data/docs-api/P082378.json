Some lessons learned included:\n            Vigilant follow-up needs to take place at the school level.\n            The Ministry of Education (MoE) should provide ongoing\n            capacity building to teachers and school heads in the\n            principles of accountability and transparency. Further,\n            community engagement must continue to be stressed in order\n            to shore up the positive gains of the project. The Ernest\n            and Young report points to potential backsliding on the\n            decentralized procurement practices which needs to be\n            identified and addressed on a continual basis. Leadership is\n            essential to success. While the Bank task team did an\n            excellent job in project design and supervision, the success\n            of the project could not have been realized without the\n            strong and dedicated leadership of the MoE. The main lesson\n            here is that leadership capacity cannot be underestimated in\n            development and implementation of successful projects.\n            Integrity, dynamism, bold decision making, vision, and\n            taking unpopular political decisions characterize some of\n            the most important elements of leadership in this project.\n            As a result of this leadership, the new policies of\n            decentralization were enforced (ensuring that booksellers\n            followed the rules), new partnerships were struck (with the\n            commercial banks), a strong foundation of trust was built\n            with the Bank and a new esprit de corps developed amongst\n            technical staff in the Ministry. While these positive\n            aspects can be cited, leadership capacity could have been\n            improved in areas such as organizational management\n            (establishing proper functions such as procurement to\n            support the project in the Ministry), evidence-based and\n            data-driven decision making, and increased capacity building\n            among technical level staff including establishment of\n            clearer policies to provide incentives for skill\n            acquisition. Overall, however, leadership provided the key\n            element to the successful implementation of this project.\n            For the future, this aspect should be taken into greater\n            consideration in project preparation and risk assessment.\n            Free Primary Education does not necessarily result in a drop\n            in quality. One of the key lessons gained from this project\n            is that despite the infusion of an additional 1.5 million\n            learners in the system, the quality of education need not be\n            compromised, and that in fact, the data support an increase\n            in quality particularly for the poorest schools. This\n            experience will be important to communicate and will impact\n            other Bank clients looking at perceived trade-offs of free\n            primary education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Free Primary Education Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Free Primary Education\n            Support

complete a\n            full course of primary schooling by Year 2015. There are\n            three components to the project: 1) The bulk of project\n            funds would be used for the scaling-up of the recently\n            evaluated Government/DFID textbook program, using school\n            grants, the existing procurement system (which is considered\n            to be competitive), and the existing financial management\n            system (though with additional training of school staff and\n            local community representatives). 2) The proposed capacity\n            building component would have four sub-components: (i)\n            school-based teacher development and support; (ii) school\n            accounting system; (iii) education management information\n            system; and (iv) system design and program preparation. 3)\n            This component has three activities: (i) monitoring; (ii)\n            evaluation; and (iii) external audit.
