Some\n            lessons learned include: the procurement lessons learned in\n            the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for works and\n            large value consulting contracts for post-conflict\n            environments are finding interested contractors and\n            consultants with adequate capacity and experience to work in\n            a fragile state; engineering estimates for critical works\n            and installations in post-conflict countries, especially\n            those to be bid under ICB, should appreciate, recognize and\n            accommodate the influence of potential bidders'\n            perceived risks and uncertainties in the post-conflict\n            environment, in order to provide realistic working estimates\n            for critical post conflict infrastructure to facilitate\n            effective budgeting; and there is need for early\n            identification of qualified firms in the market, relative to\n            required specialized and or critical services and engage\n            their interest. Wherever possible, consider an amalgamation\n            of resources into one sizeable project. Project design\n            lessons learned are: it is important not to design projects\n            that are overambitious in scope, since this may lead to\n            critical activities not being implemented by others and\n            increasing risks in a fragile situation. A well laid out\n            structure for institutional collaboration in a\n            well-coordinated manner for all project activities is\n            fundamental to effective implementation of such projects,\n            especially for multiple stakeholders. Supervision of\n            specialist assignments should not be entrusted to a\n            governmental unit until it has demonstrated previously that\n            it is capable of handling the task. Extraordinary efforts\n            need to be made to attract contractors and consultants to a\n            country during the project preparation phase. Timely\n            oversight mechanism and support is extremely necessary in a\n            post-conflict environment where the circumstances are fast\n            changing and evolving, particularly, on problems\n            identification and early reporting by the technical staff\n            during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia - Infrastructure Rehabilitation
