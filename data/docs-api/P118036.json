Some lessons learned included: relevant\n            analytical work in countries where there are few investment\n            operations can serve as a critical input for engaging the\n            government on key issues and eventually the design of future\n            lending operations. Analytical work including the draft 2010\n            public expenditure review, social sector policy notes in\n            health and education, and a research paper on youth and\n            employment at the time of the program's preparation\n            served as the entry point for many of the policy discussions\n            on the social sectors and provided critical inputs in the\n            design of some policy areas under the program. It also\n            prepared the Bank to adequately respond to the technical\n            assistance demands of the government and eventually the\n            preparation of new none lending and lending operations.\n            Relevant analytical work can be a critical tool for\n            remaining engaged with a government even when there are few\n            lending operations in country. In order to prepare projects\n            rapidly and ensure that they are of the highest quality, it\n            is critical to have the full commitment of both the Bank and\n            the government. The successful rapid preparation of this\n            program can be strongly attributed to the overwhelming\n            commitment in time and resources of both the Bank and the\n            government. Taking a risk and supporting sound policies\n            where the government has a strong commitment, even if the\n            Bank has not done prior analytical work, is useful\n            especially if it opens the door for a longer-term\n            engagement. Prior to the preparation of the Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL), the Bank had completed a policy note on\n            the quality of education in El Salvador, focusing on the\n            analysis of test scores and other measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador - Sustaining Social Gains for\n            Economic Recovery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"El Salvador -
