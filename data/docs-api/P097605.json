There\n            were three lessons learned.  First, following a major\n            natural disaster, such as the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, it is\n            possible to adapt an approach and implementation\n            arrangements of a previously designed project, facilitating\n            quick project start-up to provide urgently needed\n            assistance; however, it is crucial to carefully draw lessons\n            from the existing project before emulating.  Second, a newly\n            created Ministry, appointed as the implementing agency of a\n            newly designed and complex project in a post-disaster area\n            for which they actually have neither a mandate nor the\n            expertise, will take considerable time to get organized and\n            up to speed with project implementation. When dealing with a\n            new ministry or implementing agency, additional training,\n            special consultants and associated implementation support\n            must be provided in the project and by the Bank's task\n            team.  Third, Implementation of a complex project dealing\n            with low-capacity stakeholders cannot rely solely on Bank\n            budget for effective implementation support. Grants from\n            trust funds allowed frequent and comprehensive\n            implementation support involving specialist resources.\n            However, when using a large number of trust funds,\n            coordination and integration of trust-funded activities is\n            difficult to achieve, especially at the national level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

The World Bank distributed\n            peace posters and copies of the peace agreement, is piloting\n            peace radio training, and is part of Forum Bersama which\n            supports the reintegration of former combatants into their\n            communities. The Kecamatan Development Program (KDP) program\n            is working with the International Organization for Migration\n            to provide reintegration grants. The Support for Poor and\n            Disadvantaged Areas (SPADA) program will bring conflict and\n            neglected areas into the reconstruction process. Bank\n            support for the peace process includes working closely with\n            the Aceh Monitoring Mission, EU, the International\n            Organization for Migration, UNDP, United States and Japan in\n            cooperation with the Provincial Government. The program\n            includes a comprehensive research program to support policy\n            making. This has involved completing a comprehensive GAM\n            reintegration needs assessment based on extensive\n            quantitative evidence (survey of 638 GAM combatants, census\n            of 1,700 prisoners, media monitoring) and qualitative\n            fieldwork (700 people interviews in 38 villages); it will\n            also include analytical work on the upcoming elections, an\n            evaluation of the reintegration program, and a study looking\n            at how to mainstream conflict sensitive principles into\n            tsunami aid. The Bank has helped develop innovative\n            approaches for monitoring corruption across the main Aceh\n            transport routes to track demands for illicit payments,\n            which have contributed to rising construction costs. Early\n            results have shown rising levels of extortion at weigh\n            stations and fees to ensure security. The Bank is also\n            conducting on-going monitoring of conflict trends and\n            reintegration dynamics at the request of the Provincial Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank support to the peace process"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank support to the peace process"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/04/23963246/world-bank-support-peace-process","count":"Indonesia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"combatants, communities, community\n            reconstruction, conflict, conflicts, corruption, districts,\n            elections, extortion, International Organization,\n            interventions, justice, leadership, media, needs assessment,\n            Peace, Peace Process, Project Design, Project Documents,\n            reconstruction, UNDP, victims, villages"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","topic":"Arbitration m1327021 1857,Land and Housing m1327648 817,Peacekeeping m1327311 2471,Post-Conflict Reconstruction m1326835 2480,Public Sector Management m1326314 696","projn":"ID-Spada In Aceh And Nias -- P097605","subtopic":"Post Conflict Reconstruction,Peace & Peacekeeping,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Post Conflict Reintegration,Housing & Human Habitats","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Conflict and Development,Public Sector Development,Social Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150205145112"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"General education sector,Other social services,Health","theme":"Infrastructure services for private sector development,Other social development","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Conflict and Development,Public Sector Development,Social Development","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","topicv3":"Arbitration m1327021 1857,Land and Housing m1327648 817,Peacekeeping m1327311 2471,Post-Conflict Reconstruction m1326835 2480,Public Sector Management m1326314 696","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF057955-SUPPORT FOR POOR AND\n            DISADVANTAGED AREAS PROJECT,TF090666-SPADA FOR ACEH TRUST FUND -\n            MONITORING AND EVALUATION CAPACITY BUILDING,TF090725-SPADA FOR ACEH - EMPOWERING\n            WOMEN IN ACEH,TF090761-ID-TF SPADA MCLE ACEH\n            (MEDIATION AND COMMUNITY LEGAL EMPOWERMENT),TF090789-SPADA FOR ACEH - ECONOMIC\n            GOVERNANCE IN ACEH PROJECT,TF090807-ADDITIONAL FINANCING FOR\n            SUPPORT FOR POOR AND DISADVANTAGED AREAS (SPAD,TF091149-SUPPORT FOR POOR AND\n            DISADVANTAGED AREAS PROJECT (SPADA) - PSYCHOSOCIAL,TF091675-SPADA FOR ACEH - WOMEN LEGAL EMPOWERMENT,TF092647-MDF FOR ACEH AND NORTH SUMATRA:\n            SPADA-ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE IN ACEH PROJE,TF093074-MDF FOR ACEH AND NORTH SUMATRA:\n            SPADA-ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE IN ACEH PROJ-,TF094014-ID-CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND\n            MEDIATION TRAINING FOR PNPM FACILITATORS AND,TF094912-Aceh Youth Radio for\n            Peacebuilding II","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"92435"},"facets":{}}}
