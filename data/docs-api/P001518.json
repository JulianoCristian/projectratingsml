Frequent changes in the members of supervision\n            missions, particularly when total, do however pose problems\n            in understanding the project's evolution, or desired\n            evolution, and its environment, and in making optimal and\n            timely decisions. The recent establishment of an\n            interlocutor in the field can only enhance relations between\n            the borrower and the financial institution. More attention\n            needs to be paid to the initial appraisal of projects,\n            particularly in analyzing socioeconomic factors that have,\n            or could potentially have, a
