The\n            overall assessment of the project's outcome is\n            marginally unsatisfactory. The key lessons learned are: 1)\n            Targeted interventions are effective tools for reaching\n            vulnerable populations. 2) To maximize impact, investments\n            must take into consideration medium-term aspects related to\n            sustainability. 3) Even with laudable objectives, the\n            success of a project rests on implementation arrangements.\n            4) The informal sector is an extremely important part of the\n            Chadian economy, especially among the most vulnerable\n            populations. 5) Creating services to support the informal\n            sector and micro-enterprise will require a long-term\n            commitment to designing demand-responsive interventions,\n            building institutional capacity, and creating a conducive\n            regulatory and legal framework. 6) Within the health sector,\n            cost recovery strategies at the primary and secondary levels\n            are a viable and attractive option for improving the\n            utilization of health centers and quality of service\n            delivery, if matched with reliable supply of affordable\n            essential drugs. 7) Large-scale urban infrastructure\n            investments are best implemented within integrated urban\n            development programs. 8) Without a Government agency\n            designated for the definition and coordination of social\n            policies, studies analytical work and policy formulation is\n            best carried out with the ministries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Social
