Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: 1) in designing future Bank projects with on-lending to\n            private borrowers, the Bank may need to study the private\n            sector's decision making process towards official\n            development finance. A proper understanding of the private\n            sector to find out the level of commitment and how it is\n            expressed may be vital; and 2) the critical issue facing the\n            distribution utilities is to become sufficiently\n            credit-worthy to secure loans and equity capital on their\n            own in the capital market. As in the case of Manila Electric\n            Company (MERALCO), available official development finance\n            can help them begin that process. The problem is one of\n            devising legally appropriate transitional financing\n            mechanism for channeling the development finance. To the\n            extent that some of the remaining 145 distribution companies\n            in the Philippines, representing some 40 percent of the\n            distribution capacity, become credible borrowers through a\n            consolidation program, Development Bank of the Philippine\n            (DBP) could serve as a channel for development finance to\n            recast their operations and finances to be able to meet\n            their future development finance from the market."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Manila Power Distribution Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Manila Power\n            Distribution Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/11/733329/philippines-manila-power-distribution-project","projn":"PH-Manila Power Dist.
