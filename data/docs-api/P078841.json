The\n            lessons learned indicate that the decision to do a single\n            tranche operation was adequate in view of the Government\n            strategy to pursue a two stage approach designed to, first,\n            achieve stabilization of the country's finances and\n            initiate key reforms to encourage a resumption of growth\n            while, second, identifying and implementing a comprehensive\n            medium-term program of reforms to restore growth and\n            competitiveness. The successful implementation of the\n            Government's program followed from its strong ownership\n            and commendable degree of commitment. The very binding\n            capacity constraints, arising in significant part from the\n            inherent diseconomies of scale involved in a small island\n            public sector, have required the judicious selection of\n            measures to those that are likely to make the greatest\n            impact and are critical to the successful achievement of the\n            program objectives. The complexity of the project placed\n            great pressure on economic managers and showed the need for\n            flexibility on the part of lead donors such as the Bank and\n            Fund. Close coordination among donors in the provision of\n            financial and technical assistance greatly contributed to\n            the outcome of the reform program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominica

The proposed (ERSO) is a\n            single-tranche structural adjustment credit in the amount of\n            US$3 million equivalent. The operation will support the\n            authorities' efforts to: (a) improve public expenditure\n            management, through reforms in financial and debt management\n            and a restructuring of the public sector investment program;\n            (b) strengthen the financial sector reforms by\n            commercializing the state-owned banks and improving\n            supervision of the credit union sub-sector; and (c) reduce\n            the cost of doing business through reforms in the petroleum,\n            electricity and transport sectors. The operation focuses on\n            the most urgent measures required for fiscal consolidation\n            and a resumption or growth and on areas of the Bank's\n            comparative advantage. The operation's concessional\n            terms will reduce the government's borrowing costs and\n            lengthen debt maturities at the margin.
