Faso - HIV/AIDS Disaster Response\n            Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This environmental assessment for the\n            HIV/AIDS Disaster Prevention Project for Burkina Faso\n            elaborates a pertinent system of health care waste planning\n            and management whose implementation will allow improved\n            public health. This report recommends the following\n            treatment and elimination systems: modern incinerators\n            appropriate for national hospitals; the one-combustion room\n            incinerator, a home-made incinerator appropriate for urban\n            areas; and stabilized and side and bottom pits for Centers\n            for Health and Social Promotion (CSPS) in rural areas,\n            community health centers, and isolated maternities. To\n            prevent inappropriate incinerators or non-combustibles\n            (plastic, chemical, and radioactive products, mercury, heavy\n            metals, etc.) from polluting the air, and to spreading the\n            risk of contamination from infectious waste, the model of\n            incinerator recommended will be based on waste segregation\n            at the source. All types of waste will not be incinerated.\n            Selective sifting will help send all non-contaminated waste\n            towards more classical treating systems (disinfection,\n            burial, garbage dumps) and only incinerate contaminated or\n            risk-based wastes (needles, etc.). These categories of waste\n            do not emit (or very likely do not emit) targeted toxic\n            products, especially dioxins and mercury. Moreover, the\n            system allows total melting of needles, which are the most\n            feared vectors for accidental transmission of HIV/AIDS. The\n            report recommends encapsulation, chemical disinfection, and\n            storage in empty containers (bottles). In all cases,\n            reusable instruments must be sterilized. In health centers\n            located in provincial and rural areas, segregating waste\n            will reduce the volume of waste significantly. Also, using\n            non-chlorinated plastic containers should reduce pollution\n            caused by incineration. Public landfills will receive\n            treatment refuse (ashes from incineration, etc.). for liquid\n            wastes, chemical disinfection will be used to treat\n            infectious waste. A combined waste system (disinfecting and\n            septic tank) will be employed for provincial and rural\n            areas, and it is preferable apply physical-chemical\n            treatment to hospital waste."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -
