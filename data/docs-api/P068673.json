Third Road Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Third Road\n            Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project for Nicaragua were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            importance of experience and lessons learned under previous\n            projects. International Development Association (IDA) and\n            government experience from previous operations in the sector\n            helped to enhance supervision effectiveness and ensured\n            leadership and involvement during project implementation.\n            Transport sector operations initiated by IDA had\n            continuously pursued the objectives of improving managerial\n            efficiency and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks in\n            Nicaragua. In this context, each project was supportive in\n            the introduction of innovative strategies such as road\n            stabilization programs, sustainable mechanisms for periodic\n            and routine maintenance, and expanding private sector\n            participation in the sector. Road Stabilization (Adoquine)\n            Program is highly appropriate for the rural poor. The Rural\n            Roads Stabilization Program (PEA) yielded several important\n            advantages in terms of social and economic outcomes. As a\n            cost-effective rehabilitation method, the use of adoquines\n            reduced maintenance costs and facilitated the participation\n            of small local businesses. It also uses local technology and\n            materials, supports bicycle traffic, and has a very low\n            environmental impact. The PEA has proved to be a very\n            effective instrument to generate productive short term\n            employment for skilled and unskilled workers from the\n            communities, through the mobilization of local resources\n            (material, labor, and technology), expansion of community\n            and local involvement in planning and decision making, and\n            the organization of communities in addressing local needs.\n            This type of program is very cost effective and can produce\n            positive social and economic impacts in the beneficiary zones."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Third Road Rehabilitation and\n            Maintenance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Third Road\n            Rehabilitation and

   sustainability of road improvements. The components will: 1)\n            finance rehabilitation, and improvements of the Managua -\n            Izapa, and the Muhan - El Rama roads. Rehabilitation will be\n            within the existing right of way, and will encompass bus\n            pullover areas, and road shoulders to improve traffic\n            safety, in addition to pavement recycling techniques to\n            finalize road sections of the Managua-Izapa road, already\n            improved under a previous operation, as well as the Muhan-El\n            Rama road, including existing alignments, drainage, and road\n            signaling works; 2) stabilize rural secondary, and tertiary\n            roads, primarily within the region devastated by Hurricane\n            Mitch, under private contractors, who will restore roads to\n            gravel standards. Consulting services will assist the\n            Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (MTI) during\n            implementation; 3) finance routine, and periodic\n            maintenance, to implement spot maintenance, and major\n            maintenance works by contracts, to increase private\n            participation, including training, equipment, and technical\n            assistance
