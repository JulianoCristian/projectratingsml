Despite the failure in achieving the\n            pedagogical aspects, the success of the educational quality\n            improvement objectives, largely compensated this\n            shortcoming. Improvements were attained in secondary\n            teachers training, coupled with a high degree of approval in\n            textbooks selection. The provision of in-service training\n            workshops, served as a tool to raise the pedagogical skills\n            level, and the project was instrumental in supporting the\n            decentralization of education management, and, successful in\n            strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of\n            Education, Youth and Sports. The major lessons learned\n            indicate that: 1) capacity building, increases resource\n            efficiency, developing expertise within government agencies,\n            and improving the project operation and management; 2)\n            quality measures require the development of baseline and\n            impact indicators for outcome monitoring; it is important to\n            note that same were not included in the project design; 3)\n            the proper coordination of activities among\n            agencies/entities could ensure greater efficiency during\n            project implementation; 4) the curriculum unification,\n            particularly in dual-language instruction systems, should be\n            realistic; thus the project succeeded with common objectives\n            for the short-term; and, 5) stronger donor partnerships\n            should be emphasized, designed to be manageable and ease\n            coordination activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vanuatu - Primary and Secondary Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vanuatu - Primary and Secondary\n            Education
