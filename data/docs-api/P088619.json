to assist the\n            Government in improving living conditions by strengthening\n            the socio economic situation in key urban centers and in two\n            isolated areas i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic\n            services in provincial capitals and key medium urban\n            centers; and (ii) restoring key transport links to reconnect\n            two isolated regions. The project was restructured in 2010\n            and extended for one (1) year to modify the scope and design\n            and allow the completion of the activities. The main reason\n            for the restructuring is to respond to the changing client\n            needs, whereby certain activities are no longer a priority\n            for the Government of DRC, which requested the Bank to focus\n            on a set of key activities under PUSPRES (Projet\n            d'urgence du Soutien au Processus de Reunification\n            Economique et Sociale - Emergency Economic and Social\n            Reunification Project)) that face a financing gap. A\n            recommendation was made during the April 2010 supervision\n            mission to prepare an additional financing to fill the\n            financing gap. The additional financing option could not be\n            pursued because of lack of International Development\n            Association (IDA) funding. Subsequently, other options were\n            explored, and the option of using the ongoing PUAACV (Projet\n            d'urgence d'appui a l'amelioration des\n            conditions de vie -

to assist the\n            Government in improving living conditions by strengthening\n            the socio economic situation in key urban centers and in two\n            isolated areas i.e.: (i) improving delivery of basic\n            services in provincial capitals and key medium urban\n            centers; and (ii) restoring key transport links to reconnect\n            two isolated regions. The project was restructured in 2010\n            and extended for one (1) year to modify the scope and design\n            and allow the completion of the activities. The main reason\n            for the restructuring is to respond to the changing client\n            needs, whereby certain activities are no longer a priority\n            for the Government of DRC, which requested the Bank to focus\n            on a set of key activities under PUSPRES (Projet\n            d'urgence du Soutien au Processus de Reunification\n            Economique et Sociale - Emergency Economic and Social\n            Reunification Project)) that face a financing gap. A\n            recommendation was made during the April 2010 supervision\n            mission to prepare an additional financing to fill the\n            financing gap. The additional financing option could not be\n            pursued because of lack of International Development\n            Association (IDA) funding. Subsequently, other options were\n            explored, and the option of using the ongoing PUAACV (Projet\n            d'urgence d'appui a l'amelioration des\n            conditions de vie -

Emergency\n            Living Conditions Improvement Support Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the\n            Emergency Living Conditions Improvement Support Project for\n            Congo is to assist the Government in improving living\n            conditions by strengthening the socio economic situation in\n            key urban centers and in two isolated areas - i.e.: (i)\n            improving delivery of basic services in provincial capitals\n            and key medium urban centers; and (ii) restoring key\n            transport links to reconnect two isolated regions. The main\n            reason for the restructuring is to modify the scope and\n            design of the project by closing component C, with a current\n            disbursement rate of 92 percent, and component D, which\n            remains undisbursed as most of the activities were financed\n            by the Government and the provinces and the remaining will\n            be financed by the donors.  The unused funds will be\n            reallocated for use under components A and B to ensure that\n            the Project Development Objective (PDO) can be achieved by\n            the new completion date of September 30, 2011. The changes\n            will not have a major effect on the original economic and\n            social aspects of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Emergency Living Conditions Improvement Support Project :\n            restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/07/12744054/congo-democratic-republic-emergency-living-conditions-improvement-support-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"ZR-Emergency Living Conditions Improvement\n            Support Project -- P088619","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Access to Finance,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20100909011205"},"subsc":"General education sector,Power,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector,General public administration sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Energy and mining,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, average travel time, Borrower,\n            cities, construction industry, description, Development\n            Bank, Distribution network, drainage, economic activities,\n            economic development, equipment, expenditure, female,\n            Financial Management, Financial Reports, Habitats, housing,\n            human resource, human resource management, Impact\n            Assessment, Indigenous Peoples, institution, Institutional\n            Support, interurban roads, intervention, latrines, LIVING\n            CONDITIONS, nutrition, O&amp;M, operating costs,\n            passengers, Performance indicators, Policy Framework,\n            Procurement, project management, public finance, public\n            works, quality of services, Reduction in time, Reduction in\n            travel, Resettlement, result, RESULTS, road, road\n            maintenance, road sector, Road traffic, Roads, ROUTES,\n            Sanitation, school facilities, sites, start-up, supervision,\n            targets, transparency, transport, transport infrastructure,\n            transportation, Union, urban areas, vehicles"}},"owner":"Urban Dev. & Services Prac 1 (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"55665"},"facets":{}}}
