Water is treated\n            as a precious commodity in Armenia. It is expensive and not\n            always plentiful or clean enough to meet the needs of the\n            capital's citizens. Neglected for decades, municipal\n            water and wastewater systems leaked, wasted and misused\n            water. As a result, most residents only had water a few\n            hours a day. When water did come out of the tap, it was\n            often unhealthy. Armenia's government has strived over\n            the past decade to improve access to reliable and safe\n            drinking water. Two projects, financed by World Bank funds,\n            have made improvements in water delivery and quality, and\n            customer service. Thanks to the projects, 332,000 households\n            in the capital have running water 21 hours a day, up from\n            six.  Water quality and customer service began to improve\n            after reforms put a private company in charge of managing\n            the utility company. Yerevan's water supply is\n            monitored in real time through a new software program. The\n            entire network of water mains and pipes can be seen on a\n            single computer screen which shows who is receiving water at\n            any given time, and where bottlenecks occur. A customer\n            service hotline answers consumers' questions and\n            responds to emergencies around the clock. People report\n            problems with water quality or meters, and water or sewage\n            main breaks. Over the last ten years, the country has\n            significantly improved the way it manages and protects its\n            water resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"In Armenia - Clean, constant water in Yerevan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"In Armenia - Clean, constant\n            water in Yerevan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/01/25070377/armenia-clean-constant-water-yerevan","count":"Armenia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"wells, water sources, water quality,\n            municipal development, users, wastewater, pumping, drinking\n            water, network, running water, households, safe drinking\n            water, meters, water users, wastewater systems, liters per\n            second, water company, connections, construction, systems,\n            water, water meters, water supply, reservoirs, water mains,\n            installing water meters, utility, pipeline, water losses,\n            pumping stations, municipal water, water consumption, water resources"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management,Rural development","topic":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Water Management Structures m1326743 1000,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Environmental Water Use and Catchment\n            Protection m1326301 157,Water Resources Management m1326089 141","projn":"AM-Yerevan Water & Wastewater Project -- P087641,AM-Municipal Development Project-118621 -- P035805","subtopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Conservation,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0830f07bb_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!82689"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Sewerage,Sanitation,Water supply,General public administration sector,Housing construction,Water supply,Flood protection","theme":"Other financial and private sector development,Natural disaster management,Pollution management and environmental health,Urban services and housing for the poor,Pollution management and environmental health,Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Water resource management","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Water Allocation and Water Economics\n            m1326745 427,Water m1326522 137,Water Management Structures m1326743 1000,Energy and Water m1327476 142,Environmental Water Use and Catchment\n            Protection m1326301 157,Water Resources Management m1326089 141","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF026037-TA CTF FOR KAZAKHSTAN ENVIRONMENT,TF031973-ARMENIA - SOCIAL SECTOR,TF027095-PHRD-MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF029334-PHRD -MUNICIPAL & SOCIAL\n            SECTOR DEV.
