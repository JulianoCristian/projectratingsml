The seven-year\n            project achieved most of its targets and effectively\n            contributed to strengthening the country's human\n            capital base by expanding the availability of trained\n            manpower, thus enhancing productivity and facilitating\n            economic restructuring. However, there was a change in\n            national leadership in 1994, immediately after project\n            effectiveness. The new government decided not to commit to\n            the policy development sub-component of the general\n            education component of the project, scaling down the initial\n            objectives of the project, and thus contributed to the\n            implementation delay. The main lessons learned from this\n            project include: 1) A strong institutional set-up is needed\n            in complex projects. 2) Project design should be as thorough\n            as possible and requires extensive consultation with the\n            stakeholders. 3) Project design should be simplified. 4)\n            Implementation management capacity needs to be strong over\n            the entire project life. 5) Clarity of and expertise in\n            project implementation procedures is required. 6) Clarity\n            and relevance of performance indicators and implementation\n            of an education information system are essential for\n            monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Barbados -

The specific\n            objectives are: (i) to strengthen the quality and efficiency\n            of basic education, with a view to raising student\n            achievement; (ii) to improve the effectiveness, efficiency\n            and responsiveness of technical and vocational education and\n            training (TVET); and (iii) to reinforce employment services\n            and labor market information. To these ends, the project\n            includes the following components: (a) the general education\n            support component aims to reinforce the basic education\n            foundation by improving the quality of services and raising\n            internal efficiency. The project supports the expansion of\n            innovative and cost effective instructional strategies such\n            as multi-grade teaching and school-based training; (b) the\n            TVET development component aims to increase the\n            effectiveness of TVET programs through the provision of key\n            inputs to the learning process and to raise efficiency\n            through increased sharing of facilities, expanded use of\n            program view/evaluation procedures, and introduction of user\n            fees in post-secondary education. Responsiveness would be\n            improved through the introduction of flexible curricula,\n            enhanced capabilities to evaluate performance and to\n            design/implement new programs, provision of incentives to\n            post-secondary institutions to enter into training contracts\n            with industry, and increased accountability of institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Barbados - Human Resources Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Barbados - Human Resources
