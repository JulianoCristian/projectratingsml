To produce development results, the\n            Bank needs to pay attention to the design of the credit, the\n            quality of prior actions, and their relation to the expected\n            outcomes. PRSCs are unlikely to be as effective as\n            investment and sector operations for solving specific sector\n            issues. The PRSCs tended to cover macroeconomic and sector\n            issues in a broad manner, making it difficult to cultivate\n            ownership in the agencies responsible for implementing the\n            program. The assistance is more likely to succeed when the\n            Bank targets specific problems and works their solution with\n            the agencies in charge of executing the program. A program\n            of budget support tends to create a higher permanent level\n            of Government expenditure that may not be sustainable in the\n            medium term. Predictable budget support may create\n            inflexibilities in expenditure, forcing donors to continue\n            their support beyond what is needed and desirable. Uganda\n            exemplifies this situation as the PRSC series grew over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit

     outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, the Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and the borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The findings and implications\n            indicate that Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC2) continued the program initiated under PRSC1,\n            expanded the scope of the program as necessary, and improved\n            the monitoring and evaluation framework. Therefore it\n            provided a basis for future PRSCs. This simplified\n            implementation completion report however, is written after\n            the completion of the series of the three PRSCs. For the\n            future, simplified completion reports should be written\n            immediately after the completion of the program in question\n            in order to have an impact on the design of the next\n            operation. As discussed above, an implementation completion\n            report of the full program has been developed and it\n            discussed findings and implications for the design of future\n            PRSCs in Uganda as well as for PRSCs in other countries.\n            Also, a stocktaking report of the first series of PRSCs has\n            been written and discussed extensively in Uganda. Both of\n            these reports have spurred discussions and have had an\n            impact on the further development of the PRSC program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Second Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit (PRSC2)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Second Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit (PRSC2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5707200/uganda-second-poverty-reduction-support-credit-prsc2","projn":"UG-Poverty Reduction Support Credit II -- P073671","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Poverty Assessment,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,National Governance","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Uganda","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050404104824"},"subsc":"General education sector,Other social services,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General public administration sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"auditing, corruption, Economic Development,\n            effective use, environmental degradation, Expenditures,\n            Fisheries, health sector, household surveys, Human\n            Development, IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT, income,\n            isolation, land resources, laws, livelihoods,\n            Macroeconomics, poverty assessments, Poverty Reduction,\n            productivity, programs, service delivery"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 2 (AFTP2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Poverty Reduction Support Credit"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF021432-UN SPECIAL INITIATIVE FOR AFRICA,TF025924-PHRD-POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT\n            CREDIT II,TF026722-PHRD-UGANDA: POVERTY REDUCTION\n            SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC II),TF028942-COLLABORATION WITH IRELAND AID\n            REGARDING EDUCATION IN AFRICA","repnb":"31762"},"11305658":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/01/11305658/uganda-poverty-reduction-support-credit-prsc","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/01/11305658/uganda-poverty-reduction-support-credit-prsc","new_url":"2004/01/11305658/uganda-poverty-reduction-support-credit-prsc","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/11/04/000334955_20091104043942/Rendered/INDEX/514350WP0UG00P10Box342028B01PUBLIC1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/11/04/000334955_20091104043942/Rendered/PDF/514350WP0UG00P10Box342028B01PUBLIC1.pdf","credit_no":"3696;3510","datestored":"2009-11-04T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            (PRSC) is the World Bank's quick disbursing lending\n            instrument for supporting the poverty reduction efforts of\n            an eligible borrower country. Two annual PRSCs were approved\n            for the Government of Uganda (GOU) in 2001 and 2002. The\n            PRSCs are expected to serve the country's strategy of\n            reducing poverty and improving public service delivery by\n            addressing public sector issues and initiating institutional\n            and policy reform measures. As part of the reform measures,\n            efforts were undertaken to induce transparency and reduce\n            corruption in government proceedings. Public access to\n            government information was improved and social and internal\n            accountability mechanisms were put in place. Simplified\n            versions of the budget and budget performance reports were\n            published for citizen access, public notices on fiscal\n            transfers were posted at service delivery points, and key\n            policy issues were disseminated through the media. Public\n            service delivery was monitored through performance and\n            expenditure tracking surveys. A few policies on citizen\n            participatory mechanisms were also approved. Although\n            progress has been noted in many areas, sectoral reforms may\n            take a long time to materialize and will require a\n            coordinated effort across ministries and departments. An\n            immediate challenge for Uganda is to reduce the population\n            growth rate as it poses a serious threat to\n            poverty-reduction and economic development efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credit

Overall, activities supported by the PRSC II are\n            not expected to result in major adverse, or irreversible,\n            environmental impacts. Biophysical environmental impacts,\n            although thought to be modest given the nature of the\n            activities, can be foreseen at this time only in a generic\n            manner. The environmental impacts of activities in\n            agriculture, education, health, and water and sanitation are\n            expected to be sufficiently addressed by appropriate Ugandan\n            institutions and implementing agencies. National\n            Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) has the mandate to\n            coordinate, monitor, and supervise all environmental\n            activities. The framework for environmental assessment and\n            regulation is based on the National Environment Statue of\n            1995. The more recent Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)\n            Regulations of 1998 define in detail the (EIA) process. A\n            system of EIA and monitoring that identifies adverse\n            environmental impacts is in place. On physical cultural\n            property, the Ugandan EIA system includes a stipulation to\n            prevent destruction of cultural heritages, historic sites,\n            and archaeological
