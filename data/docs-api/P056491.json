The selection\n            of components focused around the life of communities, such\n            as the reconstruction of basic services to support their\n            livelihoods, a relevant, and responsive approach; 3) the\n            flexible procurement methods, such as force account to\n            construct small works, conducive to an effective\n            implementation; 4) the introduction of seismic-resistant\n            construction methods, a key element for sustainability,\n            which included training, and dissemination of these\n            practices; 5) the close consultation with beneficiaries -\n            for both reconstruction, and poverty alleviation components\n            - which ensured project representation in the smallest\n            villages, and a fast implementation; and, 6) the successful\n            economic rehabilitation, attained through the provision of\n            infrastructure reconstruction, reduced vulnerability of\n            local populations, and strengthened social capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Hebei Earthquake Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Hebei

Project. The project's primary objective\n            is to assist in the restoration of economic and social\n            activities following an earthquake in Zhangjiakou\n            Municipality in northwest Hebei province, by restoring\n            social and economic infrastructure and priority production\n            facilities. A second objective is to strengthen the\n            socioeconomic situation in the area through enhancing\n            productive activities, which would alleviate the extreme\n            poverty. The project supports emergency reconstruction,\n            repair, and rehabilitation (and for some components,\n            equipment purchases) of housing; schools; health care\n            facilities; grain storage facilities; drinking water\n            facilities--including distribution networks; water\n            conservancy facilities--a reservoir, wells, buildings,\n            canals, bridges, aqueducts, etc.; and irrigation\n            works--shallow stone wells, dug wells, tube wells, and small\n            sprinkler irrigation systems. An added component provides\n            technical assistance, training, and support to municipal,\n            county, and township level agencies, particularly for\n            building standard
