The lessons\n            learned indicate that given two generation options with\n            nearly equal economic benefits, the operating experience of\n            the implementing agency should be given considerable weight\n            relative to other factors in deciding on the most viable\n            generation option. Prepayment metering can be an effective\n            technical solution to power company billing and collection\n            problems but configuration in line with the tariff structure\n            and loopholes for fraud should be given priority attention\n            in the design of the system. The form of institutional\n            development assistance in a power project should depend on\n            the individual country situation as well as a realistic\n            assessment of what can be achieved during the project's\n            implementation period. In general, standard investment loans\n            are not appropriate lending vehicles to pursue privatization\n            objectives, especially the construction of a large\n            hydropower plant. All hydropower projects with dams, by\n            their very nature, are bound to have a deleterious impact on\n            the environment in some way and assessments should reflect a\n            consensus of Bank and Borrower policies on the amount of\n            damage that is acceptable to meet human needs for electric\n            power. The original Environmental Assessment, undertaken in\n            1991 prior to appraisal, was approved by regional management\n            and subsequently by the Bank's board. In retrospect,\n            the supervision of the Power VI project suffered from the\n            lack of a Bank environmental specialist as a permanent\n            member of the supervision team. The failure to define water\n            rights at an earlier stage of project construction, ideally\n            before construction began, left unresolved the differing\n            water requirements of energy generation for the dam and\n            conservation requirements in the downstream area of the\n            Kihansi gorge. Despite the original assessment of minimal\n            environmental impact, Power VI also took note of a lesson\n            learned at appraisal that continued ecological monitoring\n            during project implementation was important."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Sixth Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Sixth Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2523441/tanzania-sixth-power-project","projn":"TZ-Power VI -- P002756","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Business in Development,Business Environment,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20030929111722"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Power,Oil and gas","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accounting,accounting\n            procedures,accounting systems,accounts,accounts\n            receivable,administrative costs,advertising,AIC,Asset\n            Valuation,audits,autonomy,Bank Performance,bid\n            documents,billing,bills,central planning,climate,commercial\n            operations,cost estimates,decentralization,ecology,economic\n            development,EIB,energy efficiency,Exchange\n            Rate,families,Financial Performance,financial performance\n            indicators,FISCAL YEAR,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,inflation,Institutional Development,inventory,legal\n            framework,LRMC,management information systems,marginal\n            cost,Mines,motivation,Natural Resources,Oil,operating\n            costs,potential investors,private\n            sector,Privatization,Productivity,Reorganization,safety,sales,technical assistance"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accountability,accounting,accounting\n            procedures,accounting systems,accounts,accounts\n            receivable,administrative costs,advertising,AIC,Asset\n            Valuation,audits,autonomy,Bank Performance,bid\n            documents,billing,bills,central planning,climate,commercial\n            operations,cost estimates,decentralization,ecology,economic\n            development,EIB,energy efficiency,Exchange\n            Rate,families,Financial Performance,financial performance\n            indicators,FISCAL YEAR,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,inflation,Institutional Development,inventory,legal\n            framework,LRMC,management information systems,marginal\n            cost,Mines,motivation,Natural Resources,Oil,operating\n            costs,potential investors,private\n            sector,Privatization,Productivity,Reorganization,safety,sales,technical assistance"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020276-POWER VI PROJECT","repnb":"26745"},"4294924":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/08/4294924/tanzania-sixth-power-project-management-response","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1995/08/4294924/tanzania-sixth-power-project-management-response","new_url":"1995/08/4294924/tanzania-sixth-power-project-management-response","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/06/16/000265513_20040616131041/Rendered/INDEX/29263.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2004/06/16/000265513_20040616131041/Rendered/PDF/29263.pdf","credit_no":"2489","datestored":"2004-06-16T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1995-08-16T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Sixth Power Project : Management Response"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Management Response for the Tanzania\n            Sixth Power Project examines the claims made by the\n            Requestors in the Request for Inspection and the results of\n            the Investigation Report.

    from Tannol Holdings, Ltd., states that the International\n            Development Association (IDA) has failed to follow\n            operational policies.  The IDA financed an Emergency Power\n            Project (EEP) in Tanzania and, according to the Requesters,\n            intervened improperly and have caused great financial loss\n            and injury to the Requesters. Since 1992 a consortium of two\n            Canadian companies has been considering a gas field and\n            pipeline project known as the Songo Songo Project. Under the\n            terms of this project, one of the consortium members, Ocelot\n            Energy and Transcanada Pipelines (OTC) would be given 50\n            percent interest in the gas field that is being developed\n            with IDA money. The project was projected to be funded by\n            private funds, but in early 1995 a letter from the Bank to\n            the Tanzania Ministry of Water, Energy and Materials stated\n            that all World Bank aid would be cut off unless the Canadian\n            OTC project with IDA funding was selected. Despite repeated\n            reassurance from the Bank that the matter would be justified\n            or countermanded, the Tanzanian Ministry of Water and Energy\n            announced that the OTC project had been selected. The\n            Requesters claim the IDA failed to follow operational\n            policies and providing funding for a government-owned power\n            plant when a private sector project could have been\n            constructed from private sources. The Requesters also cite\n            the failure to follow environmental assessments used by the\n            Bank because the OTC project will be constructed on an\n            unsound site with no previous environmental assessments and\n            at a cost to public health and safety."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -
