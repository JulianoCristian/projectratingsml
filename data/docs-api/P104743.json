Some lessons learned included: a technical\n            assistance (TA) project designed to assist a country in\n            implementing pensions and SP policy performs best when it\n            follows in-depth analytical work. Despite the original\n            intention of phasing out the temporary pension arrangement\n            after the Maldives retirement pension scheme (MRPS) became\n            operational, the government chose to provide for MRPS while\n            continuing the parallel pension schemes for government\n            employees. Both of these actions were not based on technical\n            analysis. The individual disbursements in a disbursement\n            linked indicators (DLI) based operation may not be large\n            enough to provide enough leverage to encourage the\n            government to undertake what may be politically difficult\n            policy changes. Suspension, while seldom used, can be an\n            effective instrument, even in DLI-based operations, in\n            highlighting the critical importance of abiding by the\n            mutually agreed set of actions and principles as reflected\n            in the negotiated financing agreement between the Bank and governments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Maldives - Pension and Social Protection\n
