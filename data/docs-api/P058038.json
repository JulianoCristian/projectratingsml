Lessons are addressed through several\n            subjects, mainly that sustainable input supply system is\n            possible in the context of Rwanda, under the right set of\n            policies, incentives and institutional mechanisms. Line Of\n            Credit : Given the significant investment of large-scale\n            importers in the input supply business, there is a need to\n            ensure profitability and greater knowledge of inputs on the\n            part of suppliers. Small Farmer Import Credit Facility : The\n            combination of revolving scheme in rural areas, and the\n            targeted training of farmers in the use, and management of\n            credit represents a major break through in terms of access\n            to credit, and modern inputs for farmers. Nonetheless, local\n            leaders need to be sensitized on the management of input\n            credit. Input Credit Insurance Facility: Clear mechanisms,\n            guided by specific criteria should be established to assess\n            the extent of natural disasters damage experienced by\n            farmers, which was not evident in the implementation\n            procedures, whereas resources need to be managed by a\n            competent institution, such as an insurance firm,\n            agricultural banking, or micro-finance institution;\n            Extension System : The lead farmer extension system should\n            be adopted at the national level, and the concept broadened,\n            to be replicated to other sectors for developmental\n            activities. Further subjects address the need for farmers\n            training programs, for seed multiplication and distribution\n            activities, for agricultural technology development and\n            transfer, and, for agricultural marketing poles, and private\n            sector investment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Agricultural and Rural Market\n            Development

The first, promotion\n            of input use and distribution systems, includes farmer\n            access to seasonal credit for modern farm inputs; advisory\n            services for the adoption of modern farm inputs; and access\n            to credit, multiplication, and distribution of improved\n            seeds. The second, support to local agricultural marketing\n            systems, is comprised of crop conservation, processing, and\n            marketing technologies; strengthening of rural agricultural\n            marketing poles; and support to private trader investment in\n            marketing services.
