(b) provision of financial and legal services to\n            assist the Government in negotiations with private investors\n            in the potash sector; and (c) assistance to the Government\n            in the formulation of broad potash development policies. The\n            feasibility study will be executed in two phases, with the\n            second phase carried out only if the first phase is\n            satisfactory. Tests and core drilling work conducted to date\n            indicate a good probability that a viable potash development\n            project will emerge offering significant benefits to the\n            economy by: (a) helping to industrialize a relatively\n            underdeveloped region of the country, generating direct and\n            indirect benefits through provision of infrastructure,\n            services and related employment opportunities; (b)\n            generating foreign exchange revenues which will help\n            alleviate the country's balance of payments; (c)\n            contributing to the Government's fiscal base through\n            royalties and tax payments; and (d) providing the\n            country's agriculture sector with an important input to
