The project would also benefit other Danubian\n            countries, and would become an integral part of the European\n            waterway system when the Rhine-Main-Danube canal is\n            completed in 1984. It would also help accelerate economic\n            development in the relatively poor Dobrogea region through\n            which the canal runs, and provide local irrigation and power benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -
