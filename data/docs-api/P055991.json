Some lessons learned included:\n            support to legal reforms requires a comprehensive risk\n            assessment and constant monitoring of changes and its\n            implications. To increase effectiveness, the single agency\n            model for land administration should focus on the cadastre\n            and registry functions coupled with institutional and fiscal\n            autonomy. Focusing land regularization activities in\n            priority areas, rather than undertaking a systematic land\n            regularization process can increase the impact and\n            sustainability of land administration projects. Strong focus\n            on municipalities is critical to the sustainability of\n            investments on cadastre and registry modernization. Ensuring\n            broad community support for a project requires attention to\n            representativeness and legitimacy of consultation\n            mechanisms. In-house development of technological platforms\n            may provide additional benefits beyond efficiency and\n            transparency. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements of land\n            administration projects need to be considered more carefully\n            during preparation and implementation.

Since the project's board\n            approval, the legal and institutional framework regulating\n            land property rights in Honduras has changed substantially.\n            At the time of project preparation, cadastre administration\n            was under the responsibility of the Borrower's\n            executive branch while the Borrower's judicial branch\n            was responsible for the real estate registry. Therefore, the\n            Ministry of Interior (SGJ) was selected as implementing\n            agency and an agreement between SGJ and the Borrower's\n            judicial branch was established. The property law\n            (congressional decree 82-2004), published in the official\n            gazette on June 29, 2004, established a new legal regime for\n            land administration, and created a new entity, the property\n            institute (IP), to oversee land administration in the\n            country in an integrated manner, including cadastre\n            administration and real estate registry. As a result, the\n            Borrower is now requesting that SGJ be replaced with IP as\n            implementing agency for the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Land Administration Project :\n            restructuring and extension"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras -

Given the relative economic and\n            political vulnerability of the indigenous peoples, the Panel\n            finds that the safeguards provided under the Project are not\n            adequate to protect the Garifuna rights over their Ethnic\n            Lands in the context of Project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras -

Specifically among the complaints, the\n            Requestors note that the project is supposed to provide for\n            ancestral lands to be regularized in favor of indigenous and\n            Afro-Honduran populations by recognizing communal or\n            individual land rights, based on the preference of each\n            community, and by registering such rights in the land\n            registry.

In response\n            to these complaints, Bank Management focuses on four points:\n            1) When activities are implemented, appropriate safeguards\n            are built into the project to protect indigenous\n            people's lands. 2) Community participation in the\n            project is voluntary and broad participatory mechanisms are\n            operational. 3) The project complies with national\n            legislation as well as with Bank policies. 4) Management has\n            responded to the Requestor's concerns and \"remains\n            committed to ongoing meaningful consultations that include\n            Garifuna stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras -

in\n            Spanish, Programa de Administracion de la Tierra-PATH). The\n            Request was submitted by the Organizacion Fraternal Negra\n            Honduras (OFRANEH) on behalf of the indigenous Garifuna\n            population of Honduras. This Request was registered on\n            January 10, 2006. The Requesters state that under the\n            project, ancestral lands are to be regularized in favor of\n            indigenous and Afro-Honduran populations by recognizing\n            communal or individual land rights, based on the preference\n            of each community, and by registering such rights in the\n            land registry. In addition, they note that properties and\n            possessions supported by ancestral title or certification\n            can be registered as private property and enjoy full\n            ownership rights. However, the Requesters fear that the land\n            titling and procedures provided under the Project will\n            ultimately cause the demise of collective property in favor\n            of individual property, which is contrary to the land tenure\n            system they prefer, and could give their land, which they\n            consider as their functional habitat, to people outside the\n            Garifuna communities. The Requesters claim: 1) in designing\n            and implementing the Project, the Bank did not take into\n            account the rights and interests of the Garifuna communities\n            and, as a result, violated a number of its policies and\n            procedures, such as OD 4.20 on Indigenous People, OP/BP 4.01\n            on Environmental Assessment and OP/BP 4.04 on Natural\n            Habitats; 2) the Bank did not consider the legal status of\n            the indigenous populations or the procedures to issue\n            collective titles, as provided in the country's\n            Constitution and legislation; 3) while the IPDP provides for\n            issuing regulations to delimit and demarcate indigenous\n            peoples' lands, these were never is sued; 4) the Bank\n            staff did not consult with affected people prior to\n            preparing the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP),\n            and did not distribute Project background material; 5)\n            although Bank staff were aware during project preparation\n            that the Government was to enact a Property Law, to be the\n            centerpiece of the land titling program, they did not\n            mention this law in the legal framework section of the\n            Project documents. Moreover, the Garifuna people opposed\n            this law. The failure to reference the Property Law and the\n            lack of consultation meetings with the affected people have\n            generated confusion within the Garifuna communities, because\n            the Project documents, including the IPDP, on the one side,\n            and the Property Law on the other, provide for two different\n            sets of procedures for land titling and conflict resolution.\n            And in any event, both sets of procedures are inadequate\n            because they do not respond to their social and political reality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras

aims at an integrated, and\n            decentralized land administration system (comprising public\n            and private entities) to provide users accurate information\n            on urban, and rural land parcels, and effective land\n            administration services (purchase, mortgages, cadastral and\n            registry certifications, etc.) in a timely and\n            cost-effective manner. The system will help increase land\n            tenure security, facilitate land market transactions,\n            develop national and municipal territorial plans, and\n            develop management plans for protected areas, forests, and\n            indigenous peoples lands. The main objective of the first\n            component shall be the establishment of a National Property\n            Administration System (SINAP), through strengthened legal,\n            regulatory, and institutional frameworks. SINAP will include\n            a National Territorial Information System (SINIT), a\n            Registry of Norms (RENOT), and the Unified Registries System\n            (SURE), which will be operated by public and private\n            entities. Activities under the second component will benefit\n            local populations, through massive regularization and\n            registration of an essential asset: land. The project aims\n            to cover different types of rural and urban land, and a\n            diverse cross-section of Honduran society, including the\n            rich and the poor, men and women, ladino, indigenous, and\n            Afro-Honduran. The main output will be to incorporate land\n            parcels within the project area into SINAP, while the\n            project will finance pre-field work, such as aerial\n            photography, field surveying of macro boundaries such as\n            inter-municipal boundaries, parcel-level surveying and\n            validation, conflict resolution, titling, and mass\n            registration into SINAP. Finally, the third component covers\n            the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) administration costs,\n            specifically to implement monitoring and evaluation activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras -
