The\n            Agricultural Rehabilitation Project had the following\n            ratings: moderately satisfactory outcome, unlikely\n            sustainability, modest institutional development impact,\n            satisfactory Bank performance, and not rated Grantee\n            performance.  The Second Agricultural Rehabilitation Project\n            had the following ratings: moderately unsatisfactory\n            outcome, unlikely sustainability, modest institutional\n            development impact, unsatisfactory Bank performance, and\n            satisfactory Grantee performance. Experience with these\n            projects highlights the following lessons: 1) With its\n            global outreach and the expertise and experience of its\n            staff the Bank is well positioned to make a substantial\n            contribution to post-conflict reconstruction and\n            development.  However, the experience of the three community\n            empowerment and the two agriculture rehabilitation projects\n            shows that careful thought to suitability of design and\n            strategies to country conditions is paramount, especially\n            where country capacity is weak; 2) even in the case of\n            post-conflict Timor-Leste, where sophisticated monitoring\n            and evaluation was impractical, there was a need to have a\n            system to track project inputs, outputs, and outcomes and\n            provide information about the adaptations needed in project\n            design to ensure that the project objectives and activities\n            are in keeping with the emerging institutional context and\n            the absorptive capacity of the country; 3) particularly in\n            post-conflict environments, an approach to capacity building\n            that considers the underlying capacity in the country as\n            well as how it would be promoted by the various donors is\n            critical; and 4) the experience of Timor-Leste highlights\n            the critical importance of coordinating multi-agency\n            reconstruction efforts more effectively in a newly\n            independent post-conflict country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste -

Through the\n            provision of small grants, community proposals will be\n            funded against in-kind labor, and materials. Training to\n            farmers will include applied technical, and participatory\n            methods, as well as monitoring and evaluation of projects;\n            2) increase agricultural production in irrigated areas, by\n            financing the rehabilitation, and maintenance works on\n            community-based irrigation schemes, farm-to-market access\n            roads, including larger damaged irrigation schemes.

Development and Natural Resources Management component\n            involves activities which are small in scale, and therefore\n            the environmental impact in the short term is not expected\n            to be significant. The Rapid Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            component will support community irrigation rehabilitation.\n            Such activity may generate dust, local turbidity of\n            watercourses, and localized downstream erosion arising from\n            river diversion. Also under this component, civil work\n            activities will be employed in the rehabilitation of a total\n            of 7 medium-scale irrigation schemes. The works will include\n            the rehabilitation of main structures and canals, as well as\n            secondary and tertiary canals that would provide irrigation\n            to an estimated 1,500 hectares. The highest rating for the\n            potential environmental impact of the irrigation scheme\n            rehabilitation is moderate in intensity and medium-term in\n            persistence, and the impacts occur mainly during the\n            construction phase of the activity. The operational phase of\n            the irrigation scheme is not expected to produce significant\n            negative environmental impact.
