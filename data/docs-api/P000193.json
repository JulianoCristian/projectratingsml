The execution of the project's investment\n            component suffered initial start-up delays, associated with\n            management weaknesses and the slow recruitment of technical\n            assistance staff. The Bank can be faulted for designing a\n            complex hybrid operation which was difficult to implement\n            given the limited implementation capacity. The overall\n            project outcome is unsatisfactory because the main\n            objectives of strengthening Ministry of Agriculture and\n            Livestock (MOAL)'s analytical, programming, budgeting\n            and monitoring capability and improving agricultural\n            research and services were only partially achieved. Some of\n            the key lessons learnt from this operation include: (a)\n            project design should be kept simple and tailored to the\n            Borrower's absorptive and implementation capacity, with\n            objectives, components and activities prioritized and\n            focused; (b) technical assistance components and activities,\n            where necessary, should be carefully designed and monitored,\n            taking into account Borrower's ability for effective\n            management and utilization as well as the over-riding\n            requirement for transfer of skills, capacity building and\n            training; (c) project coordination arrangements operating\n            outside of the public service structure, limited to overall\n            coordination, facilitation and management, may be necessary\n            in some instances to facilitate effective project execution;\n            (d) the establishment of effective accounting and financial\n            management systems as well as the Borrower's\n            internalization of Bank's operating procedures are\n            necessary prerequisites for project implementation, and\n            should receive early attention; (e) attractive salary and\n            incentive structures should be established within the\n            context of overall civil service reforms, to attract and\n            retain high quality staff for project execution; and (f)\n            socio-political instability, conflict, and adverse political\n            and security conditions have an overriding impact on project\n            outcomes, and should be factored into project design and\n            supervision to the degree possible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Agricultural Services
