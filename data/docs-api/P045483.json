Sixteen of these projects were processed as\n            'emergency' operations, one of which is the\n            subject of this evaluation The only previous OED report on\n            the country to date is a case study of post- conflict\n            reconstruction, published in 2000, but based on fieldwork\n            carried out in 1997. The Emergency Electric Power\n            Reconstruction Project has had a highly satisfactory overall\n            outcome. Project sustainability is assessed as likely, while\n            the institutional development impact was substantial. Bank\n            and borrower performance during the project are rated as\n            highly satisfactory because rapid and efficient\n            implementation by both the Bank and borrower staff meant\n            that the project was completed and fully disbursed only\n            three years from identification. The outcome of the Second\n            Electric Power Reconstruction Project is rated as\n            satisfactory and the project's sustainability as\n            likely. The institutional development impact of the project\n            is rated as substantial, because of the progress recorded in\n            bringing staff from the three utilities to work together on\n            common is- sues, especially power trading, and in raising\n            awareness of the importance of the environ- mental aspects\n            of power generation. Bank and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The key finding from these projects is that\n            when electricity supply cannot be organized in a manner that\n            is technically and economically optimal, there are high\n            costs to a country in terms of lost efficiency and economies\n            of scale. The project experience offers two lessons: 1)\n            Power sector restructuring in a heavily coal-based power\n            system cannot be delinked from reform of the coal industry\n            because of the predominance of coal in the cost of producing\n            electricity from it. Reforms in both sectors should be\n            addressed in parallel, or preferably coal sector reforms\n            should precede electricity, but not lag behind. 2)\n            Experience with tariff increases and improved revenue\n            collection in the immediate aftermath of the peace accord\n            shows that consumers are willing to contribute to the cost\n            of the rapid restoration of electricity supply."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory overall. Lessons\n            learned consisted of the following: Too many contracts lead\n            to an excessive supervision workload. Three governments,\n            three implementing agencies, and many parallel financiers\n            also lead to a large preparation and supervision workload.\n            In this case, the number of parallel financiers enlisted\n            under the project proved cumbersome, given the very variable\n            levels of commitment and supervision of parallel financed\n            components. Lastly, where there are multiple sector\n            institutions with diverse, and sometimes conflicting,\n            interests and priorities, the establishment of formal\n            structures for collaboration, such as the Joint Power\n            Coordination Center, can contribute significantly to greater\n            cooperation and harmony between the various institutions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -
