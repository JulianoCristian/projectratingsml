The Bali Urban\n            Infrastructure Project also had a moderately satisfactory\n            outcome but its institutional development impact is\n            substantial. The Municipal Innovations Project had a\n            satisfactory outcome with modest institutional development\n            impact. All three projects have unlikely sustainability. The\n            performances of the Bank and the Borrower for all three\n            projects were satisfactory.  Experience with the three\n            projects suggests the following lessons: 1) Local\n            governments should continue to build upon their demonstrated\n            capacity to improve infrastructure delivery, but need to be\n            more responsive to urban development needs expressed through\n            local community participation. 2) A cross-sector framework,\n            such as the Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development\n            Program (IUIDP), can work well for local governments,\n            provided the investment resources within it are sufficiently\n            concentrated to adequately address needs in all included\n            sectors. 3) All stakeholders, including local governments\n            themselves, need to agree and clearly understand the purpose\n            behind local innovations - be it to increase efficiency, to\n            increase client-responsiveness. 4) The Bank should ensure\n            that local governments are always included as partners, as\n            it continues to emphasize improving their performance in\n            service delivery. 5) Monitoring and Evaluation systems need\n            to be designed and implemented to track outcomes related to\n            project objectives, as well as the inputs and outputs of\n            project activities that will help achieve these outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

High quality at entry, strong client\n            commitment (especially at provincial and local levels), and\n            dedicated supervision from a field based Bank team enabled\n            the project to be implemented in a satisfactory manner,\n            despite the multi-layered crisis that affected Indonesia\n            from late 1997.

Possible negative impacts and their\n            mitigation measures include: a) water demand increase\n            combined with an irrigation conflict, reduced groundwater\n            level, runoff possibilities, and increased waste water\n            amount - mitigated by reduced water speed, prompt\n            replantation, infiltration ditches or settlement basins,\n            careful water source and intake location selection,\n            underground water transport piping placed parallel to roads,\n            and sludge disposal at final site to avoid river\n            contamination; b) soil erosion and pollution - mitigated by\n            replanting and separate collection of clippings from dry\n            waste; c) resettlement of populace - mitigated by a\n            resettlement plan; d) noise and disturbance - mitigated by\n            locating markets away from densely populated areas and sound\n            barrier construction; e) reduced safety in rural areas;\n            mitigated by provision of safe crossings, signaling, and\n            speed limits; f) air quality, pollution and increased odor -\n            mitigated by use of vegetation to filter dust, seal dirt\n            access roads, use of closed sanitation treatment process,\n            closed garbage vans, and dump coverage, centralized\n            incineration and green zone creation;
