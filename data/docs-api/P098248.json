Climate change adaptation\n            requires extensive bottom-up work and community development.\n            The ability of countries to increase their climate change\n            resilience is directly linked to their capacity to generate\n            and analyze data to assess vulnerability.

Good progress has\n            been achieved overall in the generation of scientific\n            knowledge and capacity strengthening on climate change and\n            glacier monitoring. Climate change scenarios have been\n            generated in Peru and Ecuador, and are being elaborated in\n            Bolivia, and models have been developed to assess impacts on\n            the water and agricultural sectors in selected areas of the\n            participating countries. The Mid Term Review (MTR) of the\n            project identified the need to restructure the project. This\n            paper presents the restructuring, which entails: (i)\n            creation of the regional knowledge sharing among the\n            Beneficiaries (Plurinational State of Bolivia, Republic of\n            Ecuador, and Republic of Peru); (ii) reorganization of\n            project components, (iii) adjustment of some pilot\n            adaptation measures, without changing the objective; (iv)\n            adjustment of the results framework; (v) reallocation of\n            proceeds to fit the revised project structure; and (vi)\n            updating the project cost estimates and financing plan. A\n            work plan outlining the activities to be completed by\n            project closure has been agreed upon by the implementing\n            agency and the beneficiaries. The changes do not affect the\n            scope of the project or it's Project Development\n            Objective (PDO). They are intended to better reflect the\n            nature of the project, which is innovative and unique in\n            many aspects. It is not a traditional infrastructure or\n            agriculture or water project, although it involves all those\n            sectors. As such, the importance of the whole process\n            carried out throughout the life of the Project is being stressed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Andean Countries - Adaptation to\n            the Impact of Rapid Glacier Retreat in the Tropical Andes\n            Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/08/15961788/andean-countries-adaptation-impact-rapid-glacier-retreat-tropical-andes-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"6A-Adaptation To The Impact Of Rapid Glacier\n            Retreat In The Tropic -- P098248","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Wetlands,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry,Water Supply and Systems","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Andean Countries","entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120322004954"},"subsc":"Forestry,Water supply,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General public administration sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adaptive management, aerial photographs,\n            agricultural practices, agricultural production,\n            agriculture, agriculture production, atmospheric carbon,\n            availability of water, basins, Bilateral Agencies, canals,\n            capacity building, catchment, catchment level, Catchment\n            Management, Catchment Management Plan, civil works, CLIMATE,\n            CLIMATE CHANGE, community leaders, Conservation,\n            construction, crops, demand management, distribution\n            systems, drinking water, drinking water supply, ecosystems,\n            environmental impacts, Environmental Management, floods,\n            food security, forestry, glaciers, global warming,\n            grasslands, hydrological regime, hydrology, images, improved\n            food security, integrated water management, irrigation,\n            irrigation canals, land tenure, land tenure issues,\n            management of water, meteorological data, meteorological\n            services, meteorological stations, mitigation, monitoring\n            activities, Municipal Government, municipalities, potable\n            water, pressure, project management, Public Water, Public\n            Water Supply, regional government, remote sensing,\n            restoration, river, river basin, river basins, riverine,\n            runoff, rural communities, Sanitation, satellite images,\n            Soil Conservation, sources of water, storage capacity,\n            sustainable use, underground water, use of water, water\n            authority, water availability, water consumption, water\n            distribution, water distribution system, Water distribution\n            systems, water losses, water management, water management\n            authorities, water regulation, water resource, water\n            resource management, water resources, water resources\n            management, water resources management plans, water\n            resources planning, water retention, water sources, water\n            storage, water supply system, water system, water usage,\n            water use, water users, water utility, water wells, waters,\n            watershed, Watershed Management, Watersheds, wells, wetlands"}},"owner":"Environment (LCSEN)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF056694-GEF PDF B-REGIONAL DESIGN AND\n            IMPLEMENTATION OF PILOT CLIMATE CHANGE AD,TF090328-PHRD PERU: ADAPTATION TO RAPID\n            GLACIER RETREAT IN THE TROPICAL ANDES (B,TF091497-GFDRR:BOLIVIA:MAINSTREAMING\n            ADAPTIVE RIVER DEFENSE FOR HUAYHUASI & EL P,TF091712-GEF FSP:ADAPTATION TO THE\n            IMPACT OF RAPID GLACIER RETREAT IN THE TROPIC","repnb":"63456"},"facets":{}}}
