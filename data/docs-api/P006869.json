Successive ICBF directors generally\n            agreed, for example, to mount an impact evaluation, but\n            never followed through to complete its design. Toward the\n            end of the Project, ICBF interest in and commitment to the\n            Project began to increase, and planned activities were\n            completed. Some of the lessons learned from the project are\n            as follows: 1) understanding both the political and\n            institutional climate has important implications for the\n            immediate impact of the project and sustainable outcomes.\n            Projects such as this one that involve different\n            participating institutions to support the achievement of\n            Project objectives should establish agreements with\n            authorities or institutions, and provision should be made\n            for periodic review/revision /ratification of institutional\n            arrangements or agreements throughout implementation. This\n            is especially germane in the case of first time projects in\n            sectors with weak or nonexistent institutional linkages at\n            project inception; and 2) the scale and location of projects\n            has a direct bearing on whether government agencies or\n            non-government organization (NGOs) are better positioned to\n            achieve optimal project results. Centralized procedures,\n            characteristic of the older operations supported by the Bank\n            and the Colombian Government, were poorly suited to a highly\n            decentralized and participatory service delivery model such\n            as the Child Care Homes Program (HBIs). In this case, the\n            involvement of NGOs might have led to a greater project impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Community Child Care and\n            Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia -

reduction program and aims to strengthen an ongoing program\n            of home based child care. The basic objectives are as\n            follows : a) improve the cost effectiveness of the Colombian\n            Institute of Family Welfare ( ICBF ) operations; b) support\n            the institutional development of ICBF; and c) evaluate,\n            improve and maintain the quality of home based child care (\n            HBI ). The project will finance the main investment costs of\n            the HBI expansion during 1990/95. It will consist of the\n            following components : 1) policy development - i) enhancing\n            the effectiveness of ICBF resource use by establishing\n            revised financing arrangements for the CAIPs and reducing\n            the ICBF's budget contribution to the program and ii)\n            improving the production efficiency of Bienestarina ( an\n            important food supplement ); 2) management development -\n            strengthening the management capacity of ICBF in a number of\n            areas, including implementing monitoring and impact\n            evaluation systems for the HBIs on a national scale; and 3)\n            service support - through assistance in consolidating gains\n            of the HBI program; improving quality through introduction\n            of systematic training for community mothers and other HBI\n            participants; and by providing access to home improvement\n            credits to community mothers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Community Child Care and\n            Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Community Child Care\n            and Nutrition Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/05/739235/colombia-community-child-care-nutrition-project","projn":"CO-Comm Child Care & Nu -- P006869","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Health Economics & Finance,Poverty Assessment,Health Systems Development & Reform,Primary Education","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928092912"},"subsc":"(Historic)Targeted health","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aged,asbestos,basic health services,Care\n            Centers,Child Care,community participation,Currency Unit,day\n            care,deaths,direct impact,early childhood development,early\n            childhood education,economic growth,education,education\n            services,employment,foreign exchange,girls,growth\n            rate,health,health services,health status,health\n            system,household survey,income,Institutional\n            Assessment,institutional\n            development,interventions,Iron,learning,living\n            conditions,marketing,mortality,mothers,national\n            scale,non-governmental\n            organizations,Nutrition,parents,policy analysis,Policy\n            Development,Poverty Alleviation,primary education,primary\n            school,public health,Rehabilitation,safety,sanitary\n            conditions,service delivery,severe poverty,social\n            sectors,technical assistance,technical support,urban\n            households,violence,vulnerable groups,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"aged,asbestos,basic health services,Care\n            Centers,Child Care,community participation,Currency Unit,day\n            care,deaths,direct impact,early childhood development,early\n            childhood education,economic growth,education,education\n            services,employment,foreign exchange,girls,growth\n            rate,health,health services,health status,health\n            system,household survey,income,Institutional\n            Assessment,institutional\n            development,interventions,Iron,learning,living\n            conditions,marketing,mortality,mothers,national\n            scale,non-governmental\n            organizations,Nutrition,parents,policy analysis,Policy\n            Development,Poverty Alleviation,primary education,primary\n            school,public health,Rehabilitation,safety,sanitary\n            conditions,service delivery,severe poverty,social\n            sectors,technical assistance,technical support,urban\n            households,violence,vulnerable groups,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela CMU (LCC4C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"P5171"},"facets":{}}}
