Some lessons learned included: in an unstable\n            setting such as in Somalia, where normal trading is\n            disrupted, it is important to base emergency recovery and\n            rehabilitation programs on the production of traditional\n            crops. These crops substituted for imported foods in the\n            local markets thus reducing the impact of soaring global\n            food prices on consumers. There is much to be gained by\n            designing project activities that build upon ongoing\n            programs, as this allows the utilization of knowledge\n            accumulated over time by staff of different organizations,\n            local communities and the private sector. This, in turn,\n            leads to expeditious planning and implementation of project\n            activities, especially of repeater programs; reduced costs\n            of planning; and smooth implementation of activities due to\n            well established relationships with the local authorities,\n            communities and project beneficiaries. Involving the\n            communities in the identification of target beneficiaries\n            (e.g. resource-poor farmers and women headed households) has\n            enabled the project to

Response (FPCR) Trust Fund\n            (TF) to support a Rapid Response Rehabilitation of Rural\n            Livelihoods Project (RRRRLP) in Somalia. The objectives of\n            the GFRP are to: (i) reduce the negative impact of high and\n            volatile food prices on the lives of the poor in a timely\n            way; (ii) support governments in the design of sustainable\n            policies that mitigate the adverse impacts of high and more\n            volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the\n            creation of long-term market distortions; and (iii) support\n            broad-based growth in productivity and market participation\n            in agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food\n            supply response. The worsening food crisis in Somalia points\n            to an urgent need for increased financial support and the\n            World Bank can best assist by financing funding gaps in\n            existing programs being implemented by international,\n            national, and non-governmental institutions. This approach\n            would enable rapid implementation and greatest impact.  The\n            grant will be made to the Food and Agriculture Organization\n            of the United Nations (FAO) as the implementing agency. FAO\n            is currently involved in numerous projects in Somalia, and\n            has an extensive knowledge of the situation on the ground\n            and capacity to coordinate and implement in an efficient and\n            effective manner.
