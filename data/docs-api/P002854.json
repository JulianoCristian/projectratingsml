The main objectives of PEDP were to: (i)\n            promote economic growth and increase employment through\n            policy changes, technical assistance and financial\n            mechanisms for enhancing private enterprises, with special\n            attention to SMEs and the artisanal sector; and (ii) reduce\n            the role of the Government in the productive sectors through\n            technical assistance to assist in the government's\n            ongoing program of parastatal enterprise privatization.\n            Bank's performance was satisfactory. Borrower's\n            performance was deficient. The key lessons learned were as\n            follows: (i) any follow-up project for private enterprise\n            development should include a detailed private sector\n            assessment, coordination of its program with those of other\n            donors, and the full commitment of the Government to both\n            its objectives and its design; (ii) commercial banks and\n            professional associations of enterprises should take the\n            leadership role in any institutional structure developed for\n            private investmnent promotion; (iii) the relationship\n            between IDA and the Borrower should be dynamic and flexible\n            keeping communication channels open, to allow for project\n            changes in the case where the original design does not work\n            well in practice, or is overtaken by events; (iv) the design\n            of a line of credit to commercial banks should be as simple\n            as possible avoiding layers of approval that are not\n            absolutely necessary and may very well deter the interest of\n            investment enterprises and commercial banks; and (v) it is\n            important to find appropriate modalities for providing\n            viable institutional support to the informal sector, which\n            can potentially constitute a dynamic and productive segment\n            of the economy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Private Enterprise Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Togo - Private Enterprise\n            Development
