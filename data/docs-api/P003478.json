There are increases in graduate students\n            trained at high levels of quality, enhanced capacity for\n            such training in the future, and impressive research results\n            emanating from the project. Laboratory management has\n            improved and more effective technology transfer strategies\n            are beginning. Overall, the project significantly\n            contributed to Chinese research and advanced education\n            capacities and to the modernization of thinking about\n            research, education, and laboratory equipment. Key lessons\n            learned from this project include: It is possible to\n            accelerate China's scientific and technological\n            development with appropriate resources and careful planning,\n            and by training more graduate students at international\n            levels of proficiency. It is difficult to transfer\n            managerial experience acquired in other countries to China.\n            Scarcity of equipment made the community maximize the amount\n            of new equipment purchased, at the expense of acquiring\n            adequate supplies of spare parts and consumables for the\n            proper operation of that equipment. The sharing of major\n            facilities at research and teaching institutions is hampered\n            by the compartmentalized organizational structure within the\n            science and technology community. Disseminating managerial\n            know-how within and among laboratories is slow; more\n            efficient means should have been adopted from the beginning.\n            The Programme Advisory Group should have adopted a role akin\n            to that of a managerial Principal Investigator."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Key Studies Development
