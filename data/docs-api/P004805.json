The lessons learned indicate that the use of\n            local processing staff based in the Bank's field office\n            is an advantage for projects which require frequent\n            monitoring and evaluation. A clear orientation to the\n            project objectives and a statement of project\n            responsibilities should be provided to all participants in a\n            project. Project designs should include planned activities\n            to quickly collect and organize good baseline data. When\n            co-financed projects are associated with a Bank project, it\n            is important to have clear understandings and\n            linkages/relationships well documented for both projects.\n            Where faculties have similar or related academic interests,\n            careful attention should be given to options for integration\n            and sharing of equipment and other resources. Future\n            projects should not assume that there is good communication\n            within its stakeholder organizations and should evaluate and\n            work with these organizations to ensure all interested\n            parties can participate in information flows.

Specifically, the project aims to: a) strengthen\n            faculty teaching capabilities; b) upgrade the existing\n            science and engineering program content and broaden the\n            range of programs relevant to Thailand's technological\n            advancement; c) modernize laboratories and strengthen their\n            management; and d) improve resource utilization in\n            engineering and science faculties and establish a system for\n            large-scale equipment procurement.  The project will support\n            quality improvement in public universities through financing\n            an institutional development program which will include: a)\n            short term overseas training for selected academic and\n            technical support staff in the educational use and\n            maintenance of the project-financed equipment; and b)\n            technical assistance and academic support services which\n            will provide consultant services to evaluate existing\n            programs and recommend new ones, improve the program\n            resource management, develop effective procedures for large\n            scale equipment procurement and strengthen project\n            management.  This component will also include small-scale\n            research projects financing for academic and technical staff\n            selected for overseas training.
