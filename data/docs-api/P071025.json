Some lessons learned\n            included:  An important finding from this three-project\n            assessment is the comprehensive and innovative approach used\n            by International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\n            (IBRD) to support existing government health reform\n            programs. Reforms included institution building, legal\n            changes, reorganization of the care process, training of\n            medical and administrative staff, modification of financial\n            incentive framework, data collection and analysis, audits of\n            performance data, and regular feed-back of results to\n            government units and providers. Both countries aimed to\n            improve health outcomes and system performance with the\n            reforms. While the peer-reviewed literature identified\n            various factors that have contributed to decreasing infant\n            mortality rates in addition to improved access to family\n            medicine; both countries made substantial progress in\n            advancing the health reforms. Modifying the incentive\n            framework required upfront investment in data collection and\n            analysis. In both countries IBRD disbursed earmarked health\n            funds tied to tangible results to the government to target\n            existing health reform programs.

(APL) for Provincial Maternal-Child Health\n            Investment Project for Argentina were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the program\n            has created incentives that encouraged each level of the\n            health care system to take steps to improve coverage,\n            quality, and results. The degree to which provincial project\n            executing units (PEUs) have been incorporated within\n            provincial bureaucracies depends on whether provincial\n            health authorities see the plan as a national program or an\n            instrument to conduct their own health policies. Monitoring\n            and evaluation (M and E) instruments cannot be incidental,\n            particularly with projects that have output-based\n            disbursements. The project required intense policy dialog\n            and technical supervision by the Bank, throughout\n            implementation. The possibility of reviewing and adjusting\n            the enrollment and tracer's goals annually allowed the\n            project to set the right incentives to meet the targets\n            considering the real institutional capacities of different\n            provinces. As the flexible approach also envisioned changes\n            in the benefit package, the Government of Argentina (GOA)\n            was able to include new health interventions to cover the\n            needs that arose from changes in health conditions of the\n            target population. The plan provides the opportunity to\n            develop management tools at the national level that can be\n            applied in the provinces to support the program's\n            implementation, thus capitalizing on potential economies of\n            scale and easing the institutional burden on provinces that\n            use them. As the plan continues, it will be crucial to\n            develop a sound institutional framework for these databases,\n            minimizing the risk of illegitimate uses of the information."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - First Phase of Adaptable Program\n            Loan for Provincial Maternal-Child Health Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - First Phase of\n            Adaptable Program Loan for Provincial Maternal-Child Health\n            Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/01/18309810/argentina-first-phase-adaptable-program-loan-provincial-maternal-child-health-investment-project","projn":"AR-Provincial Maternal-Child Health\n            Investment Project  (1st.

The first Adaptable\n            Program Lending (APL) would cover the nine poorest provinces\n            of the NOA and NEA. By the end of loan implementation of\n            APLl (5th project year), 80 percent of the targeted\n            population would be covered and served by the Maternal and\n            Child Health Insurance Program (MCHIP) (more than 600,000\n            beneficiaries). Lastly, the project would contribute to\n            improving the national-provincial health policy dialogue and\n            policy integration, reducing the extreme policy\n            fragmentation that characterizes Argentina's health\n            sector in the last 30 years. Achieving all 3 objectives\n            above would allow the national-provincial policy dialogue to\n            shift away from focusing on inputs and center on output and\n            increasingly on outcomes.  This Indigenous Peoples Plan\n            (IPP) consists of three parts: Social evaluation;\n            consultation process; and Matrix shares with Indigenous\n            Peoples Plan which is the schedule of activities and\n            specific actions to be carried out in the period indicated\n            for consensual with indigenous communities during the\n            consultation and aims to bring together and strengthen the\n            inclusion of indigenous communities to the project.
