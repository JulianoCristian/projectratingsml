Some lessons\n            learned included: complex regional projects require\n            particular support and scrutiny to ensure quality at entry\n            and subsequent implementation success. Measuring behavioral\n            change outcomes related to cross-border and mobile\n            populations (CBMPs) interventions is challenging and may not\n            be advisable. Careful reporting of appropriate baselines,\n            targets, and actual values, is critical to monitor project\n            progress and determine project success. Implementation\n            arrangements should be kept as simple as possible.\n            Implementation agencies should be carefully selected to\n            minimize problems. Service delivery institutions invested\n            into should be accessible to the population being targeted.\n            Future projects targeting CBMPs should consider targeting\n            HIV and AIDS services at select hot spots and broaden\n            support strategies beyond HIV and AIDS.
