The lessons learned indicate that active\n            participation of local communities in the identification,\n            design and implementation of micro-projects as well as\n            cost-sharing arrangements with local communities increases\n            the sense of community ownership and provides a good base\n            for sustainability of Social Fund financed projects. Not\n            subsidizing credit but improving access of the poor to\n            already existing financial services is important. The pilot\n            project allowed the Government and Bank teams to identify\n            bottlenecks, refine the sub-project cycle and improve the\n            institutional set-up. The Social Fund experience showed that\n            the capacity building component can deliver better results\n            if it precedes other components. While NGOs assistance to\n            weak communities is a strength, a high cost of such\n            intermediation reduces the number of communities eventually\n            served. In a country at early stages of decentralization,\n            like in Benin, setting up regional offices, while increasing\n            overhead costs was nevertheless effective at strengthening\n            local consultation processes with weak local governments and\n            deconcentrated services of line ministries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Social Fund
