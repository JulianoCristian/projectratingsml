The principal objective of\n            the Economic Management Project (EMP) was to strengthen the\n            core ministries responsible for managing the country's\n            economy and for implementing the structural adjustment\n            program. Objectives were also to upgrade technical skills of\n            local staff, inter alia, through promotion of on-the-job\n            training. Institutional objectives were partially met.\n            Overall, the Bank's performance was uneven.\n            Identification correctly focused upon the need for the\n            Administration to put in place procedures and systems and\n            staff trained to manage them. Preparation was deficient.\n            Overall Borrower performance was mostly deficient. Lessons\n            learned included: When the Economic Management Project was\n            prepared, it was expected that a solution to the political\n            situation was imminent. Even under this assumption, which\n            did not materialize, project design was over-ambitious and\n            unwieldy for the weak CAR administration. Lessons learned\n            for the Bank are to design the project to fit both country\n            realities and Borrower capacity. A third lesson is to ensure\n            that project objectives are consistent with instruments,\n            since long-term institution-building objectives cannot be\n            matched to a short-term lending operation. A fourth lesson\n            is that continuity in Bank management is essential to ensure\n            responsibility on the Bank side."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Economic\n
