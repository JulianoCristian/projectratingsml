Some lessons learned included:\n            realism in project design should be reflected by the\n            project's complete assessment of all the local\n            realities on the ground during project preparation. In the\n            case of the current project, this should have translated\n            into evidence of adequate completion of preparation work for\n            land acquisition and detailed estimates of engineering\n            designs; preparation of bidding documents for the first year\n            prepared by the borrower. The construction of wastewater\n            treatment facilities cannot be fully implemented in five\n            years. Institutional strengthening has focused on capacity\n            building and training which was very important for the\n            project. However, although sector coordination was\n            recognized as a possible problem area at the time of project\n            preparation/appraisal, it was not given due consideration.\n            Coordination among the various stakeholders should be seen\n            as an aspect of institutional development and an important\n            determinant for project results. There is also a need to\n            identify indicators that can monitor variables that can be\n            directly attributed to the project. The working ratio is not\n            always the most appropriate indicator for financial\n            sustainability as there are many external factors that\n            affect it such as cost of materials (steel, cement and\n            others) and energy. A utility could be improving certain\n            efficiencies but strong increases in market prices will\n            affect the expenses considerably."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Northern Cities

The project seeks\n            to enhance environmental and health conditions, and its\n            development objectives further include improvement in the\n            quality of life, and poverty alleviation; increased coverage\n            of sanitation services, and, implementation of a pilot\n            program to include hygiene and sanitation practices towards\n            improving the health conditions of the targeted population.\n            In view of the project's infrastructure development\n            works, land acquisition, and the resulting resettlement\n            issues will take place; therefore, this resettlement policy\n            framework looks at the estimated population to be displaced,\n            reviews the country's legislation and the Bank's\n            operational directive on involuntary resettlement, and\n            provides resettlement guidance and the compensation measures\n            to be followed. There are two ways to fund compensation:\n            through budgetary provision in the recurrent budget, where\n            the water authority (WWC) earns revenue (this is not\n            normally the case in this project); or, where the need for\n            expropriation has been foreseen in the five-year development\n            plan (this is the case with most expropriations in this\n            project). Expropriation takes place under Article IX of the\n            law of expropriation of Land in the public interest. Based\n            on public consultations, and in agreement with project\n            affected persons, compensation will be paid in cash at\n            market values for loss of land, crops, or physical\n            structures, as well as other assets lost. Monitoring\n            criteria will be in place to ensure compliance with this\n            RAP, as will grievance mechanisms should conflict occur."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Northern Cities Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project : resettlement plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iran - Northern Cities Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project : resettlement plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/04/5728774/iran-northern-cities-water-supply-sanitation-project-resettlement-plan","projn":"IR-Northern Cities Water Supply &\n            Sanitation Project -- P076884","subtopic":"Urban Housing,Environmental Economics & Policies,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement,Urban Services to the Poor","docty":"Resettlement Plan","teratopic":"Social Development,Environment,Urban Development","count":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050412154714"},"theme":"Other urban development,Water resource management,Other human development,Urban services and housing for the poor,Pollution management and environmental health","subsc":"Water supply,Sewerage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Social Development,Environment,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plans, agricultural land,\n            Agriculture, channels, cities, compensation, decision\n            making, due diligence, employment, Entitlements,\n            expropriation, Housing, inflation, Involuntary Resettlement,\n            lagoons, land acquisition, land use, LAP/RAP, Legal\n            framework, legislation, municipalities, parks, pipes,\n            Population Displacement, population growth, Public hearings,\n            public land, public right of way, pumping, pumping stations,\n            RAP, Resettlement, Resettlement Action Plans, Resettlement\n            Policy, rights of way, river, Sanitation, tenants, transfer\n            of title, trees, Urban Development, urban land, urban land\n            use, urban population, waste, waste water, Wastewater,\n            wastewater treatment, water conservation, water consumption,\n            water shortage, Water Supply, water treatment"}},"owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Human development,Urban development","repnb":"RP313"},"facets":{}}}
