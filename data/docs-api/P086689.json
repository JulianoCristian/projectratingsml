Some lessons learned includes: in\n            upper-middle-income countries, especially the ones with high\n            technical capacity, Bank involvement in transport\n            constitutes a true two-way investment. Accompanying the\n            whole reform process, from its design to the solution of the\n            launch problems, was highly instructive and the lessons\n            learned from this experience are greatly valued among other\n            Bank clients. In upper-middle-income countries, access to\n            international experiences and flexibility are more valued\n            than the Bank's financial resources. To successfully\n            implement a Bank project in a country like Chile, the\n            Bank's financial resources constitute little incentive\n            and other elements must be in place. It is difficult to\n            design a good results framework for a Technical Assistance\n            Loan (TAL) or an institutional strengthening component. A\n            TAL that accompanies a Development Policy Loan (DPL) needs\n            careful planning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Santiago Urban Transport Technical\n            Assistance
