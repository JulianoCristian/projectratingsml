Some lessons learned included:\n            investment budgets under management contracts should be\n            sufficient in relation to existing needs if they are to have\n            an impact on the quality of service in line with\n            expectations of the clients. Risks associated with staffing\n            reductions need to be highlighted upfront in project\n            appraisal documents (PADs), especially where project\n            outcomes are partly dependent on the reductions. Moreover,\n            where such reductions are recommended in a project, staff\n            should be recognized as key stakeholders and their concerns\n            considered in the social analysis. The quality of the\n            operator's individual staff is of paramount importance\n            to the success of management contracts. While originally\n            offered staff appeared to possess the required\n            qualifications, the operator changed the expatriate staff of\n            its management team three times. The frequent changes\n            increased the difficulties of operator staff to become\n            knowledgeable of the systems and of the sector governance\n            and in the end reduced their effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Municipal Water and Wastewater Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Municipal Water and\n            Wastewater

There are three\n            project components. The first finances the costs related to\n            the five-year management contract. These costs include a\n            base fee and a performance-based fee to be paid to the\n            Operator according to the achievement of targets defined in\n            the contract. The Operator will be given full responsibility\n            for managing the investment program; operating the water\n            supply and sewerage systems; developing and implementing the\n            demand management program, including a public awareness\n            campaign; and implementing improved commercial (billing and\n            collection) and financial management system. The second\n            component, the Investment Fund, finances works, goods, and\n            services aimed at improving the operation of the water\n            supply and sanitation services, and achieving the\n            performance targets in the management contract. The third\n            component strengthens project implementation by supporting\n            the Project Implementation Unit, including salaries,\n            training, vehicles, and incremental operating costs; and\n            various consulting services for supervision of the\n            management contract and audits, studies, and field\n            investigations related to the

However, these legal\n            provisions have not been systematically implemented in the\n            country, neither has a detailed legislation been enacted,\n            though under the 1993 Law, environmental impact assessment\n            is a pollution control instrument, as well as a development\n            planning instrument, currently being revised in a European\n            Union assisted project.

Rehabilitation of water production\n            facilities, and distribution networks will induce soil, and\n            water contamination by water treatment sludge, including\n            groundwater pollution due to construction run-offs, improper\n            waste disposal, and/or spillage of fuel and oil, while\n            vegetation will be degraded: waste disposal sites will be\n            selected, and drainage and runoffs controlled, including\n            performance of bacteriological, and chemical tests, while\n            oil spillage will be stored in tank/drums, and vegetative\n            propagation enforced. Noise disturbances will be abated by\n            limiting working schedules to daylight hours only, while\n            noise suppression devices will be installed in construction\n            equipment. Dust pollution will be suppressed through water\n            sprinkling, and removal of excess material.
