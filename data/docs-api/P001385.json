The project succeeded in providing eight new\n            and ten expanded Community Junior Secondary School (CJSS)\n            with the necessary facilities. The overall physical\n            objectives and a substantial part of the qualitative\n            objectives of the project have been achieved, although the\n            full impact of the project awaits later evaluation. The lack\n            of a full-time project architect and quantity surveyor\n            handicapped implementation, which in this case was also\n            delayed by unresolved policy matters regarding the Brigades.\n            The fact that the status of the Brigade Centers emerged as\n            an issue soon after the start of implementation suggested\n            that appraisal of this component was inadequate. The\n            Bank's inability to accommodate the Government's\n            request to utilize surplus funds to increase the number of\n            schools to be constructed or expanded showed that the\n            project design did not allow for such variation during\n            implementation. The main lesson would no doubt be that a\n            strong and efficient unit for the implementation of\n            externally financed project is a necessity. Unfortunately,\n            it does not follow from such a statement how this can be\n            achieved. It might be suggested that the Government and the\n            Bank discuss between them possible ways to better integrate\n            Boipelago Education Project Unit (BEPU) into the overall\n            structure of the Ministry of Education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Third Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho - Third Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/12/738280/lesotho-third-education-project","projn":"LS-Educ.
