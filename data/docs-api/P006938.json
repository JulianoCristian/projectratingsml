Three external factors had a substantial\n            impact on project implementation: 1) the earthquake of April\n            22, 1991; 2) the economic recession during 1995-1997, and 3)\n            the contesting of contract awards by outside bidders. There\n            are several lessons that can be learned from the project\n            experience: Integration of quality education subcomponents\n            require intensive coordination and additional implementation\n            time. Public-private sector alliances increase project\n            implementation capacity and effectiveness. Continuity of\n            project implementing personnel is key to maintain\n            satisfactory project execution, especially during and after\n            changes in Government administration.
