Lessons learned were\n            grouped around the following issues: 1) The Bank needs to\n            have a clearer idea of when engagement is simply not\n            effective. In this case, the Bank accepted poor\n            implementation and weak policies and commitment in order to\n            stay engaged. 2) The Bank should be diligent about moving\n            quickly on corruption issues. The Bank could have moved\n            sooner in Turkmenistan, given the gravity of the violation\n            and the fact that there was little evidence of true changes\n            in behavior. 3) One size-fits-all post-Soviet TA projects\n            are not appropriate in all settings. Governance and\n            implementation capacity, particularly decision-making, in\n            Turkmenistan were far too weak to expect success in a\n            standard TA project. 4)  If the Bank is going to reactivate\n            a project with a new focus, it needs to allow a reasonable\n            amount of time for implementation. The decision to put the\n            reactivated project on a \"short leash\" was\n            appropriate given the difficulties of the past; however, one\n            year for a treasury component is highly unrealistic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkmenistan -
