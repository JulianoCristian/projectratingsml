The project includes three\n            components: 1) the EMC service component consists of a large\n            capacity building, and technical assistance program to\n            assist EMC develop businesses, and help develop policy\n            support. The function of the EMC Service Group is to provide\n            service to emerging EMCs, in developing a training programs\n            for their establishment, corporate structuring and\n            identification of types of corporate partners, and in\n            overcoming operational problems. In addition, EMC will\n            advocate, and recommend policy support activities to the\n            Government, international institutions, and other groups to\n            foster industry

Potential adverse impacts\n            identified will follow mitigation measures, where EMCs\n            assume legal responsibilities to ensure environmental\n            compliance. The project will not finance subprojects in\n            direct violation of environmental policies; specifically the\n            following will not be financed: asbestos manufacturing;\n            nuclear energy related products; manufacturing of\n            ozone-depleting substances, or persistent organic\n            pollutants; toxic wastes, insecticides, nor tobacco\n            production. Mitigation includes the following technical\n            measures: for industrial boilers: layer-by-layer coal\n            feeding devices, with pulverizing coal injections to form a\n            floating combustion, with appropriate arch shapes, or,\n            transform combustion boilers into CFB. Steam pipes: condense\n            water recovery, and avoid loss of steam trap leakage, but\n            include pipeline heat insulation. Motor driving systems:\n            adjust frequency conversion technology, and frequency\n            converter. Lighting and power distribution: upgrade\n            distribution voltage, shorten distance of power supply, and\n            upgrade transformers. Control systems: change manual-control\n            into automatic control, with attention to controlling\n            increased energy consumption, and nitrous oxide compounds.\n            Industrial kiln, and furnaces: use heat insulation of\n            furnace body, replacing small furnace and kiln with large,\n            more advanced technology. Combustion systems: use new energy\n            saving burner."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second GEF Energy Conservation\n            Project : environmental
