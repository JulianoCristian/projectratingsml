Some lessons learned included:\n            sensitizing and empowering local populations and technical\n            institutions regarding the relocation of agricultural areas\n            through the process of developing and implementing a\n            relocation action plan facilitates sustainable management of\n            ecologically sensitive areas. The establishment and\n            operation of sub-watershed management committees can make\n            grassroots stakeholders responsible for ensuring\n            intercommunity management of shared resources. Integrating\n            market access and storage facilities will improve the\n            sustainability of project outcomes. Through the introduction\n            of SLM practices, agricultural production increased, however\n            the project did not factor into the design, linkages to\n            markets and provision of storage facilities to preserve\n            their produce.
