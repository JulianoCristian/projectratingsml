Lessons\n            learned from the project are as follows: The Bank's\n            role in promoting judicial independence is a delicate one\n            given its political ramifications. Close coordination among\n            donors remains crucial, given the many institutions involved\n            in legal and judicial reform in Eastern Europe. Active\n            involvement of other donors during preparation and launch\n            stages can help to fill gaps while the often slower\n            implementation process of a World Bank-supported project\n            gets underway. Ensuring commitment and ownership (and\n            adequately assessing capacity levels) of the beneficiary\n            institutions is one way to mitigate the effect of changes in\n            the political leadership during project implementation.\n            Because of the weak capacity, it may have been appropriate\n            to start off with a much simpler (modular) court and case\n            management systems. Introduction of new information\n            technology in weak institutions is more likely to expose\n            underlying organizational problems rather than solve them.\n            Long-standing institutions may need more time and additional\n            support for undergoing change than newly established ones.\n            Monitoring and evaluation is an element of institutional\n            development in its own right."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Legal and Judicial Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Legal and Judicial\n            Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6946260/albania-legal-judicial-reform-project","projn":"AL-Legal & Judicial Reform Project -- P057182","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Legal Institutions of the Market Economy,Technology Industry,Legal Products,Judicial System Reform","teratopic":"Industry,Law and Development,Public Sector Development","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060725100911"},"subsc":"Law and justice,Tertiary education","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Industry,Law and Development,Public Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to legal information, actions, ADR,\n            Alternative Dispute Resolution, authority, basic, Case\n            Management, case management techniques, clauses, commercial\n            disputes, communities, Components, computer equipment,\n            computer literacy, computerization, computers, computing,\n            court administration, Court decisions, court management,\n            court proceedings, courts, criminal cases, data handling,\n            democracy, equipment, European Union, government employees,\n            hardware, implementing agencies, Information Technology,\n            institutional capacity, judges, Judgments, judicial\n            accountability, judicial corruption, judicial decisions,\n            judicial institutions, JUDICIAL REFORM, judicial sector,\n            judicial system, judicial training, judiciary, Justice, Law\n            reform, law schools, laws, lawyers, legal education, legal\n            framework, legal information, legal institutions, legal\n            professionals, legal research, Legal services, legislation,\n            legislative drafting, local area networks, Magistrates,\n            media, Mediation, mediators, organizational reform, private\n            arbitration, procurement, public access, Public\n            Administration Reform, rule of law, State budget, website, workstations"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025578-PHRD-JUDICIAL & PUBLIC\n            ADMIN.
