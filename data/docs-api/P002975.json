The key lessons address the absence of\n            significant pay reform, which would allow the Government to\n            retain professional staff within the civil service, though\n            it is still questionable whether sustainable, capacity\n            building efforts can be undertaken, or even, whether staff\n            will remain with the civil service. Therefore, while pay\n            reform is currently being addressed, a transition strategy\n            will be adopted, which will include financing of\n            professionals on a contract basis, not expected to be for\n            the long-term, nor a substitute for fundamental pay reform.\n            In addition, the information systems, and technology\n            initiatives need to be implemented within the context of a\n            Government-wide information strategy, where institutional\n            arrangements are in place, ensuring standards and\n            consistency. A follow-up operation will include the design\n            of appropriate technology systems, within the context of\n            fiscal management systems. It also addresses the issue of\n            complex multi-components, which do not necessarily prod\n            reforms, nor will these be better coordinated. Thus,\n            prioritized activities should be developed, to ensure\n            adequate sequencing across all programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Economic and Financial Management
