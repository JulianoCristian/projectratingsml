Some lessons learned included:\n            multiple levels of organizational management with vertical\n            and horizontal lines of authority can become unwieldy when\n            even a single element undergoes modification. Fundamental\n            changes at the ministerial level (twice) led to confusion in\n            the lines of authority and ultimately led to delays in\n            implementation. Simpler structures can mitigate such issues,\n            even if they can't prevent them entirely. Indicators\n            that measure outcomes at a level different than that of an\n            intervention can mask shortcomings or miss the opportunity\n            to highlight progress. By setting the primary completion\n            rate indicator at the national level, rather than at the\n            level of the nine targeted regions, the project missed an\n            opportunity to record the more impressive rate of\n            achievement in these areas. Data from the nine regions\n            indicate the primary completion rate more than doubled from\n            23 percent to 46.6 percent, compared to the country as a\n            whole where the rate increased from 38 percent to 51.4\n            percent. This is particularly impressive given the fact\n            these were disadvantaged regions in a post-conflict\n            environment. Thus, linking indicators directly with\n            activities produces a better measure of impact. Both\n            government officials and SEO (Executive Operations\n            Secretariat - Secretariat Executif Operationnel) staff\n            remarked on the multiple changes in Task Team Leader (TTL),\n            and the lack of a more permanent presence in the field by\n            the Bank. Particularly in the middle period of project\n            implementation there was a perception of disengagement,\n            which weakened the Bank's position with the government\n            and other development partners. Staff movement in the Bank\n            is unavoidable, but changes in TTL should be kept to a\n            minimum, and joint handover missions (including the sector\n            manager, if possible) should be the norm."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Education Sector Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Education Sector\n            Reconstruction

Education Sector Reconstruction Project of Burundi are:\n            (a) to improve the capacity of schools to educate a rapidly\n            increasing number of primary-level students; and (b) for the\n            Government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis,\n            strategic planning and program implementation. There are\n            three components of this project. Component 1 deals with the\n            expansion of school facilities. The objective of this\n            component is to contribute to the expansion of primary\n            enrollment on an equitable basis in order to reach universal\n            completion by 2015. It will respond to the significant\n            increase in the rate of enrollment by expanding school\n            infrastructure through supporting the Ministry of National\n            Education and Culture (MINEDUC's) school infrastructure\n            triennial plan (2007-2009). Component 2 deals with the\n            support for teaching and learning. The objective of this\n            component is to contribute to maintain or improve student\n            acquisitions through supporting: (i) the introduction of new\n            in-service programs and devices to train teachers, schools\n            directors and inspectors; (ii) the provision of textbooks\n            and pedagogic materials for all students at the primary\n            level and three subject textbooks for lower secondary\n            students, and setting up a textbooks management mechanism;\n            and (iii) the measurement of learning outcomes undertaking a\n            rapid assessment of reading competency in a sample of\n            primary schools throughout Burundi for each year of the\n            Project. Component 3 focuses on building capacity in\n            MINEDUC.
