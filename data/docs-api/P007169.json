Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated satisfactory. Lessons were\n            several: Political commitment to the project was translated\n            into specific and tangible indicators, such as increased\n            education budgets, supportive policies and regulations, and\n            public-private-nongovernmental organization alliances.\n            Parents, students, teachers, and administrations need to\n            understand how the evaluation of student learning\n            achievement, of teacher performance, and of financial and\n            human resource management contribute to ensuring a more\n            effective and efficient delivery of education services.\n            Community-management improves effectiveness in the delivery\n            of education services. Monitoring and evaluation systems\n            should be able to gauge the impact of inputs in education\n            outcomes. Appropriate planning, and management and\n            information systems are strategic for successful project\n            implementation. Pilot initiatives are an important tool for\n            continuous exploration of innovative and alternative\n            approaches to the delivery of education services. This\n            project exemplifies the benefits of integrating education,\n            health, and nutrition services at the local level. The\n            inter-institutional coordination prompted by such strategies\n            is instrumental in maximizing resource use, expanding access\n            to services, and lowering delivery costs.
