In order to ensure access of the\n            smallest firms to Bank funds and to encourage a broader\n            dispersal of the Bank funds outside the Seoul metropolitan\n            area, it is intended that: (a) at least $15 million of the\n            proceeds of the proposed loan be used to make subloans to\n            firms employing no more than 50 workers or with total assets\n            not exceeding W 250 million; and (b) at least $15 million of\n            the proceeds of the proposed loan be used to finance\n            projects located outside of the city limits of Seoul. The\n            maximum size of individual subloans would be limited to\n            $400,000. The proposed loan would assist CNB in its efforts\n            to support the Government's policy of increasing the\n            regional dispersal of employment opprtunities and of\n            deepening the industrial structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Citizens National Bank (CNB) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Citizens National Bank\n            (CNB) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/03/726375/korea-citizens-national-bank-cnb-project","projn":"KR-Cnb I -- P004089","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Municipal Financial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Korea, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912484897"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accelerated depreciation,ADB,assets,Balance\n            Sheets,Bank of Korea,Basic metals,Book value,capacity\n            utilization,Capital Loans,Cash Flow\n            Statements,cities,collateral,Commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,current prices,debt,depreciation\n            allowances,devaluation,developed countries,Development\n            Strategy,Dividend payout,Dividend payout ratio,Domestic\n            investment,Economic Analysis,economic development,economic\n            growth,employment,Equity Investments,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,export growth,exports,Financial\n            Institutions,Financial Performance,FINANCIAL\n            SECTOR,Financial Structure,FISCAL YEAR,Fisheries,fixed\n            asset,fixed assets,Fixed Capital,Foreign Currency,Foreign\n            Exchange,GNP,Gross Fixed Capital Formation,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Income Statements,industrial\n            expansion,Inflation,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,inventories,KDB,Labor productivity,laws,Legal\n            Framework,legislation,Lending Rates,Long-Term\n            Capital,maturities,money supply,national income,net\n            worth,Organizational Structure,payout ratio,per capita\n            income,Portfolio,productivity,Profitability,real\n            wages,RESOURCE MOBILIZATION,savings,Small Business,terms of\n            trade,transport,unfair competition,value added,wages,Working Capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accelerated depreciation,ADB,assets,Balance\n            Sheets,Bank of Korea,Basic metals,Book value,capacity\n            utilization,Capital Loans,Cash Flow\n            Statements,cities,collateral,Commercial\n            banks,competitiveness,current prices,debt,depreciation\n            allowances,devaluation,developed countries,Development\n            Strategy,Dividend payout,Dividend payout ratio,Domestic\n            investment,Economic Analysis,economic development,economic\n            growth,employment,Equity Investments,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,export growth,exports,Financial\n            Institutions,Financial Performance,FINANCIAL\n            SECTOR,Financial Structure,FISCAL YEAR,Fisheries,fixed\n            asset,fixed assets,Fixed Capital,Foreign Currency,Foreign\n            Exchange,GNP,Gross Fixed Capital Formation,growth\n            rate,imports,Income,Income Statements,industrial\n            expansion,Inflation,interest rate,Interest\n            Rates,inventories,KDB,Labor productivity,laws,Legal\n            Framework,legislation,Lending Rates,Long-Term\n            Capital,maturities,money supply,national income,net\n            worth,Organizational Structure,payout ratio,per capita\n            income,Portfolio,productivity,Profitability,real\n            wages,RESOURCE MOBILIZATION,savings,Small Business,terms of\n            trade,transport,unfair competition,value added,wages,Working Capital"}},"owner":"East Asia & Pacific Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"2829"},"facets":{}}}
