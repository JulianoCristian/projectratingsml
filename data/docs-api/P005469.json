The combined outcome of both\n            projects credit lines is rated unsatisfactory as well as\n            performance of borrower and Bank is rated highly\n            unsatisfactory. Lessons learned from these projects are as\n            follows: (i) the Bank must systematically check that its\n            analytical vigilance is not weakened by long-term\n            relationships of trust established with its clients. In\n            particular, warning signals issued at various Bank levels\n            and more specifically by Operations Evaluation Department\n            (OED) must be followed by accurate and appropriate\n            investigations ensuring that lending operations are soundly\n            based. A similar attitude must prevail as far as the\n            relationship between the Banks client and the sub-borrowers\n            is concerned. (ii) sub loan criteria must be neither\n            neglected nor minimized, whether they are quantitative\n            (Financial Rate of Return  and Economic Rate of Retum ) or\n            qualitative. Careful reviews of the conditions under which\n            the credit line is used and further supervised by the\n            borrower can detect borrowers failures or unnecessary\n            risk-taking. (iii) Finally, Bank management must review the\n            assertions of project teams and systematically challenge\n            those assertions. This will ensure that they are reliable\n            and based on solid information."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - National Agricultural Credit\n            Project and National Rural Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - National Agricultural\n            Credit Project and National Rural Finance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/09/727915/morocco-national-agricultural-credit-project-national-rural-finance-project","projn":"MA-National Rural Finan -- P005486,MA-National Agric.
