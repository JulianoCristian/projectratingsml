The assessment rates overall\n            sustainability as unlikely for both credits. Although most\n            FHIS projects are reported (in project evaluations) to be in\n            use, the same evaluations also note that they are often not\n            used in full and there were many problems with the quality\n            of subprojects and with their maintenance. Overall Bank\n            performance was satisfactory with caveats. Bank staff was\n            overoptimistic about the possibilities of securing\n            maintenance, first by expecting too much from line\n            ministries and later by relying too heavily on user\n            committees. The experience of the two projects offers three\n            lessons: While social funds are attractive for donors and\n            can initially be successful in providing remote communities\n            access to basic health and educational facilities, the\n            experience of the Honduras social fund shows that they are\n            not a long-term sustainable solution for providing basic\n            infrastructure. Because of the apparent success in its core\n            activity of financing basic infrastructure projects, FHIS\n            has been and continues to be attractive for donors for\n            programs that do not belong to the core activity. FHIS had a\n            positive institutional development impact in promoting\n            decentralization by helping to strengthen local government\n            capacities in project planning and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras -

balance and the line ministries strengthen their\n            institutional capacities. It will also support the\n            Government's decentralization strategy, development to\n            the local contracting industry, the sustainability of\n            subprojects, and the targeting of scarce resources in poorer\n            areas. To achieve this, it will focus on meeting priority\n            social and economic departments, municipalities,\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and communities,\n            within the parameters of municipal allocations decided on\n            the basis of a poverty targeting formula. The project will\n            support FHIS's investment program for a four-year\n            period, as well as efforts to establish a better social data\n            base and to assist municipalities on environmental matters.\n            It will provide for (a) a range of small-scale, social and\n            economic infrastructure subprojects; (b) a priority basic\n            needs program; (c) a comprehensive program of technical\n            assistance to help FHIS overcome some institutional\n            weakness; (d) the establishment of a social data mapping\n            system and strengthening of the design and implementation of\n            national household surveys as the major tools to target the\n            poor and to monitor progress of social development programs;\n
