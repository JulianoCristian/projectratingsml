Project sustainability for all five\n            projects is unlikely or non-evaluable. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are adjudged as satisfactory for four\n            of the projects but unsatisfactory for the ASIP. The project\n            audits provide the building blocks for the sector review,\n            which finds impressive improvement. The projects offer six\n            main lessons: 1) Borrower capacity to provide counterpart\n            funding should be projected and realistically assessed, and\n            program design should be adjusted to match the findings of\n            that assessment. 2) There are opportunities for relatively\n            minor adjustments in project strategy and mechanisms which\n            can enhance poverty focus without risk to growth. 3)\n            Publicly funded agricultural research needs to focus not\n            simply on yield maximization but on financial profitability,\n            returns to labor, and the low input technology needs of the\n            poorer farmers. 4) to improve the efficiency of extension\n            services, a phased strategy is needed to increase the role\n            of cost recovery, private sector, community groups, and\n            nongovernmental organizations. 5) Regarding community\n            infrastructure investments, approaches that specifically\n            target the poor. 6) Likely impacts need to be addressed\n            through some form of short-term safety net."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana -

particularly those of smallholders, and to reduce\n            the financial burden on the government of services it\n            provides to the livestock subsector.  This will be achieved\n            through a combination of institutional and policy reforms\n            and investment that will give producers improved access to\n            livestock health services, water and forage resources,\n            improved breeding stock, improved animal production\n            technology and markets. The institutional and policy reforms\n            include:  charging full cost recovery prices for government\n            services in an effort to promote privatization of animal\n            health services; closing down non-productive government\n            farms; restructuring the Ministry of Agriculture's\n            animal production and health services; and community\n            involvement in the development, operation and maintenance of\n            livestock water supplies.  Project investments comprise:\n            (a) strengthening animal health services and developing\n            their infrastructure; (b) developing forage production on\n            range and farm lands; (c) developing livestock water\n            supplies; (d) improving livestock breeds; (e) introducing a\n            pilot dairy development scheme; and (f) institution

particularly those of smallholders, and to reduce\n            the financial burden on the government of services it\n            provides to the livestock subsector.  This will be achieved\n            through a combination of institutional and policy reforms\n            and investment that will give producers improved access to\n            livestock health services, water and forage resources,\n            improved breeding stock, improved animal production\n            technology and markets. The institutional and policy reforms\n            include:  charging full cost recovery prices for government\n            services in an effort to promote privatization of animal\n            health services; closing down non-productive government\n            farms; restructuring the Ministry of Agriculture's\n            animal production and health services; and community\n            involvement in the development, operation and maintenance of\n            livestock water supplies.
