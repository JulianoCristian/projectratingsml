This encouraged communities to\n            salvage materials (thereby re-using debris of the natural\n            disaster), and contribute their own resources to the\n            finishing of their homes. Reconstruction projects need to be\n            linked to livelihood programs under coordination of local\n            governments. Community settlement plans (CSPs) are no longer\n            used to plan for disaster recovery, but have evolved as a\n            tool for medium-term planning at the local government level.\n            In many villages covered by the project, CSPs are now used\n            as a reference in annual planning meetings. Local government\n            involvement is essential to help prevent persons from\n            returning to disaster risk areas. Post-disaster\n            reconstruction is an opportunity to build community\n            awareness and increased resilience toward disaster risk\n            reduction
