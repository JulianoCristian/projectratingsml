Lessons learned from the project: Ensuring\n            implementation readiness conditions prior to negotiations as\n            shown in this operation, leads to a more effective physical\n            and financial execution cycle. Crisis response can be more\n            effective and rapid if built upon existing institutions and\n            on-going portfolio projects. Set up appropriate evaluation\n            criteria at the outset. It is recommended that procurement\n            supervision should be carried out at least once a year.\n            Setting of transparent personnel selection criteria and\n            procedures are likely to increase project execution\n            efficiency and effectiveness resulting in lower\n            administrative costs and probably less frequent changes of\n            key technical and
