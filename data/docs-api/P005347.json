The project,\n            mainly funded by a grant from the Global Environment\n            Facility (GEF), met the GEF criteria of \"pollution\n            reduction in international waters\" category. Lessons\n            show the project's regional approach, proved to have a\n            high demonstration value, through enhanced national, and\n            regional standards, and policies, as well as monitoring of\n            waste reception, and facilities handling. This success, was\n            conducive to adopt a multi-port program, which would include\n            a ship waste system, port oil spill contingency, and a\n            responsive plan for major Moroccan ports. A national port\n            fee schedule will be implemented by the Government, in\n            conjunction with an environmental fund, to provide reserve\n            funds for expanding existing facilities, training, and\n            rehabilitation responsiveness as needed. The overall success\n            can be attributed to both the Bank, and borrower's\n            approach, i.e., the Bank's multidisciplinary team,\n            which provided consistency, and, the strong leadership\n            provided by the implementing agency ensuring an active\n            regional coordination, through the Comite Regional pour\n            Coordination du Projet (CRCP), who established regulatory,\n            and management regimes. However, ship waste projects require\n            enhanced environmental coastal zone, port management plans,\n            and pollution control activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Oil
