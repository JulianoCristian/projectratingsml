The work effort will include the following operational\n            activities: 1) identify and evaluate potential sources of\n            GHG emissions, develop reliable estimates of quantities of\n            GHG emissions from associated and non-associated gas\n            production, and identify appropriate equipment, measures and\n            procedures to reduce these losses; 2) assess the potential\n            for reducing methane leakage as well as the quantities of\n            methane which are vented from pipelines, compressors and\n            other equipment, the quantities of gas which are vented from\n            pneumatic regulators and other control equipment, and the\n            quantities of CO2 emissions; 3) identify and evaluate\n            sources of fugitive methane losses from the distribution\n            network, develop reliable estimates of quantities, and\n            define means and procedures to successfully reduce and\n            mitigate these losses; 4) identify and quantify the sources\n            of GHG emissions in industrial, power generation, district\n            heating installations and households and assess the\n            potential for reducing emissions by improving the energy\n            efficiency of equipment and technologies; and 5) based on\n            these assessments, identify investment projects and changes\n            in construction and operation procedures required to reduce\n            GHG emissions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Greenhouse Gas\n            Reduction
