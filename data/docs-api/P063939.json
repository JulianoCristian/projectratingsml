Issues with NGO engagement\n            affect the implementation and outcome of the project. The\n            key lesson learned from this project is that adjustment\n            loans of sufficient magnitude to have macroeconomic\n            consequences are very high profile, and hence are a very\n            problematic instrument for institutional changes. Avoiding\n            multiple tranche operations in volatile environments is\n            recommended Bank practice now. Adjustment loans that require\n            cross-sectoral implementation by line ministries will be\n            complicated. Avoid adjustment loans with process conditions\n            wherever possible. Consultations should be done very early\n            in the loan preparation, where process is a necessary part\n            of the condition.
