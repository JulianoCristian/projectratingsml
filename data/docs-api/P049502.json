This line of reforms is actively\n            supported by the World Bank, with its most important\n            projects aimed at building up the private sector in Ukraine.\n            In 1996 and 1998, the enterprise development adjustment\n            loans (EDAL) I and II were implemented in two stages. In\n            2002, the World Bank approved granting a loan to Ukraine for\n            the private sector development project. This project is a\n            systemic (adjustment) type, being oriented not only to the\n            extensive development of private enterprises, but also to\n            increasing the efficiency and profitability of production,\n            and the manufacture of competitive products. The project\n            objective is also to ensure that privatized enterprises\n            themselves, after acquiring know-how and work experience\n            under the conditions of new economic realities, become\n            experts and leaders of enterprise restructuring, supporters,\n            and implementers of market ideas in the regions.\n            Introduction of the latest models of information and\n            communication technologies (ICT) can considerably increase\n            the efficiency and expeditiousness of decisions approval,\n            stimulate the development of the private sector, and\n            strengthen civil society in Ukraine. In order to attain\n            these goals, a credit agreement on financing the project\n            Ukraine: e-development was signed in 2003 between the World\n            Bank and the Ukrainian Government. The activities envisaged\n            by the project have positive prospects for consolidating\n            administrative reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects in private sector development"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"World Bank projects in private\n            sector development"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23955301/world-bank-projects-private-sector-development","count":"Ukraine","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Finance,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"administrative reform, bankruptcy,\n            bankruptcy procedures, business enterprises, capital market,\n            capital market regulation, civil society, communication\n            technologies, competitive products, E-Development, economic\n            policies, electronic business, Electronic government,\n            electronic procurement, Enterprise Development, enterprise\n            restructuring, entrepreneurial activity, entrepreneurship,\n            ICT, labor productivity, legal basis, Loan, mass\n            privatization, mass privatization program, private business,\n            private enterprises, private entrepreneurs, Private Sector,\n            Private Sector Development, private sectors, productivity,\n            public administration, regulatory environment, state level,\n            state power, technical assistance, transparency"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Trade and integration,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development,Rule of law","topic":"Private Sector Training m1326141 1575,Enterprise and Corporate Law m1326084 847,Loan-based Programs m1326696 1667,Private Sector Development m1326060 1921,Private Sector Development for PPP\n            m1326063 2260","projn":"UA-Private Sector Development Project (Apl\n            #1) -- P054966,UA-E-Development Project -- P074885,UA-Enterprise Development Adjustment Loan 2\n            (Edal 2) -- P049502,UA-Enterprise Development Adjustment Loan\n            (Edal) -- P035814","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Privatization,Microfinance,Housing & Human Habitats,E-Business,E-Government","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150204150529"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Sub-national government administration,Animal production,Agro-industry,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems,Central government administration,Capital markets,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,General public administration sector,General information and communications sector","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Other accountability/anti-corruption,Participation and civic engagement,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Regulation and competition policy,International financial standards and systems,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Tax policy and administration,Export development and competitiveness,Technology diffusion,Legal institutions for a market economy,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Private Sector Training m1326141 1575,Enterprise and Corporate Law m1326084 847,Loan-based Programs m1326696 1667,Private Sector Development m1326060 1921,Private Sector Development for PPP\n            m1326063 2260","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","B"],"trustfund":"TF022710-INDUSTRY SUBSECTOR RESTRUCTURING,TF027030-INDUSTRIAL SUB-SECTOR RESTRUCTURING,TF029139-PHRD-FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DEVELOPMENT,TF029342-PHRD -ENTERPRISE DEV.\n            ADJUSTMENT LOAN,TF033296-UKRAINE -

Among\n            the lessons learned, it is conveyed that, given the\n            difficult political climate in Ukraine, and the contentious\n            relationship between Government and Parliament, it would be\n            useful to involve participants, from a variety of political\n            spheres, to provide support, and thus create a broad based\n            environment to take into account the stakeholders'\n            views. In turn, the variety of governmental agencies\n            involved in this operation, precluded a strong ownership to\n            be accountable for results, therefore, enabling leadership\n            on the side of the counterpart, could have been beneficial\n            to minimize the many changes occurring in a difficult\n            political environment. The usefulness of adjustment\n            operations is questioned, in light of the complex\n            governmental situation in the country, particularly, as\n            economic reform is largely opposed. Nonetheless,\n            conditionalities were fulfilled by the issuance of decrees,\n            but with a weak subsequent implementation, and, the real\n            long-term impact of the project
