Some lessons learned included:\n            government commitment at the highest level is critical to\n            successful implementation of key education reforms. For\n            example, dramatically increasing the number of teachers in\n            the civil service could have only been accomplished by the\n            government's budget and political commitment to this\n            expansion. Regular meetings with stakeholders to review key\n            monitoring indicators help in identifying key constraints in\n            the system, prioritization of those constraints and\n            interventions to address them. Increase in teacher supply\n            should be accompanied by a detailed and implementable plan\n            on continuous teacher education to ensure the increase in\n            teachers lead to an improvement in education outcomes.\n            Evaluations should be put in place during implementation to\n            allow evidence based decision making about scaling up\n            various alternative interventions. This was not done in this\n            program however it is planned in the next education project.\n            A results framework linking components to measurable\n            baseline and target

        its provincial and district departments in policy\n            development, administration and implementation, monitoring,\n            and evaluation. Some of the negative impacts of the project\n            are: acquisition of land; production systems are dismantled,\n            people face impoverishment if their productive assets, or\n            income sources are lost; people are relocated to\n            environments where their community institutions and social\n            networks are weakened; and kin groups are dispersed and\n            cultural identity, traditional authority, and the potential\n            for mutual help are diminished or lost. Mitigation measures\n            of the project are: 1) Avoiding or minimizing involuntary\n            land acquisition and resettlement, where feasible and\n            exploring all viable alternatives before resorting to\n            involuntary resettlement. 2) Where involuntary resettlement\n            and land acquisition is unavoidable, assistance and\n            sufficient resources should be provided to the project\n            affected persons with the view to maintaining and/or\n            improving their standards of living, earning capacities, and\n            production levels. 3) Encouraging community participation in\n            planning and implementing and acquisition, compensation\n            and/or resettlement, and provision of assistance to affected\n            people regardless of the legality of their land rights or\n            their title to land."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Resettlement policy framework"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Education Sector\n            Support Program Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund :\n            resettlement plan : Resettlement policy framework"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/05/9803542/mozambique-education-sector-support-program-fast-track-initiative-catalytic-fund-resettlement-plan-resettlement-policy-framework","projn":"MZ-Mozambique Education Sector Support\n            Program Fast Track Initiati -- P112052","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Common Property Resource Development,Environmental Economics & Policies,Voluntary and Involuntary Resettlement,Urban Housing,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Urban Development,Rural Development,Social Development","count":"Mozambique","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20080828061248"},"theme":"Education for all","subsc":"Adult literacy/non-formal education,Secondary education,Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Environment,Urban Development,Rural Development,Social Development","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to land, access to services,\n            Agriculture, average costs, Banks, biodiversity, building\n            materials, climate, communities, Community Development,\n            Community Infrastructure, community participation,\n            COMPENSATION, COMPENSATION PAYMENTS, compensation\n            procedures, compensations, construction, construction\n            materials, cultural property, customary rights,\n            DISPLACEMENT, dweller, economic growth, economic\n            opportunities, economic value, Eminent Domain, employment,\n            ENTITLEMENTS, Environmental, environmental impacts,\n            Environmental Management, Environmental Protection,\n            environments, ethnic minorities, fair compensation, Farmers,\n            farms, habitat, Housing, housing programmes, impoverishment,\n            impoverishment risks, income, inflation, Institutional\n            Development, inventory, involuntary resettlement, Labor\n            Costs, LAND ACQUISITION, Land Administration, Land\n            Compensation, land owner, LAND OWNERSHIP, land resources,\n            land rights, land tenure, land title, Land Use, landowner,\n            Lands, Legal Framework, legal provisions, legislation, local\n            administration, local authorities, Local Government, local\n            laws, loss of assets, loss of income, market prices, market\n            value, mitigation, natural resources, payment in kind,\n            policy decisions, poverty line, PROJECT AFFECTED PERSONS,\n            public land, PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, public services, RAP,\n            renovation, replacement costs, Resettlement, Resettlement\n            Action Plans, resettlement activities, Resettlement\n            Assistance, resettlement plans, Resettlement Policy,\n            Resettlement sites, rivers, rural areas, Rural Development,\n            Sacred Sites, social impacts, social networks, social\n            services, social welfare, squatters, sustainable\n            development, technical assistance, towns, training programs,\n            transaction costs, transport, Urban Planning, villages,\n            water supply, waters"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 1 (AFTH1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Human development","repnb":"RP706"},"facets":{}}}
