That is,\n            for agencies with weak contract administration capacity, it\n            is important to strongly insist on moving the\n            \"Engineer\" role to an international (definitely\n            not local) consulting firm. 6) Clear incentives or penalty\n            mechanisms must be enhanced for better consultancy\n            services.7) The maximum number of consultant firms forming a\n            joint venture must be capped. 8) Wider civil society\n            consultation, parallel implementation of social mitigation\n            measures and higher quality impact assessment studies are\n            essential for potentially controversial measures, such as\n            non-motorized transport-free conversion. 9) Car parking\n            strategy should be prepared for converted non-motorized\n            transport -free streets. 10) Public relations and\n            comprehensive communication strategy are particularly\n            important for urban transport projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -

Noise barriers will be established at\n            congested locations, and trees/shrubs will be planted as a\n            practical effect to reduce traffic noise nuisances.

the DMA. The project consists of five\n            components. 1) Infrastructure development will include\n            traffic management measures and system improvements, road\n            improvements, rehabilitation of existing bus terminals,\n            pedestrian facilities improvements, non-motorized transport\n            network improvements, grade-separated interchange\n            facilities, feasibility studies for flyover schemes at\n            Mohahkali and Jatrabari, and flood damage rehabilitation of\n            roads and drainage. 2) Equipment support will provide\n            responsible agencies with necessary equipment, computers,\n            accessories, and vehicles. 3) Institutional strengthening\n            and capacity building will strengthen traffic management,\n            project supervision and management, financial management,\n            environmental management, and performance monitoring to\n            implementing agencies through training, consultant services,\n            and equipment. 4) Policy support and future studies will\n            support the preparation of a long-term transport strategic\n            plan. 5) Land acquisition and resettlement will prepare a\n            policy framework for addressing negative impacts, and a\n            Resettlement Action Plan to assist affected

This\n            resettlement action plan aims to minimize involuntary\n            resettlement, through viable alternative project design\n            options, and, where displacement is unavoidable, vulnerable\n            groups will be assisted in order to, at minimum, regain\n            their standard of living, at no cost to themselves.

While squatters, and vendor\n            encroachers are not entitled to legal compensation, the\n            project will support targeted populations to maintain their\n            livelihoods, through assistance in replacing structures, and\n            assets lost.
