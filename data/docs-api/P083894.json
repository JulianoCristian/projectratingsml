The main\n            lessons learned from the experience under the three TSP\n            operations are: 1) In cases like Timor-Leste where there is\n            high political risk, due in large measure to high\n            unemployment among disgruntled youth, efforts should be\n            directed at creating jobs and achieving \"quick\n            wins\" in poverty-related services, and through work\n            programs; rather than dissipating efforts across a wide\n            range of areas and measures, with little explicit\n            priorities. 2) Where capacity limitations are severe and\n            technical assistance (TA) is normally required to do the\n            work itself, as well as to train a large number of\n            personnel, it is probably more effective to provide TA which\n            is dedicated entirely to training, in parallel to advisors\n            who actually do part of the work. Combining both functions\n            in the same individual, though attractive in principle,\n            often leads to situations where the advisors devote hardly\n            any time to training, and therefore, building local capacity\n            suffers. 3) Quite often, but particularly in countries with\n            limited qualified personnel, success is highly correlated\n            with working with the more competent and committed\n            counterparts. Therefore, where possible, it would be\n            desirable for the Bank to focus its support around proven\n            achievers, while seeking to develop institutional capacity.\n            4) Despite its costs to the Government and its development\n            partners, which can be high at times, the benefits of active\n            donor coordination are often worthwhile and outweigh its\n            costs, as demonstrated by the experience under the TSP program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - First, Second, Third\n            Transition Support

Timor-Leste had the following ratings: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. The Second Timor-Leste\n            Transition Support Program had the following ratings:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            included: 1) Fostering ownership and supporting country\n            systems. As a budget support operation, the TSP has ensured\n            that the use of funds from the operation responds to\n            Government priorities, supporting ownership; 2) Building\n            management capacity and results-orientation through program\n            implementation. The TSP has supported capacity building\n            through its dialogue on policy design and implementation and\n            its monitoring of results. The Government's capacity is\n            much stronger in these areas today than it was at the\n            restoration of independence; 3) Prioritizing for results in\n            a capacity-constrained environment; 4) Balancing short-term\n            results with long-term institution-building. Budget support\n            operations such as TSP play an important role in the\n            long-term strengthening of Government systems and processes\n            and the development of institutional structures; 5)\n            Supporting a whole-of-Government approach. In bringing the\n            majority of Timor-Leste's development partners together\n            around a whole-of-Government framework for development, the\n            TSP has provided an anchor for all donor-financed activities\n            in the country; 6) Providing timely analytical inputs for\n            appropriate program design and fruitful dialogue. The TSP\n            has been built on detailed analytical work to guide the\n            design of program objectives and activities; 7) Balancing\n            coverage and focus. The TSP brought to light the challenges\n            of budget support in low-income, low-capacity countries; and\n            8) Minimizing the burden of preparation, appraisal, and\n            monitoring. The Government and, in particular, the Ministry\n            of Planning and Finance as the main coordinating agency, has\n            argued that TSP progress and appraisal missions have placed\n            a considerable burden on the administration, with the\n            counterpart teams fully engaged in the TSP process during missions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Third Transition

to put in place key governance institutions,\n            strengthen institutions, develop day-to-day service\n            functions and implement a modest development program in the\n            lean years before substantial oil and gas revenues come on\n            stream. The program focuses on the development of\n            institutions and the delivery of public services that are\n            critical for a stable transition to Independence and the\n            effective use of future oil and gas wealth. On the basis of\n            the Government's FY2005 budget submissions, budgetary\n            and balance of payments support financing requirements for\n            FY2005 are estimated at US$31 million, which should be fully\n            covered by IDA and TSP partners' co-financing. The\n            Transition Support Program (TSP) presents a sub-set of the\n            highest priority actions drawn from the Government's\n            strategic planning instruments (notably the National\n            Development Plan, sector policies and Sector Investment\n            Programs) and reflected in agencies' FY2005 Annual\n            Action Plans (AAPs) and budgets. In consultation with\n            Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPF), Government agencies\n            identified their TSP priorities, together with quarterly\n            milestones and performance targets to guide implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste -
