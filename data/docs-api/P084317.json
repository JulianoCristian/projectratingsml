The risk to development outcome\n            was substantial; the Bank's performance was moderately\n            satisfactory; and the borrower's performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. The reason for the restructuring\n            allows for the extension of the closing date for one year to\n            allow for completion of activities under Component 2,\n            concerning rehabilitation of the school infrastructure, of\n            the project development objective and revision of the\n            results framework. Lessons learned from this project\n            include, 1) capacity development and institutional\n            strengthening take time to materialize especially in a\n            post-conflict context and need to factor greatly into all\n            aspects of project design; 2) working effectively with other\n            organizations in project implementation necessitates a\n            thorough understanding of each organization's\n            procedures, guidelines and field-level practice in the\n            design phase; 3) persistency in investments in equity pays\n            off; and 4) project documentation and reporting should be\n            consistent and organized especially in terms of the M&E\n            framework established to monitor progress under the
