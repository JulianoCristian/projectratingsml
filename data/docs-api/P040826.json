Among the lessons applicable to both loans\n            are: 1) Financial/fiscal crises offer opportunities for\n            structural change in banking. 2) Structural/ownership change\n            in banking requires resources to restructure past losses. 3)\n            Even when sufficient financial resources are available,\n            there will be selection bias in the roster of potential\n            acquirers. It is unclear whether program design features\n            alone can overcome that bias. 4) Funds were disbursed only\n            after the careful review of the individual transactions. 5)\n            Some of the banks created through these transactions may\n            require additional restructuring as market conditions\n            change. Some failures need to be anticipated. 6) A strong\n            borrower commitment is indispensable in such complicated,\n            time-intensive transactions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

negative and their liquidity has become\n            precarious. These banks are now draining already weak\n            provincial finances and present a systemic risk to the\n            banking system. Thus the provincial as well as the federal\n            authorities have asked for urgent financial assistance in\n            pursuing privatization as a way to restructure and sell the\n            remaining sound assets and liabilities to the private\n            sector. The Provincial Bank Privatization Loan adjustment\n            operation is directed at assisting the national government\n            to provide an orderly framework in which federal financial\n            support for costs associated with privatization/closure is\n            provided, subject to: (i) legislative authorization of\n            privatization at the provincial level; (ii) intervention of\n            the Superintendency of Banks; (iii) change of management;\n            (iv) a time-bound, transparent privatization process; (v)\n            timely resolution of residual assets and liabilities; and\n            (vi) bank closure in the event of failed privatization. The\n            loan is expected to support the privatization of some\n            fifteen provincial banks, representing about 10% of total\n            banking or 40% of provincial banking
