One key\n            aspect of capacity building should be training in\n            management. Competence in management has been an important\n            lesson learned from implementation of National Pension\n            Scheme Authority reforms. A very firm vision of a private\n            sector driven economy is necessary to overcome the\n            hesitation that accompanies the decision to pursue\n            privatization.

The project will address poverty reduction\n            objectives: At the general level, the project directly\n            contributes to the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic\n            framework conducive to economic growth by ensuring the\n            fiscal progress achieved in the last few years will be\n            long-lasting. Also, the reforms in budget management will\n            help ensure that public expenditures, especially social\n            expenditures, will reach the poor in the most effective way.\n            The main benefits of the project are macroeconomic\n            stability, a sustainable fiscal position, higher economic\n            growth, and more efficient, effective, and equitable public\n            expenditures. The risk associated with this program include:\n            a) reform program may falter because of major policy\n            reversals, external shocks, and/or limited institutional and\n            managerial capacity. b) The authorities may fail to take\n            specific reforms supported by the project due to opposition\n            from vested interest groups. These risks have been mitigated\n            by the strength of the government's ownership and\n            commitment to implement proposed measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Fiscal Sustainability Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - Fiscal Sustainability\n            Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/05/728875/zambia-fiscal-sustainability-credit-project","projn":"ZM-Fisc Sust.Cr.
