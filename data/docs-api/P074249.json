Some\n            lessons learned included: A multi-sectoral strategy requires\n            does not mean that the funding should not be targeted. The\n            Bank should focus support for implementation on those\n            sectors where activities have the greatest potential impact\n            on the epidemic and with some comparative advantage in\n            implementation such as the Ministry of Health, and those\n            ministries related to the military, education, and\n            transport. Implementation of a multi-sectoral strategy\n            requires that roles and responsibilities (along with the\n            accompanying human and financial resources) be defined and\n            respected by the various public and private actors. While\n            the project succeeded in building capacity through\n            traditional means its greater success may have been in\n            focusing on facilitation and coordination rather than\n            command and control. It is a challenge to ensure political\n            commitment to target vulnerable populations. The key to\n            maintaining political commitment at all levels are not\n            necessarily compatible with improving the targeting of\n            vulnerability factors. The transition from: (i) information\n            and sensitization of the general population to; and (ii)\n            support for more focused groups (women, youths, orphans,

The main project\n            objectives will include initiatives by the public, and\n            private sectors to strengthen the institutional framework,\n            and build capacities responsive to the epidemic. However,\n            the presence of biomedical wastes within the framework of\n            the project, poses adverse environmental impacts, due to the\n            potential, inadequate handling of infected materials. This\n            environmental assessment addresses specifically the\n            management of biomedical wastes, and examines the\n            institutional capacity within health institutions and local\n            authorities, to propose a feasible plan of action, to reduce\n            HIV/AIDS infection risks. Measures to mitigate biomedical\n            wastes disposal are as follows. Institutional, legal and\n            regulatory frameworks will be strengthened through\n            inter-governmental efforts by the Environment, Agriculture\n            and Public Health ministries to implement, and enforce\n            environmentally sound waste management practices. Health\n            facilities will be provided with sanitary equipment for the\n            collection, and removal of biomedical wastes, as well as\n            trained personnel in precautionary practices for handling\n            infected, or non-sterilized medical wastes, and, the choice\n            of small incinerators will be available for hospital uses.\n            Moreover, training and specific programs will be available\n            for health providers, to develop awareness on the direct,\n            and indirect risks of inappropriate wastes handling.\n            Effluent discharges will undergo adequate treatment at the\n            municipal level, including systematic incineration plans,\n            and compacted waste disposal. Public awareness will aim at\n            sensitizing communities on the related risks between AIDS\n            and biomedical waste disposal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Projet VIH/SIDA : gestion des\n            dechets biomedicaux"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cap Vert \u2013 Projet VIH/SIDA :\n            gestion des d\u00e9chets biom\u00e9dicaux"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/03/1804995/cape-verde-projet-vihsida-gestion-des-dechets-biomedicaux","projn":"CV-Hiv/Aids Project -- P074249","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Cabo Verde","authors":{"authr":"Doucoure, Djibril"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02061404082940"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Health,Other social services,Sub-national government administration,Central government administration","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Biomedical materials; Waste management;\n            Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; HIV viruses; Disease\n            prevention & control; Public-private partnerships;\n            Institutional framework; Legal & regulatory framework;\n            Environmental protection; Capacity building; Medical wastes;\n            Hospital equipment; Sanitation equipment; Sanitation\n            removal; Waste disposal; Environmental regulations; Health\n            care facilities; Training assistance; Incinerators; Health\n            providers; Medical practice; Effluents; Water treatment;\n            Municipal infrastructure; Public awareness"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026787-PHRD-CAPE VERDE: CAPE VERDE HIV/AIDS","repnb":"E595"},"1729367":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/03/1729367/cape-verde-hivaids-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/03/1729367/cape-verde-hivaids-project","new_url":"2002/03/1729367/cape-verde-hivaids-project","disclosure_date":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/03/29/000094946_0203200401192/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/03/29/000094946_0203200401192/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","datestored":"2002-03-29T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2002-03-07T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - HIV/AIDS Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This project supports the goal of the\n            national HIV/AIDS strategy of the government of Cape Verde,\n            which is to reduce the spread of HIV infection in the\n            country.
