To meet the requirement for functional guarantees\n            for plant performance, a contractor faces technical and\n            financing challenges, as well as other factors that are out\n            of the control of the contractor, such as fuel quality.\n            Qualified bidders may not want to take the risks on\n            functional guarantees and to bear on high financial\n            commitments. Perhaps the prudent solution for such\n            investments is through private participation, where the\n            private investor is given the mandate of rehabilitating the\n            plant as well as operating it thereafter. This approach may\n            reduce risk perceptions, and also provide sufficient\n            incentives to the private sector to undertake such\n            investments. A strong and well-staffed implementing agency\n            equipped with suitable decision making authority is\n            necessary for such a large and complex project to be\n            implemented successfully. In addition, it would be useful to\n            consider hiring the services of a qualified and experienced\n            firm to assist the implementing agency in project management\n            and supervision, starting with preparation of tender\n            documents, managing the procurement process, and eventually\n            assisting in implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

This\n            environmental assessment identifies environmental risks\n            connected with the project, and discusses measures to\n            mitigate them. Suggestions are as follows. Minimize dust\n            emissions from land clearing, from drilling and blasting and\n            ground excavation, as well as due to facility construction,\n            and from equipment traffic over temporary roads at the\n            construction site, by using the following methods: Cover\n            stockpiled material with suitable sheet material; sprinkle\n            water on construction areas, and access roads; limit vehicle\n            speed, cover vehicles, and maintain equipment and machinery.\n            Mix ash with gypsum, to be conveyed to mining disposal area.\n            Treat wastewaters from construction areas prior to its\n            discharge to river bodies, and, monitor groundwater quality.\n            Solid wastes, medical and oily wastes, hazardous wastes\n            (such as used batteries, bitumen, cables, copper,\n            fire-fighting foam, adhesives, general chemicals, acids, oil\n            rags and absorbents, solvents, contaminated soils,\n            insulation, paint sludge, used oil and paint cans and drums\n            etc.) should be packaged to be collected in black bags,\n            separated from medical, hazardous, dangerous and packaged\n            wastes. Separately collected domestic wastes will be\n            transported to a temporary waste storage center or\n            container, by special vehicles to be stored separately.\n            Store those recyclable wastes in separate closed containers.\n            Segregate paper, cardboards, plastics and metal packaged\n            wastes according to their type, to be collected in blue\n            bags. Handle other, including hazardous and medical, waste\n            according to regulations. To control noise, restrict hours\n            of operation, and ensure vehicle noise does not exceed\n            permitted levels. To minimize industrial accidents, train\n            personnel in health and safety issues, have workers wear\n            protective equipment, set up a health center on site, and\n            use fire prevention measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Energy Liberalization Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Energy Liberalization\n            Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/05/6791054/turkey-energy-liberalization-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"TR-Electricity Generation Rehabilitation And\n            Restructuring Project -- P085561","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Environment and Energy Efficiency,Water and Industry,Energy Production and Transportation,Energy and Environment","count":"Turkey","authors":{"authr":"KEMA International B.

This environmental\n            assessment summary briefly identifies environmental risks\n            connected with the project and discusses measures to\n            mitigate them. Among the suggestions the following are\n            offered. Minimize dust emissions from land clearing,\n            drilling and blasting, ground excavation, cut and fill\n            operations, facility construction, and from equipment\n            traffic over temporary roads at the construction site by\n            using the following methods: Cover stockpiled material with\n            suitable sheet material; sprinkle water on access roads,\n            limit vehicle speed, cover vehicles, and maintain equipment\n            and machinery. Mix ash with gypsum and convey to mining\n            disposal area. Treat wastewater from workers before\n            discharge to river bodies, and monitor groundwater quality.\n            Solid waste from the personnel, medical wastes, and oily\n            wastes, hazardous wastes such as used batteries, bitumen,\n            cables, copper, fire-fighting foam, adhesives, general\n            chemicals, acids, oil rags and absorbents, solvents,\n            contaminated soils, insulation, paint sludge, used oil and\n            paint cans and drums etc. and package wastes will be\n            collected at black bags separated from medical, hazardous,\n            dangerous and package wastes. Separately collected domestic\n            wastes will be transported to temporary waste storage center\n            or container by special vehicles and stored separately.\n            Store recyclable wastes in different closed containers.\n            Segregate paper, cardboards, plastics and metal package\n            wastes according to their type and collected by blue bags.\n            Handle other, including hazardous and medical, waste\n            according to regulation. To control noise, restrict hours of\n            operation and ensure vehicle noise does not exceed stated\n            levels. To minimize industrial accidents, train personnel in\n            health and safety issues, have workers wear protective\n            equipment, set up health center on site, and use fire\n            prevention measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rehabilitation of the Afsin-Elbistan A\n            Thermal Power Plant"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Energy Liberalization\n            Project : environmental impact assessment summary :\n            Rehabilitation of the Afsin-Elbistan A Thermal Power Plant"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6579709/turkey-energy-liberalization-project-environmental-impact-assessment-summary-rehabilitation-afsin-elbistan-thermal-power-plant","projn":"TR-Electricity Generation Rehabilitation And\n            Restructuring Project -- P085561","subtopic":"Brown Issues and Health,Wastewater Treatment,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"Board Report","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Turkey","authors":{"authr":"KEMA International B.
