Lessons outline the\n            partnership success due to the combination between the Bank\n            financing, the Government of Finland grant. The focus on\n            inspection and enforcement balanced the soft loan provided\n            to the end-users, taking into account the prevailing\n            conditions during project preparation. Lessons further\n            reinforce the importance of design flexibility, for it\n            allowed the project to survive external shocks through\n            corrective measures. However, any future projects should\n            probably be more results oriented in terms of environmental\n            improvement objectives. It is important to highlight that\n            involving training institutions and industrial organizations\n            in the project has been essential in attracting high numbers\n            of participants, and in ensuring sustainability, and wide\n            dissemination of experience gained. Lessons on the project\n            as a vehicle for dialogue with the Government, can be\n            measured through the keenness of the Ministry of\n            Environment, as well as the Apex bank in particular, to\n            replicate and build on the project's experience."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt -

Its specific objectives are to strengthen the\n            monitoring and enforcement capabilities of the environmental\n            institutions and establish technical and financial\n            mechanisms for supporting pollution abatement investments in\n            Greater Cairo, Alexandria, and the Suez Canal cities of Suez\n            and Ismailia. The project has two main components: 1) The\n            Technical and Institutional Support component provides\n            technical assistance, studies, training, monitoring\n            equipment and field vehicles to support four project\n            sub-components, namely a) strengthening the capacity of\n            environmental affairs agency branches and Governorates\n            Environment Management Units; b) developing pollution\n            abatement action plans for major industrial polluters; c)\n            reviewing and conducting environmental audit programs and\n            training, technical assistance, and establishing a database\n            on cost effectiveness; and d) promoting awareness through\n            seminars, workshops, and media education programs; and\n            strengthening the technical and administrative capacity of\n            local nongovernmental organizations. 2) The Pollution\n            Abatement Investment component funds environmental\n            investment sub-projects in public and private enterprises to\n            bring their effluent discharges and/or air emissions in\n            compliance with
