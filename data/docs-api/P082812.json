Some\n            lessons learned includes: flexibility of project design and\n            implementation was instrumental in enabling the project to\n            adapt to changing political conditions during\n            implementation. Flexibility of the project design allowed\n            for changes during implementation without having to change\n            the Project Development Objectives (PDOs), as demonstrated\n            by the restructurings of May 2009 and March 2011. The\n            neighborhood development plans can serve as an efficient\n            tool to facilitate improvements in service delivery and\n            municipal and urban management, and to accompany\n            decentralization. The LIDP confirmed findings from other\n            urban development projects in the Africa Region that this\n            approach and its tools (priority investment program,\n            priority maintenance program, and municipal support program)\n            can be used to effectively link infrastructure development,\n            maintenance, and capacity building. Demand-driven selection\n            through participatory arrangements for upgrading\n            communities' infrastructure is most suited to address\n            the sustainability of services in low-income settlements. A\n            demand-based approach to the selection and financing of\n            community infrastructure needs is appropriate to ensure\n            transparency in resource allocation and strengthened social\n            cohesion, while at the same time improving the prospects for\n            sustainable operation of financed facilities. Community\n            engagement and sensitization during project implementation\n            proved to be a successful approach. This approach could be\n            adopted by municipalities as an essential measure to\n            accompany all future actions defined in their neighborhood\n            management plans comprising maintenance operations. Since\n            the project involved a number of stakeholders, strong\n            ownership at all levels, accompanied by continuous dialogue\n            among all parties involved, was required to successfully\n            address issues raised and implement adequate measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gabon - Local Infrastructure Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gabon -

Local Infrastructure Development\n            Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Local Infrastructure Development\n            Project for Gabon has two main objectives: 1) increasing\n            access of the population living in low-income settlements to\n            basic services; and 2) increasing access of small- and\n            medium-sized enterprise (SME) to civil work and construction\n            contracts with the public sector. The purpose of the\n            restructuring is to: (i) focus on the project activities\n            that are critical to achieve the Project Development\n            Objective (PDO) by increasing their allocations to\n            compensate for cost escalation; and (ii) reduce the scope of\n            activities related to part of the project. The restructuring\n            will involve: (a) streamlining a number of project\n            activities; (b) reallocating among project components; and\n            (c) simplifying some of the output indicators for added\n            practicality and easier monitoring. As a result of the\n            restructuring, it is expected that the PDO will be achieved\n            and the implementation and monitoring of the project will\n            improve. The restructuring is based on the following\n            rationale: 1) strengthen the focus of the project on the\n            component targeting community-based infrastructure upgrading\n            in low-income settlements, which are critical to achieve the\n            PDO; and 2) reduce the number and complexity of output\n            indicators for easier monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Gabon - Local Infrastructure Development\n            Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Gabon - Local Infrastructure\n            Development Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/05/10658385/gabon-local-infrastructure-development-project-restructuring","projn":"GA-Local Infrastructure Development Project\n            -- P082812","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"m,Public Sector Economics,Housing & Human Habitats,Debt Markets,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Transport,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Gabon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20090610235938"},"theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Participation and civic engagement,Municipal governance and institution building","subsc":"General public administration sector,Other social services,Other industry,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General transportation sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Transport,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to financing, audits, Bank Borrowers,\n            Bank policies, beneficiary, bid, Borrower, Cadastre,\n            Capacity Building, cities, communities, community\n            participation, competitive bidding, construction industry,\n            contribution, Credits, deposit, disbursements, drainage,\n            engineers, equipment, expenditures, financial environment,\n            Financial management, government capacity, Government\n            policy, INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT, infrastructure projects,\n            infrastructure upgrading, investment program, lack of\n            experience, living conditions, Loan, Loan Agreement, loan\n            amount, Loan disbursements, loan proceeds, local capacity,\n            local government, local governments, LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE,\n            low income, low-income, municipalities, national budget,\n            neighborhood, neighborhoods, occupations, poverty\n            alleviation, private sector, provisions, Public, public\n            contracts, public infrastructure, public investment, public\n            procurement, public rights, public sector, public works,\n            road, roads, roadway, sanitation, settlements, timely\n            payment, total cost, transport, urban services, vehicles"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"majtheme":"Urban development,Public sector governance,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"48850"},"facets":{}}}
