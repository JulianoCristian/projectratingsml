The\n            objective of all three projects is to expand Mexico's\n            livestock and agricultural production by: (a) increasing the\n            flow of medium- and long-term credit into agriculture; (b)\n            encouraging private banks toward medium-term lending for\n            agriculture, which they have traditionally shunned largely\n            because of lack of experience; (c) expanding the processing\n            of agricultural and livestock products; and (d) providing\n            technical services to producers. An additional feature of\n            the new project would be the financing of rural works and\n            infrastructure designed to serve groups of small farmers and\n            cattle owners."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Third Livestock and Agricultural\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Third Livestock and\n            Agricultural Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1971/04/1556308/mexico-third-livestock-agricultural-development-project","projn":"MX-Livestock Iii-270726 -- P007521","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mexico","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North America!$!80465"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903182651"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural credit,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,Bank loans,banking\n            system,bonds,borrowing,capital expenditures,capital\n            flows,capital goods,cattle,Cd,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,consumers,cotton,credit\n            policies,crops,current expenditures,current\n            prices,debt,deposits,distribution of income,economic\n            growth,economic\n            problems,employment,exports,farmers,farms,fiscal\n            year,fisheries,foreign exchange,forestry,GDP,GDP\n            deflator,GNP,growth rate,housing,IDB,imports,income\n            distribution,insurance,interest rate,interest\n            rates,irrigation,Livestock,livestock development,livestock\n            products,maturities,Money supply,policy decisions,population\n            growth,private banks,producers,productivity,public\n            borrowing,public enterprises,public expenditures,public\n            savings,reserve requirements,resource mobilization,rural\n            poverty,small banks,technical\n            assistance,transport,USAID,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural credit,agricultural\n            output,agricultural production,agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank lending,Bank loans,banking\n            system,bonds,borrowing,capital expenditures,capital\n            flows,capital goods,cattle,Cd,commercial\n            banks,consolidation,consumers,cotton,credit\n            policies,crops,current expenditures,current\n            prices,debt,deposits,distribution of income,economic\n            growth,economic\n            problems,employment,exports,farmers,farms,fiscal\n            year,fisheries,foreign exchange,forestry,GDP,GDP\n            deflator,GNP,growth rate,housing,IDB,imports,income\n            distribution,insurance,interest rate,interest\n            rates,irrigation,Livestock,livestock development,livestock\n            products,maturities,Money supply,policy decisions,population\n            growth,private banks,producers,productivity,public\n            borrowing,public enterprises,public expenditures,public\n            savings,reserve requirements,resource mobilization,rural\n            poverty,small banks,technical\n            assistance,transport,USAID,working capital"}},"owner":"WB Off:Mexico - MX & CO CMU (LCC1C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North America"},"1":{"geo_region":"North America"},"2":{"geo_region":"North America"}},"repnb":"P924"},"facets":{}}}
