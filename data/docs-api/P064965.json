Constraints\n            caused by population density, hilly terrain, and erosion\n            make it a critical determinant of rural poverty. Since 2001\n            Rwanda has worked closely with International Development\n            Association (IDA) to achieve food security and increase\n            agricultural productivity - food security was attained in\n            2010 and between 2000-01 and 2010-11 poverty was reduced by\n            about 14 percent.

First Rural Sector Support Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the First Rural Sector\n            Support Project (RSSP1) for Government of Rwanda (GoR) were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the importance\n            of maintaining a tight focus on an agenda that is manageable\n            given the capacity constraints under which the project\n            operates. As initially designed and approved by the Board,\n            RSSP1 included seven components spanning a wide range of\n            activities. Early implementation experience revealed that\n            the scope of the design was overly ambitious, and that the\n            Government lacked the technical and institutional capacity\n            needed to implement such a broad array of activities. The\n            December 2005 restructuring successfully focused the Project\n            on a core set of activities. The need to build capacity in\n            the Project Support and Coordination Unit (PSCU) to ensure\n            effective implementation of the four safeguards policies\n            triggered by RSSP2, and the need for the Bank to assist the\n            Borrower effectively on safeguards. RSSP was in early\n            compliance with the environmental and social safeguards\n            triggered at appraisal and was found to have strong\n            environmental capacity in the PSCU, but general safeguards\n            capacity was found to be low. In hindsight, the Bank team\n            was slow to act, and should have informed GoR of the policy\n            earlier. The policy has now been fully integrated in the\n            current phase. The importance of a consistent, coherent and\n            straightforward M&E system clearly articulated in the\n            Project Appraisal Document (PAD), with indicators clearly\n            connected to the Project Development Objectives (PDO). Over\n            time, the streamlining of the results framework allowed the\n            borrower to develop a workable process for collecting data\n            and reporting on output and outcome indicators, which saved\n            the situation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - First Rural Sector Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - First Rural Sector\n

launch the intensification process. Phase I\n            includes seven components: The first component will empower\n            beneficiary farmers to efficiently manage\n            marshland/hill-side cropping and livestock activities and\n            promote the adoption of improved soil, water and, fertility\n            conservation techniques; and private operators to intervene\n            in land and water infrastructure construction and\n            maintenance. The integrated management of critical\n            ecosystems component will strengthen the capacity of local\n            communities to effectively manage critical ecosystems. The\n            promotion of commercial and export agriculture component\n            will develop export crop agriculture through facilitation of\n            access to investment capital and strengthening of capacities\n            of farmers and exporters. The fourth component will\n            strengthen the capacities of agricultural research and\n            extension systems. The fifth component will strengthen the\n            capacities of local communities, private sector operators,\n            farmers and other private sector operators, and water\n            management infrastructure to develop small-scale\n            infrastructure.

which\n            rehabilitates marshland and hillside areas, supports\n            agricultural services delivery systems and rural transport ,\n            and promotes off-farm productive activities. Following are\n            measures that mitigate anticipated adverse environmental\n            impacts: Supplying guidelines for contractors and an\n            environmental code of conduct and adopting good site\n            practices will minimize disruption of hydrology and water\n            quality. Watershed management, using green and organic\n            manure, and increasing the efficiency of irrigation methods\n            will reduce organic matter and shrinkage and soil\n            acidification. Creating buffer zones, diversifying crops,\n            and establishing a biodiversity conservation and\n            agro-forestry program will diminish biodiversity loss.\n            Regular monitoring of nitrogen and phosphorus contents of\n            drainage water will alleviate changes in surface water\n            quality. Strict supervision during construction, limiting\n            the use of fire, and replanting will restore destroyed\n            vegetation. Establishing buffer zones with vegetation to\n            filter sediments and planting trees and grasses on hillsides\n            will counter siltation. Using biological control agents such\n            as fish will reduce mosquito larvae and snails and\n            consequently reduce health risks and incidences of\n            water-borne diseases. Monitoring the water table and\n            controlling water speed will moderate changes in ground\n            water level and quantity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Rural Sector Support Project
