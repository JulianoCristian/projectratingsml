Two main lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, support pricing mechanisms for an export\n            commodity are difficult to sustain over an extended period,\n            particularly when competitiveness is affected by exchange\n            rate maladjustment. This can lead to a debilitating impact\n            on the institutions that finance the expansion of\n            cultivation of such crops.
