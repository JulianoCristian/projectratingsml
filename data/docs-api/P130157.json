Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to maintain sufficient flexibility, particularly in the case\n            of the envisaged programmatic policy development loans, so\n            as to adapt and respond to client needs and economic\n            realities in the country. As the external environment was\n            rather negative during the FSPBG preparation phase, adding a\n            strong sense of urgency to the need to adopt financial\n            sector related reforms, the team built sufficient ownership\n            of the many policy and regulatory changes. The conversion of\n            the second DPL to a PBG, which significantly leveraged the\n            Bank's lending, was a direct result of the Montenegrin\n            2012 financing gap, as the prior actions were not\n            significantly different. During the Eurozone financial\n            crises, it proved crucial that this operation narrowly\n            focused on key areas for good outcomes. The proposed\n            operation incorporates this lesson by focusing on a main\n            challenge recognized by the Government, namely, addressing\n            vulnerabilities in the banking sector and making the banking\n            sector more resilient to cope with possible future shocks.\n            Public understandings of key financial stability measures\n            adopted were substantially improved through a carefully\n            planned and implemented communication strategy by the\n            Government and the Bank. The staff of the World Bank Country\n            Office in Podgorica played a crucial role in this regard by\n            ensuring consistent and timely communication with key\n            stakeholders. The Bank also kept civil society and the\n            general public informed of its position on critical issues\n            through interviews to national media and press releases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Montenegro - Financial Sector Policy Based\n            Guarantee Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Montenegro - Financial Sector\n            Policy Based

They acknowledged that the\n            Policy Based Guarantee will assist the country in its\n            efforts to continue accessing international capital markets,\n            diversify its borrowing portfolio, and raise funds on more\n            competitive terms as well as support the country's\n            integration efforts into the European Union. Directors noted\n            that in spite of the enduring Euro zone vulnerabilities and\n            severe 2012 winter, the Government has maintained an\n            adequate macroeconomic framework and continued its\n            structural reforms. Directors noted the slowdown in the\n            country's economic growth and high financing needs and\n            welcomed further collaboration between the Bank, European\n            Union and other development partners."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Montenegro - Financial Sector Policy Based\n            Guarantee Project : summary of discussion"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Montenegro - Financial Sector\n            Policy Based Guarantee Project : summary of discussion"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16473144/montenegro-financial-sector-policy-based-guarantee-project-summary-discussion","projn":"ME-Montenegro Financial Sector Policy Based\n            Guarantee -- P130157","docty":"Board Summary","subtopic":"Trade and Regional Integration,Debt Markets,Corporate Law,Emerging Markets,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,International Economics and Trade,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Montenegro","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120706021117"},"theme":"International financial standards and systems,Regulation and competition policy,Other Financial Sector Development","subsc":"Banking","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Law and Development,International Economics and Trade,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"Guarantees","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"banking sector, banks, depositors, economic\n            growth, Financial Sector, Financial Sector Policy,\n            integration efforts, international capital, international\n            capital markets, portfolio, regulatory framework, structural\n            reforms, systemic risk, Union"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","trustfund":"TF071228-Second Emergency Demobilization\n            and Reintegration Project in Rwanda","majtheme":"Financial and private sector development","repnb":"70870"},"16347155":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/05/16347155/montenegro-financial-sector-policy-based-guarantee-program","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/05/16347155/montenegro-financial-sector-policy-based-guarantee-program","new_url":"2012/05/16347155/montenegro-financial-sector-policy-based-guarantee-program","disclosure_date":"2012-07-03T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-07-03T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-07-03T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/06/08/000333038_20120608012529/Rendered/INDEX/661510PGD0P1300Official0Use0Only090.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/06/08/000333038_20120608012529/Rendered/PDF/661510PGD0P1300Official0Use0Only090.pdf","datestored":"2012-06-08T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Montenegro - Financial Sector Policy Based\n            Guarantee Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This document describes EUR60 million\n            (US$79.2 million equivalent) Financial Sector Policy Based\n            Guarantee (FSPBG) to Montenegro in support of a\n            comprehensive banking sector reform program. The objective\n            of the operation is to support the authorities' efforts\n            to strengthen the banking system and increase its resilience\n            to possible future shocks by continuing to undertake\n            sectoral policy reforms and system restructuring. The\n            specific objectives of the Government's reform program\n            are to: (i) strengthen systemic risk monitoring and the\n            crisis management framework, (ii) address banking sector\n            vulnerabilities, (iii) complete the restructuring of Prva\n            Banka, (iv) enhance depositors' confidence, and (v)\n            further improve the regulatory framework for the banking\n            system. The program supported by the FSPBG has been\n            implemented primarily by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and\n            the Central Bank of Montenegro (CBCG). The FSPBG will be\n            used to leverage significant private sector resources, with\n            only 60 percent of principal risk covered, or roughly 50\n            percent of the cash flow risk for investors, in a\n            transaction targeting EUR100 million. The FSPBG-supported\n            bank loan will likely cost Montenegro around 5-6 percent,\n            generating a savings of as much as 4 percent per annum over\n            the life of the loan. Gradual economic recovery and external\n            adjustment ensued in 2010-2011. In this period, growth\n            averaged about 2.5 percent per year. The 2011 growth was\n            broad-based, supported by improving terms of trade and a\n            good tourist season. Banks are completing their\n            recapitalization efforts and focusing on decreasing their\n            liquidity risk exposures by trying to raise more local deposits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Montenegro - Financial Sector Policy Based\n            Guarantee Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Montenegro - Financial Sector\n            Policy Based
