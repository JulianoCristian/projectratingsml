The Tenth Highway\n            Project focused primarily on the lesser-developed areas of\n            the country and included five borrowers - Kosovo,\n            Montenegro, Macedonia, Vojvodina and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The\n            Eleventh Highway Project helped maintain the impetus\n            established by the previous Seventh, Eighth and Ninth\n            Highway Projects on improvements to key sections of the\n            Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH). The Tenth and Eleventh Highway\n            Projects were both implemented during a period of structural\n            adjustment which involved a substantial reduction in the\n            level of expenditures on roads. The Tenth Highway Project\n            introduced a sector-lending approach which provided some\n            flexibility in adjusting to the reduced level of funds and\n            in redefining priorities. Some of the lessons learned\n            included: 1) Despite up to a two-year delay in the\n            completion of most items, most of the road improvement\n            programs was completed as originally planned; 2) In\n            hindsight, the Bank should have coordinated the disbursement\n            of co-financing funds with its own disbursements on the\n            project; 3) As in previous projects, equipment procurement\n            was delayed because of difficulties in obtaining import\n            licenses and a substantial part of the allocation for\n            equipment under the Eleventh Project was cancelled; and 4)\n            Closer attention might have been paid to design standards at\n            appraisal and revisions might have been introduced during\n            the SAP discussion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Tenth and Eleventh Highway Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Tenth and Eleventh\n            Highway Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/09/724910/yugoslavia-tenth-eleventh-highway-projects","projn":"Highways X -- P009185,Highways XI -- P009188","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,ICT Policy and Strategies,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Municipal Financial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Information and Communication Technologies,Urban Development","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960924212049"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Information and Communication Technologies,Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,airports,Arterial\n            Roads,auditing,bottlenecks,Civil\n            Works,congestion,Construction,corridor,current prices,Daily\n            Traffic,debt,depreciation,Engineers,Equipment\n            Procurement,exchange rate,Exchange Rates,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,fuel,gravel,gravel roads,Highway,Highway\n            Projects,highway safety,highways,inflation,inland\n            waterways,institutional development,international\n            traffic,lanes,now accounts,oil prices,primary\n            roads,Programs,ram,range,Rate of Return,Regional Office,Road\n            Construction,road infrastructure,road investment,road\n            maintenance,Road Network,road rehabilitation,Road\n            Safety,road tolls,Road traffic,road user\n            charges,Roads,route,routine\n            maintenance,safety,savings,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,tolls,Traffic,Traffic Growth,traffic\n            lanes,traffic levels,traffic volumes,Transport,Vehicle\n            Operating Costs,vehicle registration,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,airports,Arterial\n            Roads,auditing,bottlenecks,Civil\n            Works,congestion,Construction,corridor,current prices,Daily\n            Traffic,debt,depreciation,Engineers,Equipment\n            Procurement,exchange rate,Exchange Rates,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,fuel,gravel,gravel roads,Highway,Highway\n            Projects,highway safety,highways,inflation,inland\n            waterways,institutional development,international\n            traffic,lanes,now accounts,oil prices,primary\n            roads,Programs,ram,range,Rate of Return,Regional Office,Road\n            Construction,road infrastructure,road investment,road\n            maintenance,Road Network,road rehabilitation,Road\n            Safety,road tolls,Road traffic,road user\n            charges,Roads,route,routine\n            maintenance,safety,savings,taxation,Technical\n            Assistance,tolls,Traffic,Traffic Growth,traffic\n            lanes,traffic levels,traffic volumes,Transport,Vehicle\n            Operating Costs,vehicle registration,vehicles"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","repnb":"6430"},"724006":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1979/03/724006/yugoslavia-tenth-highway-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1979/03/724006/yugoslavia-tenth-highway-project","new_url":"1979/03/724006/yugoslavia-tenth-highway-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/10/18/000178830_98101902321432/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/10/18/000178830_98101902321432/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"1678","docdt":"1979-03-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2000-10-18T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Tenth Highway Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Tenth Highway Project provides for\n            direct participation by the Bank in a 3-year (mid-1979 to\n            mid-1982) slice of the 1979-85 highway development programs\n            of the five participating Republics/Provinces.
