Lessons of broad applicability to\n            Bank-financed projects suggest that in countries with\n            limited natural resources, but with a highly literate\n            population, making the development of human resources and\n            the development of new technologies a priority, can deliver\n            dramatic results: improved management skills, combined with\n            new technologies can enable companies avoid bankruptcy, can\n            improve market focus, collaborate effectively with foreign\n            partners, and, improve quality standards for exports.\n            Nonetheless, it is important to tailor management training\n            programs to company size and category of management. Lessons\n            of specific applicability to private sector development in\n            Moldova suggest that participating companies have shown they\n            are willing to pay for training, and there appears to be\n            substantial potential for training on a commercial basis. In\n            addition, there is likely to be a sizeable market for\n            quality management certifications, particularly for\n            enterprises targeting export markets. Thus, management\n            training programs can be a viable means for Moldova to\n            regain access to foreign markets, find more reliable\n            suppliers, and forge joint venture partnerships."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova - Second Private Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - Second Private Sector\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/09/6320208/moldova-second-private-sector-development-project","projn":"MD-Psd 2 -- P035811","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Small Scale Enterprise,Banks & Banking Reform,Primary Education,Enterprise Development & Reform,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Industry,Education","count":"Moldova","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20051003100726"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Other industry","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Finance and Financial Sector Development,Information and Communication Technologies,Industry,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actual cost, auditing, Banking sector, basic\n            skills, Bidding, business development, business environment,\n            business organization, classroom, company, competitors,\n            computer skills, consulting services, curricula, economies\n            in transition, employment, enterprise development,\n            enterprise support, entrepreneurs, Exchange Rate,\n            executives, expansion, firms, foreign companies, foreign\n            enterprises, foreign markets, foreign partners, Human\n            capital, importance of management, information systems,\n            Institutional Development, international markets, Joint\n            Stock Company, joint ventures, leasing, legislation,\n            licensing, management assistance, management capacity,\n            management techniques, management training, managerial\n            skills, Managers, marketing, media, micro enterprises,\n            operating costs, partnership agreements, performance\n            indicators, present value, private companies, private\n            enterprise, private enterprises, privatization,\n            Productivity, profitability, Project management, quality\n            assurance, radio, realism, reforms, return on equity,\n            Service delivery, small enterprises, Software development,\n            state enterprises, Suppliers, Technical Assistance,\n            telephone lines, television, Theory of Constraints, Total\n            Quality Management, training centers, training programs,\n            transport, wages,"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF029691-PHRD-PRIVATE SECTOR DEV.
