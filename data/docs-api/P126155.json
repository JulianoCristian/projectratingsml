Some lessons learned included:\n            the government's strong political will, as exemplified\n            by the self-imposition of hard and bold economic reforms\n            despite intrinsic political risks associated with such\n            reforms, was key to the overall success of this operation.\n            Alignment with government priorities and incremental\n            dialogue are necessary ingredients for rapid policy changes.\n            Strong coordination with development partners (DPs) avoids\n            duplication and harmonize results framework.
