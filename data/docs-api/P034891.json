Key lessons learned include: 1) It\n            was demonstrated that large scale projects can be used to\n            address village level needs at considerable speed, and that\n            villages are able to be the subjects of development instead\n            of the object of development. 2) The Kecamatan Development\n            Project pilot implementation took as much effort as a full\n            project. Thus, the team has become wary of the usefulness of\n            pilots. 3) Independent monitoring cannot be relied upon to\n            detect problems quickly for corrections on the way, at least\n            when local monitoring capcity is weak and foreign experts\n            are costly, as in Indonesia. 4) Involving the audit agency\n            during project preparation is useful, to avoid the agency\n            later requiring documents that are not foreseen in\n            innovative project designs. 5) It is worth reviewing the\n            methodology for using the SUSENAS (household expenditure\n            survey) data in the estimation of poverty incidences in\n            Indonesia. 6) In terms of infrastructure: a) bridges built\n            by the public works department should be inspected more\n            regularly; b) sanitation system for rural areas should be\n            looked at carefully, since such construction needs parallel\n            education to be fully effective, and such education is\n            costly; and c) since faucets available for water systems are\n            of poor quality, it may be better to do without them and use\n            local approaches."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
