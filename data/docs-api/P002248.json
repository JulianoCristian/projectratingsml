The main objective of the credit was to support the\n            Govenmment's Structural   Adjustment Program (SAP)\n            aimed at restoring macroeconomic and financial equilibrium,\n            enhancing  economic competitiveness and creating the\n            conditions for sustained growth and poverty reduction. The\n            SAC I intended to help create an enabling investment\n            environment based on economicliberalizationa, reducedr ole\n            of the State, and the more efficiental location of public\n            resources.The credit was to lay the foundation for economic\n            recovery by promoting output and exportsgrowth and\n            diversification and thus to lead the country on the path of\n            sustained economic growthand human resource development. The\n            Bank was well aware of the risks it was running during these\n            particularly difficult times, to the point that it even\n            asked to associate RPFrepresentatives in the negotiation of\n            the SAC. The SAC I got off to a good start and the reform\n            agenda it supported remains largely valid. Its\n            objectives,however,were not met becauseo f the devastatingi\n            mpact of the civil war on Rwanda's\n            economic,political,and social environment and the\n            authorities' failure to associate the people with the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Structural Adjustment Credit"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Structural Adjustment

Specifically, the credit\n            will support measures to: (i) establish and maintain a\n            competitive exchange rate and a more liberal foreign\n            exchange allocation and trade regime; (ii) liberalize\n            domestic trade, simplify and reduce the regulatory\n            environment; (iii) alleviate institutional and production\n            constraints in key sectors (coffee, and energy); (iv)\n            establish a process of public expenditure programming; (v)\n            provide a satisfactory social \"safety net\" within\n            the framework of an agreed public expenditure program that\n            is consistent with a sound macroeconomic framework; and (vi)\n            initiate policy reforms dealing with taxation, labor\n
