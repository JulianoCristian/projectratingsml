Some lessons learned includes: creation of\n            enabling environment for effective and safe provision of\n            heating services is important for ensuring sustainability of\n            project achievements. Well targeted, demand-driven\n            output-based capital subsidies can be effective but timely\n            implementation of such a scheme requires early preparatory\n            work and flexibility of procurement. Implementation of\n            credit lines is successful when the funds are allocated\n            transparently, financing terms are commercially determined\n            and there is competition among the Participating Financial\n            Institutions (PFIs). The on-lending funds were not earmarked\n            for PFIs, which resulted healthy competition among financial\n            institutions. Further, the PFIs had freedom to determine the\n            lending terms for the sub-loans while assuming full credit\n            risk, which helped the PFIs to develop their own due\n            diligence skills required for provision of heating\n            sub-loans. Energy efficiency measures coupled with\n            rehabilitation of heating systems substantially increase the\n            sustainability of heating investments. The schools, where\n            basic energy efficiency measures were implemented in\n            addition to rehabilitation of the heating systems saw\n            significant decrease of their energy bills. This contributes\n            to sustainability of safe and clean heating given rising\n            natural gas prices. Collective heating solutions may be hard\n            to implement even if those are the least-cost option. The\n            ability of communities for self-mobilization when dealing\n            with heat service providers is overestimated. Consumers\n            often assign higher value to their autonomy and ability to\n            make decisions independently and, thus, prefer individual\n            heating solutions even if those are more expensive than\n            collective heating option. This is particularly noticeable\n            in communities with mixed income levels, where service\n            standard expectations are different."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Urban Heating Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Urban Heating Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15571900/armenia-urban-heating-project","projn":"AM-Urban Heating Project -- P057880","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Environment,Energy Production and Transportation,Housing & Human Habitats,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Science and Technology Development,Energy,Urban Development","count":"Armenia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20111222012425"},"subsc":"General education sector,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Housing construction,General energy sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Science and Technology Development,Energy,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accidents, air pollution, apartment\n            buildings, apartments, approach, availability, boiler,\n            boiler efficiency, boiler house, boiler houses, boilers,\n            burners, Burning Gas, Burning Gas Fuel, Capacity building,\n            Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, chemical plant, cities,\n            coal, cogeneration, combustion, combustion air, communities,\n            convection, Cooking, cost of electricity, cost of gas,\n            deforestation, description, District Heating, district\n            heating system, district heating systems, Domestic gas,\n            Drafting, efficiency potential, electrical safety,\n            electricity, electricity generation, electricity supply,\n            electricity tariff, electricity tariffs, emission, emission\n            reductions, emissions, energy audit, energy bills, energy\n            consumption, energy crisis, Energy Efficiency, energy\n            efficiency investments, energy efficiency project, Energy\n            Law, energy sector, energy service, energy service\n            companies, energy supply, engineering, engineering design,\n            Environmental Assessment, environmental costs, environmental\n            health, environmental impacts, environmental issues,\n            Environmental Management, equipment safety, equipment\n            suppliers, explosions, fans, fire, flexibility, flue gases,\n            fuel, fuel types, fuels, furnaces, gas, gas boilers, gas\n            consumption, gas costs, gas distribution, gas distribution\n            network, gas imports, gas pipes, Gas price, gas prices, gas\n            supply, gender, Global Environment, Global Environment\n            Facility, greenhouse gas, Heat, heat input, Heat Sector,\n            Heat Supply, heating equipment, heating fuels, heating\n            system, heating systems, Home Owner, hospitals, hot water,\n            hot water supply, households, Housing, Housing construction,\n            housing for the poor, hydropower, Improving Energy\n            Efficiency, injuries, Kilowatt Hour, lighting, low-income\n            households, marginal cost of electricity, natural gas,\n            natural gas prices, natural gas supply, natural gas tariff,\n            natural gas use, Natural Resources, nuclear power, nuclear\n            power plant, oil, operating costs, pilot projects,\n            pipelines, pipes, poisoning, Pollution, Pollution\n            management, Power, power demand, power sector, Pressure,\n            provision of heat, public buildings, Quality Assurance,\n            renewable energy, renewable energy projects, Renewable\n            Resource, Renewable Resources, residential buildings,\n            safety, safety issues, safety nets, safety regulations,\n            safety standards, sanitary conditions, solid fuels, space\n            heating, targeted subsidies, technicians, temperature,\n            trainings, urban areas, urban centers, urban households,\n            urban poor, urban population, valves"}},"owner":"Energy (ECSEG)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025128-PHRD-POWER & GAS\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJ.(BANK-EXEC.),TF025754-PHRD: POWER & GAS\n            RESTRUCTURING PROJ.
