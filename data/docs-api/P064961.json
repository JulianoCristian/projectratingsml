Some of the\n            lessons learned included: 1) the delegated contract\n            management arrangement is well-suited to mitigating capacity\n            constraints in a post-conflict environment. Showing peace\n            dividends in a post-conflict environment requires swift\n            implementation of programs while ensuring that fiduciary\n            requirements are met. Delegated contract management\n            arrangements using streamlined and transparent procurement\n            procedures and faster payment methods of contractors have\n            proved to be very efficient in delivering quick results on\n            the ground ; 2) demand-driven selection through\n            participatory arrangements of communities'\n            infrastructure needs is most suited to address social\n            cohesion and sustainability of services in post-conflict\n            environments. With a social fabric very fragmented as a\n            result of years of conflict and the persistent perception of\n            Government unfairness in allocating public resources, a\n            demand-based approach to the selection and financing of\n            community infrastructure needs is appropriate to ensure\n            transparency in resource allocation and strengthened social\n            cohesion, while at the same time improving the prospects for\n            sustainable operation of financed facilities. However, a\n            proper mechanism to ensure equitable distribution of\n            sub-projects is needed to avoid project concentration in the\n            capital city and a few major urban centers; and 3) short\n            term employment creation is critical in post-conflict\n            environments. Public works projects using labor-intensive\n            technologies can address high unemployment levels and also\n            the revenue-generating needs of conflict-affected groups\n            such as single women, ex-combatants, returnees and refugees."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Burundi - Public Works and\n            Employment Creation

It\n            analyzes the institutional, judicial and regulatory\n            framework, as it relates to environmental management in\n            Burundi, followed by a description of negative environmental\n            effects, and measures to minimize those effects. It is\n            expected that soil erosion, and sedimentation will occur, as\n            well as flooding. As a result, water discharges will\n            increase, aggravated by poor drainage systems, thus\n            affecting health, and hygienic aspects among the population.\n            However, it is expected that the new long lasting roads will\n            improve traffic and transportation, and prod economic\n            growth, through increased commercial private initiatives\n            promoting local products, thus outweighing negative impacts.\n            Measures to mitigate negative impacts include: soil erosion\n            protection, taking into account natural slopes to\n            appropriately discharge rain waters, and in turn prevent\n            flooding, and, installation of sewerage collectors for\n            wastewater discharges, with special attention to the quality\n            of materials to be utilized; re-vegetation, and\n            re-forestation will be implemented, to control river\n            flooding as needed; aquatic species will be introduced for\n            reproduction as needed, while river flows will be protected\n            by forbidding waste disposals, and swimming; traffic signals\n            will be installed, and, periodic inspections will be\n            conducted on construction sites to enforce environmental measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Projet des Travaux Publics et de\n            Creation d'Emplois : evaluation environnementale"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi \u2013 Projet des travaux\n            publics et de cr\u00e9ation d\u2019emplois : \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/05/729361/burundi-projet-des-travaux-publics-de-creation-demplois-evaluation-environnementale","projn":"BI-Public Works And Employment Creation\n            Project -- P064961","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Burundi","authors":{"authr":"HYDROPLAN"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00121301580227"},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Water supply,Roads and highways,Health,General education sector,Sub-national government administration","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Public works;\n            Employment generation; Rural roads; Institutional framework;\n            Legal & regulatory framework; Environmental management;\n            Soil erosion; Sedimentation; Floods; Wastewater collection;\n            Rainwater catchment; Drainage systems; Sewerage; Health\n            aspects of biological diversity; Sanitation; Hygiene;\n            Commercial performance indicators; Transportation planning;\n            Economic benefit; Productivity; Effluents; Vegetative\n            propagation; Reforestation; Aquatic resource management;\n            Waste disposal; Traffic regulations; Signals; Safety\n            measures; Monitoring & evaluation; Inspection"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"E403"},"facets":{}}}
