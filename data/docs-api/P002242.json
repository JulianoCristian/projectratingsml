Given the post-conflict\n            constraints, sustainability remains uncertain. The lessons\n            spell out, that even though the project was instrumental in\n            transferring resources to, and restructuring of the\n            education sector, the complex project design did not take\n            into account the weak institutional capabilities following\n            the genocide, instead, project objectives should have been\n            scheduled to follow technical, and implementation capacity\n            levels, once acquired. Although sensible intent, and\n            commitment by the Government to restore resources to\n            education existed, implementation affected the quality, and\n            management activities in the sector. It is suggested that in\n            post-conflict situations, where substantial changes occur,\n            project restructuring, in agreement with the Government,\n            should take place, as well as an assessment of ownership,\n            and commitment, followed by an institutional capacity\n            assessment, and, performance indicators to measure progress,\n            should be redefined.
