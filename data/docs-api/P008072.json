The project\n            includes the construction of three hyroelectric power\n            plants, rehabilitation of existing diesel engine generating\n            plants, extension of subtransmission and distribution\n            facilities, a loss reduction program, a training program and\n            engineering/consultant services. The project will reduce the\n            country's dependence on imported fuels by about 34,500\n            barrels of fuel per year, resulting in foreign exchange\n            savings equivalent to US$1,300,000 annually.  It will supply\n            a reliable and efficient source of power for the\n            country's development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines - Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines -\n            Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/04/741690/st-vincent-grenadines-power-project","projn":"VC-Hydro Power I (Sdr-4 -- P008072","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy and Poverty Alleviation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Public Sector Economics,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"St. Vincent and the Grenadines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980203114602"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to Electricity,Accounting,accounting\n            standards,audits,biogas,Central Planning,charcoal,commercial\n            energy,construction,Cost Analysis,covers,Debt,diesel\n            engines,Distribution Losses,distribution systems,electric\n            energy,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            sales,Electricity Services,Electricity Supply,electricity\n            theft,electrification,employment,Energy Balance,energy\n            consumption,energy policy,Energy Resources,energy\n            sources,Engineering,engineers,engines,Environmental\n            Aspects,expenditures,fire,fuel,fuel cost,fuel\n            prices,fuels,generating\n            plant,generators,heating,hydroelectric plants,hydroelectric\n            power,hydroelectric power plants,imports,Income,Income\n            Taxes,insurance,kerosene,kilowatt hour,manure,marginal\n            costs,mechanics,new power plant,Oil,Oil Equivalent,peak\n            demand,PetroLeum,petroleum products,power demand,power\n            generating plants,power generation,Power Plant,Power\n            Sector,precipitation,Public Works,Rainfall,reservoirs,Rivers,savings,Streams,tax,taxation,wind-power,wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"Access to Electricity,Accounting,accounting\n            standards,audits,biogas,Central Planning,charcoal,commercial\n            energy,construction,Cost Analysis,covers,Debt,diesel\n            engines,Distribution Losses,distribution systems,electric\n            energy,Electricity,electricity consumption,electricity\n            sales,Electricity Services,Electricity Supply,electricity\n            theft,electrification,employment,Energy Balance,energy\n            consumption,energy policy,Energy Resources,energy\n            sources,Engineering,engineers,engines,Environmental\n            Aspects,expenditures,fire,fuel,fuel cost,fuel\n            prices,fuels,generating\n            plant,generators,heating,hydroelectric plants,hydroelectric\n            power,hydroelectric power plants,imports,Income,Income\n            Taxes,insurance,kerosene,kilowatt hour,manure,marginal\n            costs,mechanics,new power plant,Oil,Oil Equivalent,peak\n            demand,PetroLeum,petroleum products,power demand,power\n            generating plants,power generation,Power Plant,Power\n            Sector,precipitation,Public Works,Rainfall,reservoirs,Rivers,savings,Streams,tax,taxation,wind-power,wood"}},"owner":"Caribbean Countries CMU (LCC3C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"4854"},"facets":{}}}
