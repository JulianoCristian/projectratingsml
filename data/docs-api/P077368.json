Ratings for the First Municipal Development\n            and Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            low; Bank performance was moderately satisfactory; and\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory.\n            Ratings for the Second Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization Project were as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was low; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included from the\n            project: in providing assistance for the reform of any\n            sector municipal in this case-Bank and Borrower need also to\n            help ensure that information systems are adequate for\n            implementing the reforms and for monitoring progress. In the\n            case of these three projects, information on municipal\n            finances and on the economic performance of sub-project\n            investments was sparse. Georgia's situation in this\n            regard could be improved by the greater use of municipal\n            experiences of other countries. Political volatility\n            provides unusual challenges and opportunities for Bank\n            supervision. It calls for more thorough documentation than\n            normal, detailing all actions agreed between Bank and\n            Borrower. It also requires greater oversight of project\n            financial management. In the case of Georgia, it did provide\n            opportunities for the Bank to act as valued and stable\n            interlocutor in times of change. Major political and\n            economic transition, while offering opportunities for\n            reform, may slow down progress with municipal reform in\n            particular, as national governments work to establish the\n            effectiveness of their central control. When municipal\n            management is very weak overall, it makes sense to work\n            first with stronger and creditworthy municipalities that are\n            most likely to succeed. In Georgia, the national government\n            could recognize and foster these municipalities as models of\n            good practice and sources for inspiration and technical\n            assistance for others to learn from."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Municipal Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation Project: First Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization Project;

Some lessons learned included: in absence of a\n            law on local budget, signing municipal development\n            agreements (MDAs) between MDF and borrowing local self\n            governments (LSGs) proved to be crucial, especially when\n            arrears/default occurred and some legal actions had to be\n            taken. Loan portfolio management should include a receivable\n            aging analysis method, whose monthly monitoring could inform\n            MDF on the status of arrears. Immediate actions by MDF to\n            respond to arrears and defaults are crucial. A soft stance\n            may encourage other borrowers to default themselves. In the\n            meantime ministry of finance should not bail out any\n            defaulter. Very careful consideration should be given during\n            project design to define 'realistic' cost\n            recovery. Full cost recovery is impossible for several\n            municipal infrastructure investments, e.g. local roads\n            rehabilitation, street lighting, wastewater and drainage.\n            Consideration should be given instead, in such cases, to\n            efficiency and savings in operation and maintenance cost.\n            Unexpected changes in the government's structure and\n            policy may be an opportunity to be seized by the task team\n            to improve project implementation and ensure the new\n            government's commitment to ownership of the project. By\n            the same token, unexpected new donors' support emerging\n            during implementation could be an opportunity, but it\n            requires considerable effort by the Bank team and government\n            to ensure coherence o f the overall support being provided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Second Municipal Development and\n            Decentralization
