Three major lessons\n            can be derived from this project: (i) a strong commitment is\n            needed at the national level, and not only at the local or\n            regional level, since policies such as fuel pricing have a\n            major impact on the emission and/or reduction of Greenhouse\n            Gases (GHG); (ii) the Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n            goals of reducing GHG were not the first priority of the\n            Municipality of Tehran, which was more interested in\n            developing methods to reduce particulate matter in the\n            atmosphere; in the future, more attention should be paid to\n            the needs of the recipient, and they should be recognized in\n            the project design; and (iii) there is a need to collect a\n            large quantity of data over as long a period as possible, to\n            model both the traffic patterns in the city, and the air\n            pollution dispersion patterns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Tehran Transport Emissions Reduction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iran - Tehran Transport Emissions\n            Reduction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/731705/iran-tehran-transport-emissions-reduction-project","projn":"IR-Tehran Trnpt Em.

GHG abatement\n            can be achieved through a variety of measures, all of which\n            will produce some reductions in local air pollution.  The\n            GEF project will identify a schedule of measures, to achieve\n            a target air quality improvement, which serve both\n            objectives at the lowest incremental cost for GHG abatement.\n            Such a schedule of GHG abatement maximizing measures, and\n            the associated incremental costs, will provide decision\n            makers with the information necessary to design a program of\n            local air pollution abatement that simultaneously, and cost\n            effectively, addresses global warming concerns.
