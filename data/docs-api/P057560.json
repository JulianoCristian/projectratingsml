In\n            light of these impressive ratings, lessons specifically\n            favor implementing projects through a single agency with\n            very strong leadership, learning from similar efforts in\n            other countries, and, benefiting from constructive\n            criticism. This last comment stems from the issue that\n            initial poor service quality, and staff corruption were not\n            easily accepted, but persuasion of the veracity of facts\n            fostered decisive remedial action, which, in the end, having\n            dealt with these problems proved successful. Automation is\n            not necessarily a precondition for providing effective\n            services, since the move to an aggressive client-friendly\n            service proved essential in increasing system efficiency,\n            and user acceptance, more so than the transition to a fully\n            computerized environment. Most importantly, effective and\n            equitable property tax administration, can only be attained\n            through a systematic cadastre that effectively captures\n            inclusion in the property tax base, and eliminates\n            widespread tax evasion. In addition, by proactively\n            involving the private sector through competitive\n            contracting, and surveying work, substantial efficiency\n            gains and cost savings were generated. Lessons also note\n            that property valuation can be undertaken within the\n            titling, and registration institution, provided the latter\n            is not the property-tax collecting agency as well."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia -

The project consists of three\n            components. The first component will support establishing a\n            nationwide common Information and Registration Centers\n            (IRCs) network for a secure registration of real estate\n            parcels and associated rights. It will include training\n            staff in the new system procedures; designing, prototyping,\n            and establishing a computerized title registration\n            management information system in 25 IRCs with linkages to\n            information systems across the cadastral network; and\n            further equipping local IRCs. The second component will\n            support surveying land to produce cadastral maps. It will\n            provide financing to equip and furnish the Mapping Center;\n            contract satellite imagery and finance global positioning\n            system grid enhancement work; and support the non-labor\n            operating costs of the Surveying and Mapping works.
