The lessons learned indicate that system\n            technology and software are constantly evolving. Therefore,\n            a proper project design should include budgetary space for\n            system and technological changes and the possibility for\n            upgrades should be built into the design. Project\n            indicators, as defined at entry, were not specific enough to\n            provide meaningful results. Within the first year of\n            implementation the SIGMA system was linked to a parallel\n            broader institutional reform project. While we normally\n            emphasize the importance of having strong and constant\n            technical leadership by the government, it is equally\n            important to minimize turnover by

critical mass of\n            public entities; and 2) building up a strong public auditing\n            function able to collaborate with private sector auditing\n            firms to continuously review and evaluate financial\n            performance and integrity of operations conducted by public\n            sector entities. The project's components are: 1)\n            implementing decentralized integrated financial management\n            systems (IFMS), developing institutional capacity to improve\n            project auditing, accounting, and reporting;  2) IFMS public\n            sector-wide integration through installing telecom links,\n            linking both the decentralized and centralized financial and\n            budget reporting systems; 3) modernizing the budget\n            transactions payments systems via a private sector banking\n            network; 4) disseminating integrated financial management\n            operations and implementing public financial regulations; 5)\n            project operating costs covering administrative and project\n            management staff, travel,
