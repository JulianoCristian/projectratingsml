Some lessons learned included:\n            project implementation periods should allow for possible\n            delays. Even though land acquisition arrangements seemed\n            relatively straightforward at appraisal, unforeseen local\n            political issues that are common in a Pacific island context\n            stalled implementation of physical investments.

Transport impediments (particularly\n            following a major natural disaster such as the 2009 Tsunami)\n            can delay travel of project staff to beneficiary communities\n            and can hold up implementation support missions.

The project is anticipated to have\n            minor and localized environmental impacts coming mainly from\n            civil works activities related to the construction of\n            cyclone-resistant housing units and retrofitting of\n            partially damaged housing and buildings. The types of\n            environmental issues that may arise relate to land clearing\n            for site preparation, movement of workers, and materials to\n            and from project sites, and proper disposal of waste and\n            debris. The reconstruction of the housing units will take\n            place within the existing village boundaries and the units\n            are designed to be low-cost but cyclone resistant. They are\n            to be constructed mainly of legally imported timber and\n            materials, requiring only light civil works. Some\n            construction of the housing will occur in newly prepared\n            sites and will involve some clearance of bush and vegetation\n            for foundation preparation. Land has been identified and is\n            primarily a plantation land of mixed use."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environmental impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga - Post Tsunami\n            Reconstruction Project : environmental assessment (Vol. 3) :\n            Environmental impact assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/11/17031808/tonga-post-tsunami-reconstruction-project-environmental-assessment-vol-3-environmental-impact-assessment","projn":"TO-Tonga Post Tsunami Reconstruction -- P120595","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Sanitation and Sewerage,Roads & Highways,Water and Industry,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"Tonga","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20121204005412"},"subsc":"Housing construction,Sewerage,Ports, waterways and shipping","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"bitumen, cement, concrete, conservation,\n            construction, construction wastes, contaminants, cracking,\n            debris, demolition, drainage, drainage system, dust,\n            Environmental Impact Assessment, environmental impacts,\n            Environmental Management, environmental practices,\n            Environmental Protection, erosion, Excavation, excavators,\n            filtration, fishing, Framework, income, injuries, Jetty,\n            linings, loading, main roads, mangrove, manholes, mechanical\n            equipment, nitrogen, Noise, nutrients, particulates,\n            pipelines, plasticity, pollution, ponds, pumping, pumping\n            stations, quarrying, rain, rainwater, rainwater harvesting,\n            recycling, road construction, road construction materials,\n            road rehabilitation, road surface, road surfacing, roads,\n            routes, sand, sanitation, sanitation facilities, sea,\n            sealing, seawater, sediment, Sedimentation, sediments,\n            septic tanks, silt, site investigation, soil erosion, solid\n            waste, speed, storm water, storm water runoff, structures,\n            surface runoff, suspended solids, tar, traffic, traffic\n            flow, traffic noise, transportation, trees, trucks, unpaved\n            roads, Vegetation, vehicle emissions, vehicles, vibration,\n            washing, waste, Waste Management, waste water, Wastes, water\n            harvesting, water pipes, Water pollution, water pumps, Water\n            Quality, water requirements, Water Supply, water supply\n            system, water system, wells, wind, winds"}},"owner":"Pacific Islands Sustainable Dev (EASNS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"trustfund":"TF097099-Tonga Post Tsunami","repnb":"E2554"},"16825786":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/10/16825786/tonga-tonga-post-tsunami-reconstruction-p120595-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-02","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2012/10/16825786/tonga-tonga-post-tsunami-reconstruction-p120595-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-02","new_url":"2012/10/16825786/tonga-tonga-post-tsunami-reconstruction-p120595-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-02","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b0816e5fd9","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0816e5fd9","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/EAP/2012/10/12/6BAADDAC906D694585257A9600088A5E/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/ISR0Disclosabl012201201350091996894.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/EAP/2012/10/12/6BAADDAC906D694585257A9600088A5E/1_0/Rendered/PDF/ISR0Disclosabl012201201350091996894.pdf","credit_no":"IDAH6280","docdt":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Tonga -

This project restructuring\n            involves adding 'Force Account' as an additional\n            procurement method for civil works and amending the\n            Financing Agreement to allow this. The civil works for this\n            project will be taking place on Niuatoputapu, an isolated\n            island approximately 330 nautical miles from the capital of\n            Nuku'alofa. In accordance with paragraph 3.8 of\n            'Guidelines: procurement under International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Loans and\n            International Development Association (IDA) Credits\"\n            published by the Bank in May 2004 and revised in October\n            2006 and May 2010, it is justified to use Force Account\n            where qualified private construction firms are unlikely to\n            bid for these small works contracts at reasonable prices,\n            and as this is an emergency operation, prompt construction\n            is necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga - Post Tsunami\n            Reconstruction Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15643353/tonga-post-tsunami-reconstruction-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"TO-Tonga Post Tsunami Reconstruction -- P120595","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Post Conflict Reconstruction,Hazard Risk Management,Housing & Human Habitats,Natural Disasters,Disaster Management","teratopic":"Environment,Urban Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Tonga","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20120119000501"},"subsc":"Housing construction,Public administration- Water, sanitation and\n            flood protection,Information technology","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Urban Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"documents, emergency operation, houses,\n            IBRD, International Development, natural disasters,\n            Post-Tsunami Reconstruction, project Financing, Project\n            Management, RECONSTRUCTION, TSUNAMI, Tsunami Recovery"}},"owner":"Pacific Islands Sustainable Dev (EASNS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"trustfund":"TF097099-Tonga Post Tsunami","repnb":"66437"},"facets":{}}}
