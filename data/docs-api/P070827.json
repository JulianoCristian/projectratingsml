Some lessons learned\n            included: Addressing the needs of marginalized populations.\n            By the inclusion of the indigenous education sub-component\n            in the Project was a learning opportunity for both the\n            Secretariat of Education and Culture (SEC) and the Bank. The\n            results of this component are considered very positive, both\n            for the indigenous communities involved, as well as in the\n            perceptions of local officials of improvements in\n            relationships between these communities and local\n            government. The impact study found that having a certified\n            principal in a school was positively correlated with higher\n            achievement. The idea of certification was also positively\n            received by all groups interviewed as part of the\n            beneficiary study. Providing ongoing certification\n            opportunities for new principals and other education\n            specialists may be an effective way to improve education\n            quality. Accelerated classes. Given Bahia's staggering\n            rates of age-grade distortion, the inclusion of accelerated\n            classes in the Project could not have been more relevant. As\n            demonstrated in the impact studies, these classes also made\n            a significant contribution towards improvement in this\n            regard. With age-grade distortion in the fundamental cycle\n            now estimated as standing at 45.6 percent, continuing with\n            accelerated classes deserves serious consideration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Phase Bahia Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Second Phase Bahia\n            Education

The program\n            complements numerous Government actions and focuses on\n            improving fundamental' and secondary school quality,\n            increasing access to secondary schools, and improving system\n            management. The program is designed as a 5 year effort; The\n            development objectives of the Second Bahia Education Program\n            are to: (a) improve fundamental and secondary school\n            outcomes, as measured by improvements in dropout and\n            promotion rates and student performance on standardized\n            tests; and (b) increase access to secondary school, as\n            measured by an increase in secondary enrollments. There are\n            three project components with several subcomponents.\n            Component 1 supports the improvement of school, quality by\n            assuring minimum operational standards for schools,\n            supporting the implementation of school development plans,\n            financing school improvement projects, implementing\n            accelerated classes, expanding Gestar (a curriculum and\n            in-service teacher training program developed by Fundescola\n            and aligned with the new National Curriculum parameters),\n            and improving indigenous education. Component 2 expands\n            access to education by planning and providing additional\n            school places through construction of additional classrooms.\n            Component 3 strengthens educational management by\n            strengthening educational assessment, strengthening\n            educational management institutions, financing project\n            management, and funding

This Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP)\n            specifically looks at the legislation concerning the\n            approach to indigenous peoples' education, its\n            diagnosis, directives, objectives, and goals.

This environmental assessment (EA)\n            first considers the site selection criteria, and the\n            technical specifications for each architectural project, to\n            comply with the country's environmental regulations,\n            and the Bank's operational directive on the\n            environment. Considerations include adversity on critical\n            natural habitats, the potential for land flooding, adversity\n            to local populations as a result of construction and damage\n            to existing infrastructure - electricity, water supply,\n            access roads - as well as surface, and groundwater\n            contamination. The criteria for environmental mitigation,\n            outline measures as follows. Sites selection would avoid\n            flood prone areas, and as possible natural habitats, in an\n            effort to preserve biodiversity, and natural water flows.\n            The standard school designs will address sanitation in\n            particular, to include toilets, and adequate sanitary\n            measures. Protective barriers will be installed to contain\n            soil erosion, and divert water flows which might potentially\n            endanger construction, based on hydrological studies, and\n            geological data conducted for the implementation of each\n            specific project. Drainage systems will be surveyed to\n            monitor rainwater, surface, and groundwater to contain\n            erosion, and in addition, as sanitary control, and hygiene\n            monitoring to prevent water contamination, while septic\n            tanks will also be installed. Construction contracts would\n            include precautionary clauses to ensure adequate disposal of\n            debris, including toxic residues, oil spillage, and\n            hazardous chemicals. Vegetation propagation will be\n            practiced following construction, to maintain and increase\n            the local flora and fauna, and to control erosion, and air\n            pollution, but in accordance with strict selection of native\n            species, adequate to local soil nutrients. Finally,\n            architectural choices will respect cultural heritage sites,\n            and, contractors should inform the archaeological\n            authorities, should discoveries of historical or cultural\n            value occur."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Bahia Education (Phase 02) Project\n            : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Bahia Education (Phase\n            02) Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/10/2077730/brazil-bahia-education-phase-02-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"BR-Bahia Education Project (Apl) - Second\n            Phase -- P070827","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02120704011325"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Primary education,Secondary education","theme":"Education for all,Education for the knowledge economy","lang":"Portuguese","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Environmental\n            regulations; Secondary education; Primary education;\n            Indigenous populations; School construction; Natural\n            habitats; Flood damage prevention; Soil erosion; Waste\n            management; Waste disposal; Hazardous waste disposal; Oil\n            spills; Wastewater collection; Drainage systems; Water\n            discharge & flow; Rainwater; Surface waters; Groundwater\n            protection; Cultural heritage; Vegetative propagation"}},"owner":"Education - GP (GEDDR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Latin America & Caribbean"}},"majtheme":"Human development","repnb":"E633"},"facets":{}}}
