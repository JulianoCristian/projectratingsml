To\n            support longer-term policy reforms it is worthwhile to have\n            a multi-year program design that allows some flexibility in\n            the program. A DPL program series instead of a single DPL\n            provides an opportunity for continued policy dialogue and\n            support reforms over longer time. A DPL that is focused on a\n            small number of related sectors, such as Human Development,\n            provides a comprehensive and cohesive approach for the Bank\n            to support a Government's reform agenda. A limited\n            sector DPL is also easier to manage for the Bank than a DPL\n            with many sectors. Such a cohesive approach intensifies the\n            policy dialogue in a sector which could lead to better\n            quality benchmarks and coherent reforms. Despite the higher\n            cost related to it, the upfront investment in analytical\n            work and policy notes in the preparation phase can help to\n            set the reform framework and embed a DPL program in a\n            country's national strategy. Investment lending\n            projects can further supported these analytical works.\n            Strong management support from the Bank at the beginning of\n            an operation with Senior Management participating in the\n            DPL1 preparation phase can help to get the buy-in from the\n            Government and country unit for a DPL program.\n            Decentralization of head quarter staff to the field ensures\n            a close and continued dialogue with the Government and other\n            partners throughout the program series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -

document describes the\n            second phase of three planned Social Sectors Institutional\n            Reform (SIR) - Development Policy Loans (DPL II). The series\n            has been designed to support the Government of Bulgaria\n            (GOB) to meet some of the challenges associated with\n            European Union (EU) accession in the case of DPL I and\n            post-accession - DPL II and III. The DPL series is\n            supporting the adoption and implementation of policies to\n            (i) increase employment and lay the foundations for\n            long-term productivity growth by providing incentives for\n            job creation and improving quality of education; and (ii)\n            promote fiscal sustainability through efficiency gains in\n            social sectors. Many of the policies are well placed to\n            improve access to and quality of social services in the\n            medium term, a secondary objective of the program. The\n            actions supported by the DPL series are expected to\n            contribute in the medium term to increased speed of\n            convergence with EU policies and standards, enhanced\n            competitiveness through increased skills of the labor force\n            and better investment climate, more efficient health,\n            education, and social assistance systems, and a more\n            equitable access to basic social services. The focus of this\n            DPL series reflects the Government's social sectors and\n            productivity agenda and its strategic use of multilateral\n            organizations support to implement reforms and improve\n            outcomes in sectors that remain outside the sphere of\n            intervention of the EU."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Second Social Sectors\n
