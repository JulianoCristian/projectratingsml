The project only achieved some of its\n            objectives, institutional development was modest,\n            sustainability is unlikely, and the performance of the Bank\n            was marginally satisfactory while the Borrower's was\n            unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, Government commitment should be firm and\n            clear of ambiguities. Second, the number of parties involved\n            in the processing of appraisal reports should be minimized\n            to avoid delays. Third, the project appraisal capacity of\n            institutions assisting industrial enterprises should be\n            strong enough to prevent unrealistic assumptions. Fourth, if\n            commercial banks will be utilizing IBRD financing, their\n            capacity to analyze long-term investments and their economic\n            impact will need to be reinforced. Fifth, the Bank should\n            make sure that the Borrower has adequate capacity to manage\n            this type of project. Sixth, the level of Bank supervision\n            should be evenly maintained throughout project\n            implementation in order to respond immediately to rising\n            problems. Finally, given the fact that a revised audit on\n            this project has not yet been sent to the Bank, the Bank\n            should use its leverage to impress upon the Borrower the\n            importance of complying with this financial covenant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -
