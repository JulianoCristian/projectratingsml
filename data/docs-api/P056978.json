agricultural land in\n            fifteen provinces for small, and medium size irrigation, and\n            for integrated rural development, through improved\n            infrastructure, and agricultural development measures. While\n            positive impacts such as reduction of water losses, improved\n            flood protection, and reduced incidence of water borne\n            diseases as a result of better access to clean water, are\n            expected, negative impacts will occur. These refer to\n            potential, increased agro-chemical pollution; ecological\n            impacts due to increased water diversion affecting wetlands,\n            and other types of non-agricultural vegetation; potential\n            uses of irrigation canals for non-agricultural water supply,\n            or as a sewer in rural settlements; potential erosion caused\n            by road construction; uncontrolled waste disposal; and, risk\n            of groundwater resources exploitation. The impacts will be\n            mitigated by the following measures: 1) extension, and\n            training on irrigation performance management, and sound\n            fertilizer application will be integrated under technical\n            assistance components; 2) ecological impacts due to\n            increased water diversion will undergo monitoring on\n            vegetative practices; 3) water discharge measurement points\n            will be constructed, to monitor better maintenance, and\n            cleaning of irrigation flows; 4) drainage measures, and\n            soil/water conservation practices will control water quality\n            as per technical guidelines; and, 5) groundwater/aquifer\n            capacity will be assessed ex-ante, and effective pumping\n
