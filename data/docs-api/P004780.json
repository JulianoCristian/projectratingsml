The Land Reform Areas Project received\n            unsatisfactory ratings in the area of development outcome,\n            in light of its limited relevance to the objectives of\n            sustainable land management and poverty reduction, as well\n            as its poor economic rate of return. Institutional\n            development impact is rated negligible because management\n            and planning capacity of the implementing agency was not\n            enhanced by the project. The audit rates borrower and Bank\n            performance as unsatisfactory, primarily because both\n            parties performed poorly during the identification and\n            preparation phase, creating a project that responded weakly\n            to the development needs of Thailand. The Second Land\n            Titling Project received an outcome rate of satisfactory\n            rather than highly satisfactory because the project failed\n            to meet its original titling target. Furthermore it did not\n            grapple with broader land administration issues, notably the\n            unclear boundaries between private and public land. OED\n            finds Bank performance and borrower performance to have been\n            satisfactory rather than highly satisfactory, because\n            institutional weaknesses could have been more fully\n            addressed, coordination with other land administration\n            agencies could have been stronger, and more provision could\n            have been made for evaluating the impact of land titling on\n            poverty reduction and natural resource management. The\n            following lessons were gleaned from the projects: land\n            titling and land reform efforts need to be grounded in an\n            overall rural development strategy that weighs the relative\n            cost and likely impact of various alternatives for reducing\n            rural poverty and improving natural resource management; the\n            success of systematic adjudication in Thailand owes much to\n            circumstances that may not apply elsewhere; there is a need\n            to provide farmers in the Land Reform Areas with efficient\n            land surveying services leading to full (NS4) title, define\n            and mark forest boundaries to enable the titling of\n            contiguous lands, and share land information data more\n            effectively between government agencies; and the case for\n            freeing up land in state hands should be carefully considered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Land Reform Areas
