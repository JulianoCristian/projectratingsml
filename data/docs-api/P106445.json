Some lessons learned included: per\n            capita payments and results-based financing (RBF) are\n            efficient policy tools to generate incentives for delivering\n            health services to communities in rural areas. When\n            preparing indicators, there should be a balance between the\n            technical and administrative objectives. Private sector\n            providers can be partners in the delivery of health services\n            to the poor in rural areas, but this requires the Ministry\n            of Health (MOH) to perform a strong supervision role.\n            Integrated and automated information systems can facilitate\n            per capita payments, RBF, and sector management. The\n            verification process used information systems that were not\n            well integrated and required an extensive manual review.\n            Coordination among lending institutions is key to reduce the\n            burden on public offices and avoid potential financial gaps\n            and service provision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama -
