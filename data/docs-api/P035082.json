Project sustainability is\n            rated likely. Overall, World Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory, as is Borrower performance, based on the\n            performance of the two participating banks and the\n            Government during preparation and of the banks during\n            implementation. Lessons learned included the following: The\n            state of Poland's economy changed, pertinent laws and\n            regulation changed, and the banking/municipal sectors\n            changed. The availability of more flexible lending\n            instruments and more flexibility to switch from one\n            instrument to another could have enabled the Bank and the\n            Borrower to react more quickly to changing circumstances.\n            Although desirable from a developmental point of view,\n            requiring the banks to enter into complex cost recovery\n            computations or conditionality and require full cost\n            recovery was not workable in an environment where full cost\n            recovery for wastewater investments is currently rarely\n            achieved. Also, a commercial bank line of credit was an\n            inappropriate mechanism for requiring procurement procedures\n            that differed from those of the procurement law."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Municipal Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Municipal Finance

in Poland.  To this end, the project\n            pursues the following two inter-related objectives.  First,\n            it will provide long-term financial resources to commercial\n            banks for municipal lending in the infrastructure sector.\n            And second, it will help the banks identify and prepare a\n            sustained pipeline of viable investment projects, backed by\n            creditworthy towns or local utilities. The project will\n            consist of a single-currency loan to each of two selected\n            commercial banks.  The loans finance a program of long term\n            subloans issued by these banks to municipalities and\n            revenue-earning municipal service enterprises.  The project\n            will also promote the channeling of donor-provided technical\n            assistance resources (through the Municipal Development\n            Agency-MDA) to market participants including: 1)\n            municipalities, in the areas of project preparation and\n            financial management; 2) banks, for appraising municipal\n            credit and structuring robust loan security arrangements;\n            and 3) the MDA to strengthen its continuing role as a\n            facilitator of municipal investment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
