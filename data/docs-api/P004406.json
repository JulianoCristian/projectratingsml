Some lessons learned\n            includes: project duration. The project combined two\n            operations in one over a 17-year period. While this approach\n            may have had advantages from the point of view of\n            bureaucratic processing, it also had disadvantages. Notably,\n            closure of first phase when the investment sub-projects were\n            completed would have allowed a formal valuation of the first\n            phase implementation experience which could have contributed\n            to second phase design. Furthermore, having been designed as\n            part of an ongoing project rather than a self-standing new\n            operation, second phase did not benefit from a formal World\n            Bank appraisal, this might have uncovered some of the design\n            weaknesses that plagued second phase implementation.\n            Furthermore, due to the long duration of the project, the\n            evaluation of the earlier implementation years was\n            significantly constrained by staff changes in the relevant\n            Government agencies and the Bank, and changes in the\n            enterprises that benefitted from the Project. Monitoring\n            outcomes vs. outputs. A limited number of the planned\n            project outputs were achieved and contributed to the\n            achievement of the Global Environment Objective (GEO) during\n            second phase. The Philippines was reaching the objectives\n            set for the project mainly due to factors external to the\n            project, while a number of planned project outputs were\n            either not being generated or poorly generated.\n            Implementation progress monitoring. The project demonstrated\n            that the Bank could have better assessed implementation\n            progress. Voucher system design and implementation. The\n            experience with the voucher scheme implementation under the\n            project highlighted the need to make sure that financial and\n            time costs for service shops' participation in the\n            scheme are minimal, and a rigorous, adequately funded\n            monitoring system is in place from the very beginning to\n            ensure that no parties in the system engage in abuses, all\n            eligible beneficiaries receive proper equipment and use them properly."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -

The project includes an\n            investment component and a technical assistance (TA)\n            component.  The TA component includes: a) an institutional\n            strengthening project to strengthen the capability of the\n            Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to\n            implement the country ODS phase out program; and b)\n            technical assistance to the financial agent, the Land Bank\n            of the Philippines, to strengthen its capability to appraise\n            and supervise ODS investment projects.  The investment\n            component will support sixteen subprojects in: a) ODS\n            refrigerant recycling; and b) conversion to non-ODS\n            technology in solvents, refrigeration, foam blowing and\n            tobacco puffing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Second Montreal Protocol Ozone\n            Depleting Substances Phase Out Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Second Montreal\n            Protocol Ozone Depleting Substances Phase Out Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/09/734517/philippines-second-montreal-protocol-ozone-depleting-substances-phase-out-investment-project","projn":"PH-Ods Investment Project -- P004406","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Chemical & Petrochemical Industry,Climate Change and Environment,Montreal Protocol,Global Environment Facility","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the Director","teratopic":"Environment","count":"Philippines","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961007102700"},"subsc":"Banking,Agro-industry,Other industry,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Air,Alcohol,aqueous cleaning,carbon,carbon\n            dioxide,CFC,CFC 11,CFC 113,CFC113,CFCs,chemicals,Cleaning\n            Process,CO,cost\n            savings,degreasers,drying,emissions,environmental\n            protection,expenditures,HCFC,hydrocarbons,imports,market\n            prices,Methyl Chloroform,methylene chloride,Montreal\n            Protocol,Natural Resources,negotiations,ODS,OTF,Ozone,Ozone\n            Depleting Potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,Ozone\n            Depleting Substances Phase Out,Ozone Layer,OZONE PROJECTS\n            TRUST FUND,PE,perchloroethylene,polyurethane,present\n            value,PSC,recycling,reducing\n            emissions,refrigeration,retrofitting,solvents,stabilization,tar,trichloroethylene,wastewater\n            treatment,water pollution"},"1":{"cdata!":"Air,Alcohol,aqueous cleaning,carbon,carbon\n            dioxide,CFC,CFC 11,CFC 113,CFC113,CFCs,chemicals,Cleaning\n            Process,CO,cost\n            savings,degreasers,drying,emissions,environmental\n            protection,expenditures,HCFC,hydrocarbons,imports,market\n            prices,Methyl Chloroform,methylene chloride,Montreal\n            Protocol,Natural Resources,negotiations,ODS,OTF,Ozone,Ozone\n            Depleting Potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,Ozone\n            Depleting Substances Phase Out,Ozone Layer,OZONE PROJECTS\n            TRUST FUND,PE,perchloroethylene,polyurethane,present\n            value,PSC,recycling,reducing\n            emissions,refrigeration,retrofitting,solvents,stabilization,tar,trichloroethylene,wastewater\n            treatment,water pollution"}},"owner":"Environmt & Social Devl Sctr Dpt (EASES)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF021931-OTF - PHILIPPINES ODS PHASE OUT\n            INV.
