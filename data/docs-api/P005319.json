Unsatisfactory\n            ratings are assessed as well for both the Bank, and Borrower\n            performances, given the Bank failed to critically assess the\n            actual Government's implementation capacity, and in\n            providing adequate supervision, and, the Government's\n            inadequate support, largely due to frequent changes in the\n            Ministry of Health, and weak capacity, lead to delays in\n            counterpart funding. Lessons learned from the preparation,\n            and appraisal stages, reinforce the need for strong\n            Government commitment, and support particularly for complex\n            project preparation. As well, project design should\n            emphasize on monitoring indicators not limited to\n            quantitative measures, but rather qualitative measures, and,\n            an essential donor coordination should be in place during\n            preparation, particularly as in this case, where financial\n            activities are required. Lessons learned during\n            implementation, emphasize the need for adequate skills mix\n            among the supervision team, to be able to address relevant\n            development objectives, capable of focusing both on inputs,\n            as well as on the outputs: the implementation approach was\n            more of a purely investment project, disregarding the\n            institutional reform components.
