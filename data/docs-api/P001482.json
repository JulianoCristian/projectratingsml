The Andekaleka Project was a major\n            investment which made sense in the federal context of\n            Madgscar's large hydro resources, high oil prices and\n            projected levels of power demand. However, overly optimistic\n            demand projections conveyed a sense of urgency to bring on a\n            large, capital-intensive, indivisible investment. In\n            hindsight, it seems that the Bank may not have fully\n            appreciated the potential difficult that could rise from a\n            combination of conditions prevailing t the project's\n            inception (a) a financing set-up which made it difficult for\n            Bank to supervise, directly, the consultants in charge of\n            the project's execution, (b) parallel financing with a\n            large number of co-lenders, limiting the availability of\n            funds in the case of major changes in the cost estimates,\n            (c) the newness of the Malagasy Electricity and Water\n            Corporation (JIRAMA) as an implementing agency with the\n            conspicuous absence of a financial manager, (d) the lack of\n            agreement on a new tariff structure at the time of Credit\n            approval and (e) a questionable data base for making\n            projections of demand and financial targets. These\n            conditions foreshadowed, to a certain degree, the resulting\n            cost over runs, surplus hydro capacity, and difficulties for\n            JIRAMA in meeting some of the financial covenants of the Credit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
