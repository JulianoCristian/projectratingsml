Some lessons\n            learned included: economic evaluation in a situation where\n            low density populations live in mountainous terrain, the\n            construction costs are high and economic benefits are low.\n            This undermines the application of conventional cost benefit\n            analysis, which focuses on the savings accruing to the\n            vehicles using the roads, or the effects of transport cost\n            reductions on agricultural producers living along the road.\n            Cost effectiveness criteria as a road planning tool is\n            therefore a pragmatic and acceptable approach for ranking or\n            prioritizing roads. Independent monitoring in a global\n            biodiversity 'hotspot' like Bhutan, environmental\n            issues are given at most attention. The independent\n            monitoring body comprising of different agencies proved to\n            be exemplary in achieving the required level of\n            environmental compliance during

The last review concluded that\n            the project was well placed to achieve its development\n            objectives. This paper seeks the approval for restructuring\n            of the project. The following changes to the original\n            project are being introduced: 1) dropping of two outcome\n            indicators given that they were influenced by external\n            factors (e.g. fuel prices, government regulated mule rate);\n            2) changes in the road length component one for new\n            construction by 10km; 3) dropping technical assistance\n            provisions linked to the pilot performance-based maintenance\n            mechanisms under capacity development and implementation\n            support component (component two); and 4) changing the road\n            for Otta-sealing under road access component (component one)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - Second Rural Access\n            Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/10/15499521/bhutan-second-rural-access-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"BT-Bhutan Second Rural Access Project -- P100332","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Roads & Transport,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Housing & Human Habitats,Roads & Highways,Rural Transport","teratopic":"Rural Development,Transport,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Bhutan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20111123224611"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Transport,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"bridges, construction, Department of Roads,\n            description, Districts, Engineer, feeder roads, female,\n            FRAMEWORK, fuel, fuel prices, Human Settlements, length of\n            road, length of roads, PCU, reduction in travel,\n            resettlement, road, Road Access, road infrastructure, road\n            length, road lengths, road projects, Roads, roadworks, RURAL\n            ACCESS, RURAL ACCESS PROJECT, rural transport, rural\n            transport infrastructure, sealing, transparency, Transport,\n            transportation, transportation costs, travel time, villages,\n            walking, walking distance, Work Force"}},"owner":"Transport (SASDT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"61265"},"14347422":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/06/14347422/bhutan-bhutan-second-rural-access-project-p100332-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-09","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/06/14347422/bhutan-bhutan-second-rural-access-project-p100332-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-09","new_url":"2011/06/14347422/bhutan-bhutan-second-rural-access-project-p100332-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-09","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2011-06-13T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2011-06-13T00:00:00Z","docm_id":"090224b080d63b0c","chronical_docm_id":"090224b080d63b0c","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/SAR/2011/06/13/EDEA9B193E3AF309852578AE004DA26D/1_0/Rendered/INDEX/P1003320ISR0Di013201101307974078789.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/SAR/2011/06/13/EDEA9B193E3AF309852578AE004DA26D/1_0/Rendered/PDF/P1003320ISR0Di013201101307974078789.pdf","credit_no":"IDAH2850","datestored":"2011-06-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-06-13T00:00:00Z","volnb":"1","docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Bhutan Second Rural Access Project\n            : P100332 - Implementation Status Results Report : Sequence 09"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - Bhutan Second Rural\n            Access Project : P100332 - Implementation Status Results\n            Report : Sequence 09"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14347422/bhutan-bhutan-second-rural-access-project-p100332-implementation-status-results-report-sequence-09","projn":"BT-Bhutan Second Rural Access Project -- P100332","docty":"Implementation Status and Results Report","count":"Bhutan","authors":{"authr":"Ahmed,A.K.
