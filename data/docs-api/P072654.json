Some lessons learned included: a\n            flexible design (or a process approach) mandates especially\n            a carefully designed and effective monitor and evolution\n            (M&E) system to provide constant and early feedback\n            towards identifying needed implementation adjustments. Where\n            institutional development includes the need for new\n            legislation and regulations, arrangements must be in place\n            to provide for independent qualified reviews of proposals\n            coming out of public-private dialogue, and of draft\n            legislation. In-country Bank staff assigned to an operation\n            should be standard practice when there are significant local\n            capacity constraints. Establishment of a project\n            management/implementation unit within the Government\n            structure may be unavoidable, without over-concern for\n            enclave

There are four project\n            components. The first extends a further line of credit to be\n            offered on commerical terms. The SEP II line of credit will\n            draw extensively upon lessons learned during SEP I (See\n            report no. 20206). Accordingly, the line of credit will be\n            similar in style and function to that in SEP I but will\n            incorporate adjustments to the delivery method, targeting,\n            interest rate, and management processes. In addition to the\n            agri-business sector, viable loan applications from other\n            productive industries such as small-scale carpentry shops,\n            mechanical centers or manufacturing facilities will also be\n            supported. The second component finances business\n            development services, civil service training, and the\n            development of the business enabling environment. The third\n            component funds sub-grants to 13 districts for market\n            rehabilitation, specifically produce and goods market\n            facilities. The fourth component finances consultant\n            services, incremental operating costs, and project\n            implementation unit (PIU) training, as well as other\n            miscellaneous items for the PIU office."},"docna":{"cdata!":"East Timor - Second Small Enterprises Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"East Timor - Second Small\n            Enterprises Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/09/1653712/east-timor-second-small-enterprises-project","projn":"TP-Second Small Enterprises Project -- P072654","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Health Economics & Finance,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Timor-Leste","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02010711081922"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Central government administration,Micro- and SME finance,Other domestic and international trade","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agriculture,capacity\n            building,capitals,civil service,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,Cost Benefit Analysis,credit\n            culture,credit unions,deflation,demonstration\n            effects,development agencies,development strategy,economic\n            growth,economic performance,economic recovery,Economic\n            situation,electricity,employment,Exchange Rate,financial\n            crisis,financial institutions,financial management,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fish,foreign exchange,GDP,health\n            services,income,inflation,informal sector,insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,Key performance\n            indicators,laws,legislation,level of repayment,market\n            distortions,microfinance,Migration,oil,ports,Private\n            Sector,private sector investment,production\n            inputs,productivity,property rights,public sector,public\n            use,regulatory framework,Savings,service delivery,social\n            safety nets,tax,technical\n            assistance,telecommunications,transparency,transport,Unemployment,urban\n            poverty,urbanization,Value added,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agriculture,capacity\n            building,capitals,civil service,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,Cost Benefit Analysis,credit\n            culture,credit unions,deflation,demonstration\n            effects,development agencies,development strategy,economic\n            growth,economic performance,economic recovery,Economic\n            situation,electricity,employment,Exchange Rate,financial\n            crisis,financial institutions,financial management,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fish,foreign exchange,GDP,health\n            services,income,inflation,informal sector,insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,Key performance\n            indicators,laws,legislation,level of repayment,market\n            distortions,microfinance,Migration,oil,ports,Private\n            Sector,private sector investment,production\n            inputs,productivity,property rights,public sector,public\n            use,regulatory framework,Savings,service delivery,social\n            safety nets,tax,technical\n            assistance,telecommunications,transparency,transport,Unemployment,urban\n            poverty,urbanization,Value added,wages"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.
