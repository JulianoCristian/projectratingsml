Lessons learned include: costing of project\n            activities should be based on updated data and targets at\n            appraisal should be based on realistic estimates and not on\n            inaccurate budgets. More comprehensive approach should have\n            been used in improving dam safety including more detailed\n            geotechnical and hydrological investigations to determine\n            the characteristics of the dams and their resistance to\n            earthquakes which can reduce the risk of dam failure\n            substantially. Adequate capacity should be developed and\n            maintained in the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and\n            Consumer Protection (MOAFCP) to deal with dam safety issues\n            of the large number irrigation dams. Dam safety problems\n            were identified during the inventory study but the effort\n            can be lost if there is poor capacity and/or commitment for\n            action. Similarly, the MOAFCP capacity for supervision of\n            civil works should be formally included in the Ministry\n            structure and proper training should be provided to the\n            unit. Also, incentives should be considered to enable the\n            experts to carry out their work beyond the regular working\n            hours to respond to the project needs. The cost of\n            contracted supervision services should be based on\n            competitive basis and not on the fixed regulation of the\n            Government that ignores the required work involved. The\n            transfer of Project Management Unit (PMU) staff and its\n            functions during implementation to the line ministry to\n            create capacity can also fail if there is not a strong\n            commitment to make it work. The transfer had to be reversed\n            in the case of supervision of works. Importance of having\n            the legal framework for irrigation institutions that clearly\n            defines duties and responsibilities to ensure Water Users\n            Association (WUO) sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

Water Resources Management\n            Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This is an environmental assessment for\n            the Water Resources Management Project, which helps Albania\n            increase the contribution of water resources for\n            agricultural production. The irrigation schemes comprising\n            this project are environmentally acceptable with negative\n            impacts either nil or minor. This report discusses  likely\n            these negative social and environmental impacts and the\n            measures proposed to mitigate them, which generally consist\n            of engineering interventions incorporated into the design of\n            the scheme, or modifications to farming practices (through\n            training schemes) to reduce groundwater and drain pollution\n            by agrochemicals. Potential negative impacts caused by the\n            rehabilitation works during construction include\n            disturbance, noise, and dust, and disposal problems. It is\n            proposed to program work to minimize disruption during\n            sowing and harvesting, avoid cultivated areas, and monitor\n            construction activities. Also, these impacts are temporary\n            and will cease when the works are completed. During the\n            operational phase, potential environmental impacts may arise\n            from sediment accumulation in canals, deterioration of water\n            quality downstream and groundwater sources, disturbance to\n            localized ecosystems, and hydrological disturbance (the\n            latter is not expected in any of the six schemes).\n            Mitigations include regularly inspecting and clearing\n            canals, deep ploughing, using water efficiently, maintaining\n            drains, monitoring groundwater levels and salinity,\n            restricting nitrogen application on fields, providing health\n            awareness to farmers, well water sampling (for nitrates,\n            phosphates, and F. coliform bacteria), managing the\n            watershed, and using river training works and inspecting and\n            reporting riverbank erosion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -
