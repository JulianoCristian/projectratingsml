The first focuses on remedying a\n            production shortage by providing new and genetically\n            superior purebred dairy stock, often imported. The second\n            (the operation flood model) involves provision of a reliable\n            market for existing producers. There is overlap in these\n            designs in that both provide for milk processing. The first\n            model includes milk collection, but primarily from its\n            'own' farmers, and the second model includes\n            access to inputs, veterinary services, and crossbred cattle.\n            Despite this overlap, the models are clearly distinct. Only\n            in the case of Turkey was the production strategy\n            unambiguously successful. The Zambian project is of\n            particular interest, since it was designed as a\n            'production' project but implemented as a\n            'marketing' project. The project was appraised on\n            the assumption that crossbred cattle could be freely\n            imported from Zimbabwe. However, the 1980-81 droughts led to\n            a ban on cattle exports from Zimbabwe, and transport costs\n            made it uneconomic to purchase cattle from further a field.\n            This led to a redesign and sharp contraction of the milk\n            production component. Nevertheless, milk collections\n            exceeded the original projections, about half of them from\n            existing small producers. At audit, the five projects that\n            are the subject of this impact evaluation were considered satisfactory."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Karnataka and Rajasthan Dairy\n            Development Projects and the Madhya Pradesh, and First and\n            Second National Dairy Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Karnataka and Rajasthan\n            Dairy Development Projects and the Madhya Pradesh, and First\n            and Second National Dairy Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/06/441906/india-karnataka-rajasthan-dairy-development-projects-madhya-pradesh-first-second-national-dairy-projects","projn":"IN-Agr.Cr.
