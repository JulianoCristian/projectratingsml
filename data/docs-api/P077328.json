Some lessons\n            learned included: the use of adaptable program lending\n            instrument involving investment components may not leave the\n            Bank\u2019s supervision team with enough leverage to link the\n            progress of physical components with the reform milestones.\n            During the course of the project, T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti Devlet\n            Demiryollar\u0131 - Turkish State Railways (TCDD) and Ministry of\n            Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications (MoT) needed\n            more studies and internal consultations to finalize the\n            reform agenda. Implementation structure of the client should\n            be well assessed at the time of project preparation. When\n            the implementing agency has limited experience with\n            procurement of technically complex investments such as\n            signaling, greater Bank provision of technical support and\n            training for the preparation of the bidding documents and\n            the management and supervision of such contracts is\n            advisable. The European Union (EU) technical assistance was\n            considered sufficient at the time of the project preparation\n            to address most of the capacity building and institutional\n            strengthening issues. To ensure that the procurement process\n            excludes firms that routinely underbid and make up the\n            financial gap through change orders, bidder qualifications\n            may include demonstration of successful implementation of\n            comparable projects within the originally bid amount.\n            Signaling projects can potentially be implemented in an\n            effective manner due to their relative simplicity and their\n            limited environmental and social impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
