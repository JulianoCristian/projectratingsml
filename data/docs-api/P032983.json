The overall project outcome\n            was rated satisfactory. This project was the first of its\n            kind both for the Bank and for Spain. It was developed in\n            response to the need to modernize Spanish industry and to\n            introduce new technologies that will improve the efficiency\n            and competitiveness of manufacturing, promote new product\n            development and create new, and technologically advanced\n            industries The major lessons learned from this project are\n            as follows: a) The project was on balance successful, in\n            large part because the timing for technology development\n            investment was appropriate to Spain's level of\n            industrialization, the recent entry into the labor force of\n            a large pool of technical manpower and the need to stimulate\n            increased Research, Development and Engineering (R, D&E)\n            in industry. This demonstrates the importance of appropriate\n            timing for projects of this type. The Center for the\n            Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) has since become\n            a key arm of the government in stimulating industrial\n            technology development. (b) The project was also sensibly\n            flexible in its organizational structure and approach.\n            However, it was initially rigid on procurement and\n            disbursement procedures, the procedures needed\n            modifications, and this was done after an excessive amount\n            of time. In such instances, the Bank should respond more\n            quickly in modifying procedures than was done in this case.\n            (c) The role of CDTI, like similar institutions elsewhere,\n            changed gradually from an agency whose role was primarily to\n            promote technological development as part of the Government,\n            to one whose role became more demand driven and\n            financing-oriented with increased autonomy, as indigenous\n            technological capability grew, and most particularly, as it\n            became clear that Spain will have to compete within\n            technologically advanced Europe."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Spain -
