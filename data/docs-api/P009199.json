After a slow start, the technical\n            assistance commitments undertaken by the Borrowers in\n            respect of institutional strengthening under the Projects\n            were largely met, except for improvements in the management\n            information systems (MIS) components partly due to the\n            existence of obsolete computer systems. The three Projects\n            were successful, to some extent, in meeting their objectives\n            of providing foreign exchange resources to meet priority\n            objectives in the LDRs at a difficult time in the Yugoslav\n            economy. The Projects had limited success in the overall\n            institutional strengthening of the Borrowers. The single\n            most important lesson emerging from the three Projects is\n            that a sound macroeconomic framework is essential for the\n            success of such projects. The Bank was unable to have any\n            significant impact on the critical issues of enterprise and\n            bank ownership and governance, a situation which is now\n            being addressed under the Government's ongoing economic\n            reform program. Other important lessons from the Projects\n            include the need to ensure that adequate monitorable minimum\n            financial performance standards are explicitly covenanted in\n            the loan agreements to reinforce the position of the\n            financial intermediaries vis-a-vis outside influences.\n            Furthermore, while macro-level adjustment operations\n            substantially increase the Bank's leverage in getting\n            the Borrowers' acceptance for major conditionalities,\n            given the short-duration, quick-disbursing nature of such\n            operations, adequate supporting conditionalities need to be\n            built into the investment operations themselves to ensure\n            sustainability of the improvements. Finally, strong\n            prudential supervision through the Central Bank or other\n            appropriate means should be ensured, particularly when there\n            is reason to suspect that the financial intermediaries may\n            be more than usually vulnerable to outside influences."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia -
