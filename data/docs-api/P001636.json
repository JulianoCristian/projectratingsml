In particular, the objectives should\n            have reflected a more realistic vision of what one project\n            could accomplish, given the inherently risky nature of\n            governance reforms, the severly limited implementation\n            capacity of both the central and local governments, and the\n            long time horizon needed for local governments to achieve\n            the capacity to provide and maintain essential service.\n            Project sustainability--that is, sustainable financing for\n            Assembly capital investments, the ability of the Assemblies\n            to sustain these investments through proper operations and\n            maintenance procedures, and the sustainability of the\n            \"enabling framework\" of laws, policies, and\n            institutions for local government development and eventual\n            service provision by the Assemblies. Both Bank and Borrower\n            performances are rated unsatisfactory overall. Some of the\n            lessons learned centered on the need to establish a strong\n            project unit with strong financial and technical skills.\n            Risk assessment and mitigation in project design need to be\n            much more rigorous, including the scaling down of projects\n            if needed. Bank supervision missions need to be critically\n            honest. Building on the points mentioned, projects need to\n            be designed in a performance driven way; this requires the\n            early design, adoption, and implementation of a rigorous\n
