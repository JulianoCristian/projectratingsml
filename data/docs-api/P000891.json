Objectives of the program are\n            two-fold:  to improve pedagogic effectiveness, and to recast\n            the financing of education so that public and private\n            expenditures are cost-effective and affordable within modest\n            growth expectations.  A key feature of the reform program\n            addressing both these objectives is a structural change in\n            the education system, reducing pre-university education from\n            17 to 12 years.  The resources saved through this structural\n            change and a range of cost recovery and cost saving measures\n            will enable access to be expanded at the primary level\n            directly benefitting poorer children in the more isolated\n            regions.  The First Education Sector Adjustment Credit\n            Project will provide the supplemental budget support\n            necessary to launch the reform program.  Funds will be\n            released in three annual tranches following a review of\n            public expenditures on education and implementation of the\n            program to monitor adherence to program objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Education Sector Adjustment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - Education Sector\n            Adjustment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/11/739835/ghana-education-sector-adjustment-project","projn":"GH-Educ.
