These were: (a) to\n            support the improvements in urban sector management and\n            institutional strengthening initiated by the Government of\n            Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) and to reduce the serious deficits in\n            urban shelter, infrastructure and services in the State; and\n            (b) to assist the Central Ganga Authority (CGA) in its\n            efforts to reduce pollution levels in the Ganga River. There\n            were shortcomings in Bank performance. Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was not satisfactory.
