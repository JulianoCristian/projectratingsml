The main lessons\n            learned with implementation of the Project are the\n            following: bottom-up participatory approaches can yield very\n            positive results for education; revenue sharing among levels\n            of Government can foster higher municipal investment for\n            education; interagency coordination can strengthen the\n            implementation of sector policies; institutional\n            strengthening is undermined by frequent changes in human\n            resources; creating organizations to channel participation\n            helps consolidate community and stakeholder participation; a\n            good project framework helps catalyze international\n            resources; Community involvement in the definition of\n            educational needs and priorities and in the control of their\n            achievement guarantees greater sustainability of\n            investments; and an adequate monitoring and evaluation\n

The\n            programs were based on proposals prepared by parents,\n            teachers, and directors of school nucleus.  Second,\n            institutional strengthening will provide training and\n            technical assistance at the nucleus and municipal levels,\n            and provide equipment for District Head Offices.
