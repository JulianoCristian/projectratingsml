priority engineering studies. The project will be\n            executed by three institutions: ELECTROLIMA, ELECTROPERU,\n            AND HIDRANDINA. ELECTROLIMA will be responsible for the\n            largest component of the project comprising the 1982-1986\n            expansion plan for its distribution system, construction of\n            the Yuracmayo dam, three engineering studies and a training\n            program. ELECTROPERU will carry out engineering related to\n            the preparation of the Mantaro transfer project, will\n            receive technical assistance in financial management and\n            will carry out a training program.
