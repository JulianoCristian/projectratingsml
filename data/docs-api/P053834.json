Some lessons learned includes: governments\n            should set priorities in terms of what they are attempting\n            to achieve. Jordan's 2000 privatization law gave\n            sufficient authority for a new Executive Privatization\n            Commission (EPC) to retain external advisors, undertake\n            investor search according to agreed tender procedures, and\n            negotiate privatization transactions-subject to oversight by\n            a high-level government of Jordan (GOJ) privatization\n            committee. The privatization agency must be able to respond\n            quickly to requirements set by external advisors and obtain\n            timely government decisions. Enterprise restructuring, if\n            needed, should be completed prior to privatization. As part\n            of enterprise preparation, the GOJ sought to avoid\n            disadvantaging redundant State Owned Enterprises (SOE)\n            staff. Sector restructuring, development of regulatory\n            frameworks and capacity, labor retrenchment, and transaction\n            support are extremely expensive."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan -
