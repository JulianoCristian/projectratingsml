Some lessons learned\n            includes: in the case of Sierra Leone the Governance Reform\n            and Growth (GRG) series helped to consolidate and entrench\n            the local councils which were re-established after a 30 year\n            absence. This resulted from a strong shared understanding\n            between Government and many external stakeholders about the\n            importance of re-establishing government presence around the\n            country, and the role that the lack of such a government\n            presence played in the conflict. For a post-conflict country\n            in a fragile, state-building process, the benefits of a\n            programmatic approach to policy operations are likely to\n            outweigh the risks, particularly the opportunity to\n            revaluate progress before each successive operation, if the\n            timing of the approval process of donors for budget support\n            is not well aligned with the government's budgetary\n            process, the program support for poverty reduction risks\n            shortfalls due to uncertainty in funding. Embedding policy\n            reforms in the Government's reform agenda instills\n            greater government ownership of the program, diminishing the\n            risk of delays or shortcomings in achieving objectives. For\n            an operation that involves coordinating actions in several\n            sectors, outside the authority of the main implementing\n            agency, the achievement of targets is more likely if\n            disaggregated into a set of measurable indicators with\n            clearly-defined administrative responsibilities in a given\n            ministry, department or agency. In a country short of\n            management capacity, a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation (M\n            and E) framework is not likely to be sustainable without\n            intensive donor inputs and supervision. Also the requirement\n            for monthly reports to be provided by the Ministry of\n            Finance may have been onerous and excessive, discouraging\n            any reporting."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic Governance\n            Reform and Growth Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone - Programmatic\n            Governance

sustainable development in the\n            context of its Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The\n            operation includes reform measures in support of the\n            following development objectives: (i) preserve the fiscal\n            space needed for poverty reduction; (ii) promote efficiency,\n            transparency and accountability in the use of public\n            resources through enhanced public financial management and\n            governance; and (iii) improve the investment climate by\n            ensuring the provision of electricity in a fiscally\n            sustainable manner.  The development policy operation, the\n            last in a programmatic series of three, aims to support the\n            authorities' efforts, in the midst of the current\n            global crisis, to maintain a sound and sustainable fiscal\n            stance and to protect the development objectives set forth\n            in Sierra Leone's second PRS. The PRS emphasizes\n            private sector growth to reduce poverty, backed by public\n            investments in infrastructure and the delivery of basic\n            social services, along with continued improvements in the\n            quality of governance. The operation takes place at a very\n            challenging time, as the Sierra Leonean authorities deal\n            with an unfavorable global environment, which sharply\n            contrasts with its generally positive post-conflict\n            prospects. The global economic down-turn has weakened\n            economic prospects for 2009 and is putting pressure on the\n            fiscal position. The mining sector has been particularly\n            hard hit with declines in world market prices, delayed\n            investments, and scaled back production. Remittances are\n            also projected to fall in 2009. Real Gross Domestic Product\n            (GDP) growth is projected to slow to 4 percent compared to\n            an earlier forecast of 5.5 percent, and revenues are\n            expected to fall short of the original budget target mainly\n            because of declining exports and imports and weaker income growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Third Governance Reform and\n
