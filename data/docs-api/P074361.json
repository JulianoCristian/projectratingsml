There were a number of\n            important lessons learned on project sustainability under\n            the Georgia Social Investment Fund (GSIF) II Project\n            covering the: (i) the need to focus on local-self governing\n            structures and to develop an effective framework (structure,\n            systems and procedures) to facilitate interaction between\n            community members and local self-government authorities.\n            This was essential in helping move communities and local\n            self-governments from a dependency culture focused on\n            short-term interventions to one that recognizes that\n            communities can have the ability to improve their living\n            conditions and prospects for sustainable development through\n            the active involvement of community members; (ii) the\n            importance of focusing on implementation arrangements\n            incorporating institutional mechanisms aimed at building\n            organizational capacities of communities; (iii) the need to\n            ensure good quality of works though improved procedures and\n            an enhanced monitoring and supervision framework; (iv) the\n            need to devote greater attention to operations and\n            maintenance of micro-projects by ensuring adequate\n            demand-orientation and community participation in the choice\n            of subprojects and through local-capacity building; and (v)\n            the importance of institutionalizing the administration of\n            micro-projects in the government structure to create\n            effective linkages between the central government and local\n            communities, ensure effective service delivery through\n            qualified staff in the government structure, and thereby\n            sustain project activities beyond project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Second Social Investment Fund

participating poor communities apply for,\n            manage, and use micro-projects in a sustainable manner; and\n            c) participating poor communities benefit from improved\n            social and economic infrastructure and related services. To\n            that end, the project will place an explicit emphasis on\n            strengthening the interaction between local government level\n            and citizens in improving the quality of life in\n            communities. It will undertake capacity building and asset\n            management at the local government level. At the community\n            level, it will develop community mobilization and advocacy\n            skills to strengthen self-reliance and self-help mechanisms.\n            There are three components: 1) capacity building at local\n            community and self-government levels, through training in\n            management and administrative skills; 2) identification,\n            development and implementation of community based\n            micro-projects; and 3) project management costs. While the\n            project will be nationwide in scope, the primary target\n            group will be the poor communities in peri-urban areas,\n            rural towns and

framework\n            of the Second Social Investment Fund Project, which identify\n            environmental impacts resulting from the project\n            implementation, review the country's environmental laws\n            and regulations, and assess mitigation measures. The\n            infrastructure works concerning primary health, and\n            education facility micro-projects, will potentially induce\n            contamination from waste materials, hamper drainage systems\n            and water quality, due to polluted effluents and hazardous\n            wastes, as well as impact air quality, disturb natural\n            habitats, and affect the social environment. Measures to\n            mitigate these effects call for the protection of soil\n            surfaces, through a daily clean-up and control in\n            construction sites, which includes the provision of adequate\n            waste disposal services; drainage systems should be\n            inspected regularly, taking into consideration a special\n            disposal of oil, and hazardous materials, and, include as\n            well adequate sanitation, and waste disposal systems;\n            construction will be restricted to daytime working schedules\n            to reduce noise disturbances; and, degradation of natural\n            vegetation should be avoided as possible by considering\n            alternative sites, and re-vegetation practices following\n            construction. Works regarding water supply, small scale\n            irrigation, wastewater and sewage, and, waste management\n            micro-projects should consider mitigation as follows: soil\n            degradation should be protected during construction through\n            vegetative propagation and physical stabilization of soils;\n            preventive water contamination should consider a minimal\n            distance from human settlements and agricultural areas, and\n            appropriate drainage; waterborne diseases should be taken\n            into account, particularly through appropriate design,\n            testing, and training provision; water quality degradation\n            should be prevented through the control of agrochemical\n            uses, monitoring, and
