          selected mines. The financial, technical and administrative\n            base of CADETAF would be strengthened, so that it can\n            improve and expand its services to artisanal miners, and lay\n            the basis for future expansion of small-scale mining\n            activities. The project consists of: (a) acquisition by\n            CADETAF of mobile lead and zinc concentrators, and of a\n            crushing and grinding unit; (b) provision to miners against\n            credit of mining equipment and works; (c) establishment of a\n            training mine; (d) development of CADETAF's financial\n            and management systems and of its financial organization;\n            and (e) execution of geological and socio-economic studies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Pilot Project For Small-scale\n            Mining Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Pilot Project For\n            Small-scale Mining Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/02/726026/morocco-pilot-project-small-scale-mining-project","projn":"MA-Small Scale Mining Eng -- P005403","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Sanitation and Sewerage,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Montreal Protocol","teratopic":"Environment","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912535628"},"subsc":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,Air,artisanal\n            activities,artisanal miners,Artisanal Mining,Artisanal\n            Mining Sector,artisanal production,balance of\n            payments,barites,Base Metals,beneficiation,Centrally Planned\n            Economies,chemicals,co,cobalt,Concentrates,copper,Debt,Developed\n            Countries,drilling,Ecology,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,employment,expenditures,explosives,gas,geological\n            surveys,Income,informal miners,Insurance,iron,iron ore,labor\n            force,lead smelter,local authorities,Local\n            miners,manganese,mechanized mining,metals prices,Mine\n            Safety,mine workers,mineral development,mineral\n            exploitation,Mineral Production,mineral products,Mineral\n            Sector,mineralization,minerals,Mines,mining\n            activities,mining areas,mining companies,mining\n            engineer,mining equipment,mining methods,mining\n            operations,Mining Project,mining rights,MINING SECTOR,mining\n            tradition,Net imports,oil,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,phosphate,Phosphates,plastics,private\n            mining,producers,Productivity,pumps,remote\n            regions,salt,scrap,shafts,silver,small mines,Small\n            Scale,small scale mining,Small-scale,Small-Scale\n            Mines,Small-scale Mining,stabilization,Streams,underground water,ZINC"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,Air,artisanal\n            activities,artisanal miners,Artisanal Mining,Artisanal\n            Mining Sector,artisanal production,balance of\n            payments,barites,Base Metals,beneficiation,Centrally Planned\n            Economies,chemicals,co,cobalt,Concentrates,copper,Debt,Developed\n            Countries,drilling,Ecology,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,employment,expenditures,explosives,gas,geological\n            surveys,Income,informal miners,Insurance,iron,iron ore,labor\n            force,lead smelter,local authorities,Local\n            miners,manganese,mechanized mining,metals prices,Mine\n            Safety,mine workers,mineral development,mineral\n            exploitation,Mineral Production,mineral products,Mineral\n            Sector,mineralization,minerals,Mines,mining\n            activities,mining areas,mining companies,mining\n            engineer,mining equipment,mining methods,mining\n            operations,Mining Project,mining rights,MINING SECTOR,mining\n            tradition,Net imports,oil,Ore\n            Reserves,ores,phosphate,Phosphates,plastics,private\n            mining,producers,Productivity,pumps,remote\n            regions,salt,scrap,shafts,silver,small mines,Small\n            Scale,small scale mining,Small-scale,Small-Scale\n            Mines,Small-scale Mining,stabilization,Streams,underground water,ZINC"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"3393"},"facets":{}}}
