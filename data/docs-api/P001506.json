The Borrower's\n            performance can be rated as satisfactory for preparation,\n            implementation and covenant compliance, and highly\n            satisfactory for operation. The International Development\n            Association (IDA) performance on this project was highly\n            satisfactory at the identification stage, and satisfactory\n            or somewhat less so in preparation assistance, appraisal,\n            and supervision. Negative factors were the lack of\n            Government counterpart funds, a certain lack of interest by\n            the Board of Directors, and deficiencies in management.\n            Regarding the procurement assistance component, its\n            implementation was affected mostly by the difficulty of\n            reconciling differences in points of view between IDA and\n            the Borrower on the reform of procurement regulations and\n            procedures. The following lessons can be learned from this\n            operation: To facilitate implementation and monitoring, it\n            is advisable to avoid projects with a mix of components of\n            different kinds and with different implementing agencies.\n            The procurement component was attached to the project as the\n            Bank felt that it was important at that time and this was\n            the only project within the foreseeable time horizon.\n            However, the project's experience demonstrates the\n            inadvisability of attaching unrelated components without\n            sufficient preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Accounting and Management\n            Training Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Madagascar - Accounting and\n            Management Training Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/09/733717/madagascar-accounting-management-training-project","projn":"MG-Acc.
