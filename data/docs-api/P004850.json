impacts were substantial. Lessons\n            primarily suggest that a stable political environment is\n            helpful for successful implementation of macroeconomic, and\n            structural reforms - given the risk of erosion of political\n            support was minimal, and reversals due to political changes\n            were unlikely. Second, the broad-based consensus, and strong\n            government commitment permitted a timely implementation,\n            while the presence of capable, and committed officials, was\n            key to overcoming some of the emerging difficulties in\n            implementation, especially in state-owned enterprises (SOE),\n            and trade reform, as well as in the Joint-Stock Bank\n            restructuring. Third, the availability of technical\n            assistance grants from donors, and strong Bank team support\n            were extremely useful, particularly true of process reforms\n            of the sort undertaken in SOE and banking reforms, which\n            need a lot of handholding within institutions. Fourth,\n            effective donor coordination is crucial in a transitional\n            economy: capacity to implement structural reforms can easily\n            be overwhelmed by the relatively large number of donors,\n            therefore, it is critical that donors coordinate their\n            activities closely, and minimize duplication of efforts, an\n            aspect well handled,

Government, and support implementation of Vietnam's\n            poverty reduction strategy as summarized in the Interim\n            Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). The project will\n            promote faster growth, and poverty reduction by improving\n            private sector development, thereby generating jobs, and\n            higher wages. Restrictions shall be removed on private entry\n            in remaining sub-sectors; the legal framework shall be\n            unified for enterprises; and, access to, and private\n            transactions in land-use rights will be facilitated.\n            Moreover, state enterprises reform will improve the\n            efficiency, and free-up fiscal resources for the poverty\n            reduction program, by accelerating equity, and by amending\n            the legal framework to improve transparency. Additionally,\n            social safety nets will be expanded for state-owned\n            enterprises workers displaced by reform. Restructuring the\n            banking system should reduce the risk of financial crisis,\n            which could otherwise undermine poverty reduction efforts,\n            through improved legal, regulatory, and supervisory\n            framework, promoting prudent banking. The expansion of\n            labor-intensive exports should integrate the country with\n            the world economy, by removing restrictions, and reducing\n            tariffs. Nonetheless, resistance to reform, higher than\n            estimated reform costs, and, weak human capacity, are risks\n            to be considered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Viet Nam - Poverty Reduction
