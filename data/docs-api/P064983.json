Ratings for the Housing Sector Development\n            Policy Loan Project for Morocco are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            Algeria project include: seeding housing reform by focusing\n            upon a selected bottlenecks-such as in bank processing of\n            mortgage loans and in the registration of property titles\n            cannot guarantee that the reform will take root. Even if\n            they constitute necessary conditions for reform, they must\n            be calibrated with other actions to ease the supply of new\n            housing, for example-to achieve the well functioning markets\n            promised by the housing sector reform. Housing sector\n            reforms need to be calibrated and synchronized in order to\n            succeed. In Algeria, improving the origination and\n            processing of mortgage loans went ahead even though demand\n            for such loans was weak. In such cases, reform measures\n            might need to be scaled back or delayed. Lessons learned\n            from the Morocco Project include: policies and programs\n            aimed at achieving cities without slums need to treat slums\n            as a dynamic feature of urban development. Without\n            appropriate urban planning and land use controls, the\n            formation of new slums can overwhelm the achievements of\n            upgrading and redeveloping existing ones. For housing reform\n            to be sustained, it is important to modernize and\n            consolidate the institutional framework for taking the\n            reform forward through a powerful and financially sound\n            agency such as Al Omrane that enjoys full government\n            support. Sector reform is more likely to succeed if\n            harnessed to a flagship program that is well understood by\n            all stakeholders and beneficiaries, such as the Villes sans\n            Bidonvilles (Cities without Slums Program) (VSB) program in Morocco."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Mortgage Finance Technical\n            Assistance Project and Morocco - Housing Sector

Some lessons learned included: The lack of\n            responsiveness from the Ministry of Housing slowed\n            considerably the project implementation. The\n            inter-ministerial steering committee put in place to ensure\n            participation and cooperation between the different\n            ministries was only adopted at the end of the project and\n            therefore did not have the intended catalyzing effect\n            intended. The important lesson here is that during the risk\n            evaluation of a project, the team should also anticipate the\n            possible break-down of the mitigating measure and revise\n            them in order to make them as full-proof as possible. The\n            quantitative data required for the impact evaluation of the\n            project was extremely difficult to obtain. As a result, the\n            impact evaluation can only be qualitative, therefore at\n            times subjective. It is important for project teams to\n            remember that while controlling spending is very important,\n            it is equally important to respond to the needs of the\n            borrower and provide know-how and assistance where and when\n            required. Finally, project teams should keep in mind that if\n            all the blocks are important in the building of a structure,\n            the sequence in which they are laid is also vital to ensure\n            the soundness of the construction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Mortgage Finance Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Mortgage Finance\n
