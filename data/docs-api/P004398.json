The project had a difficult\n            start, because shortly after loan negotiations, a new\n            government took power. This note concludes that the evidence\n            is inconclusive whether the Bank should have persuaded the\n            government to restructure the Loan rather than cancel it.\n            There were debates within the Bank to consider\n            restructuring. However, evidence was accumulating that the\n            new government's lack of capacity, governance, and\n            common strategy with the Bank (despite some committed\n            government staff within the sector) would have led to\n            cancellation by the Bank in due course. In addition, the\n            government clearly indicated to the Bank that it did not\n            want further Bank involvement in Papua New Guine's\n            forest sector, and requested cancellation of the loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea -

The\n            project has four main components. The first develops and\n            implements a process whereby landowners will become more\n            aware of options in using their forests. Its three\n            sub-components comprise consultative activities to improve\n            landowner access to information and discussions of\n            development options prior to any land-use decisions;\n            improved processes and systems for landowner representation\n            and organization to allow improved resource decisionmaking\n            will be developed and implemented; and policy and\n            legislative development. The second component establishes a\n            Conservation Trust Fund with GEF support, and develops a\n            co-financing strategy. The third component augments the\n            efforts of the forest authority and other institutions\n            involved in sustainable management of the country's\n            forests. It improves capacity specifically by improving\n            forest operations, inspection, and monitoring; forest\n            management planning; and expanding activities that maintain\n            forest production as well as ecological potential. The\n            fourth component provides technical assistance for\n            environmental assessment and monitoring while building\n            apacity within the Office of Environment and Conservation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea -
