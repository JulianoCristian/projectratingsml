Under the project, the Government\n            of Aceh awarded a sub-project contract to Organization A and\n            another non-governmental organization, Organization B.\n            Shortly thereafter, the Government of Aceh and Organization\n            B concluded a Sub-Grant Agreement (the Sub-Grant Agreement),\n            which contained the implementation details of the\n            Sub-Project.
