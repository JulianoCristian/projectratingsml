The objectives of the project were to help\n            Government of Nicaragua (GON) sustain its poverty\n            alleviation efforts, and maintain social cohesion during the\n            period of economic adjustment, until line ministries could\n            strengthen their institutional capacities, and complete\n            policy reform programs. To the extent feasible, the methods\n            of operation, procedures, and experience of Social Emergency\n            Investment Fund (FISE) would be transferred gradually to\n            social ministries to help them improve efficiency and equity\n            of service deliver. Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) FISE succeeded\n            through the effective and efficient application of standard\n            SIF procedures and methods, which are well-tested and\n            proven, and owes its success to good management and the\n            ability to attract donor financing; (ii) the successful\n            implementation of social objectives and new work areas\n            depends on institutional commitment, effective technical\n            assistance that responds to FISE's special needs\n            productive partnerships with the social ministries, and the\n            correct assessment of the impact of additional\n            considerations on institutional capacity; (iii) the transfer\n            of FISE's experience and methods of operation and\n            procedures to social ministries to help them improve their\n            efficiency and equity of service delivery was only partially\n            achieved, because of uncertainties regarding the transfer\n            and inadequate analysis of the objectives of the ministries\n            with regard to how FISE could be of assistance; and (iv)\n            Nongovernmental Organization (NGOs) have to play a\n            substantial role in facilitating community involvement\n            throughout the project cycle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Social Investment Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Social Investment\n            Fund
