Some lessons\n            learned included: the implementation arrangements used\n            brought together a number of State Secretariats in Esp\u00edrito\n            Santo and improved cross-sectoral integration. They evolved\n            as a result of the State's implementation experience\n            through the long-term partnership established with the Bank\n            since 1994, and the willingness of the government to\n            experiment with this new approach at the time the 1994\n            project was restructured. These arrangements, as well as\n            continued commitment and support to the project, facilitated\n            overcoming obstacles encountered during project\n            implementation and catalyzed the development of new\n            strategies to move forward. The integrated arrangements\n            mentioned above also mainstreamed social and environmental\n            sustainability amongst representatives of both the State\n            Government and project executing agencies. Sustainability\n            was also emphasized in the design and use of a comprehensive\n            project approach which included water supply, sewerage\n            collection and treatment as well as water resources\n            management. It is to be noted that the success of using a\n            turnkey contract model is greatly attributable to the\n            technical capacity of the executing agency. In this case the\n            UGP (Project Management Unit - Unidade de Gestao do Projeto)\n            hired a qualified project management/ engineering firm in\n            order to ensure adequate technical expertise was timely\n            available. This firm had well established terms of reference\n            and contract arrangements were well defined. Aside from\n            assisting with overall project management, the firm was\n            responsible for reviewing the project detailed engineering\n            designs and supervising the works. Sub contracting under\n            turnkey contracts should only be considered for expansion or\n            rehabilitation of sewage collection or water distribution\n            networks. Elements of a higher technical level such as\n            pumping stations and water or wastewater treatment plants\n            should not be allowed to be sub-contracted under turnkey contracts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Esprito Santo Water and Coastal\n            Pollution Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Esprito Santo Water and\n

objectives of the Additional\n            Financing for the Espirito Santo Water and Coastal Pollution\n            Management Project for Brazil is: (a) to improve the\n            efficiency of the water supply and sewerage systems of State\n            Water Company of Espirito Santo (CESAN) by supporting its\n            efforts to operate on a commercial basis with financial\n            self-sufficiency; and (b) to increase the coverage level of\n            CESAN water supply and basic sanitation services in the\n            urban areas of the municipalities of the metropolitan region\n            of Grande Vitoria. The additional costs of building the\n            water and sewerage works have resulted from design changes\n            brought about by updated and more detailed engineering\n            analyses, particularly: (a) the adoption of higher technical\n            standards to better satisfy environmental concerns\n            (including more rigorous implementation arrangements in\n            densely urbanized areas with intense traffic and the\n            building of sludge treatment units); (b) the introduction of\n            technology improvements; (c) a larger than estimated\n            population size in the cities targeted by the project; and\n            (d) bringing forward the third phase of the Mulemba sewage\n            treatment plant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
