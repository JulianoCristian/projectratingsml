The\n            Liepaja environmental project pursued the aim of restoring\n            water quality. Wastewater from which phosphorus and nitrogen\n            were not removed deprived the seawaters of oxygen.\n            Wastewater was discharged completely untreated into the\n            Liepaja Lake and the city canal. This project offered an\n            advantage over other regions, namely how to attract and use\n            financing. The project enabled to excel among other Baltic\n            states, admits Gunars Ansins, Director of the Liepaja city\n            council's development department. Two facilities for\n            removing iron from the drinking water have been built under\n            the project. The outcomes of the World Bank environmental\n            project in Liepaja are impressive, indeed: picturesque lake\n            of Pape in Rucava was tidied up, beach was accommodated, and\n            opportunities for tourism developed at the seashore village\n            of Jurkalne."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Inhabitants of Liepaja do not pollute the sea"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Inhabitants of Liepaja do not\n            pollute the sea"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2004/04/23978699/inhabitants-liepaja-not-pollute-sea","count":"Latvia","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"drinking water, household appliances, iron,\n            iron removal, nitrogen, North Sea, oxygen, pipes, pollution,\n            project management, sand, Sea, sediments, sewage, sewage\n            system, sludge, Solid Waste, Solid Waste Management,\n            washing, washing machines, Waste Management, wastewater,\n            wastewater treatment, wastewater treatment systems, water\n            body, water quality, water system, waters, wells"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Urban development","topic":"Water Treatment m1326992 2008,Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water, Sanitation and Hygiene m1326125 1462,Water Pollution m1327598 1798,Water Quality Monitoring m1326523 2009","projn":"LV-Liepaja Environment -- P008533","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Conservation,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150210124749"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sewerage,Other industry","theme":"Water resource management,Pollution management and environmental health,Other urban development,Environmental policies and institutions,Biodiversity","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Water Treatment m1326992 2008,Water Resources Management m1326089 141,Water, Sanitation and Hygiene m1326125 1462,Water Pollution m1327598 1798,Water Quality Monitoring m1326523 2009","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF023410-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF024256-BALTIC-RIGA REGIONAL MISSION,TF024257-SECONDMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST,TF031575-GLOBAL - MARINE ENVIRONMENTS,TF032284-REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA -\n            SIAULIAI ENVIRONMENT PROJECT,TF032499-ESTONIA - HAAPSALU AND MATSALU\n            BAY ENVIRONMENT PROJECT,TF032899-EASTERN EUROPE - ENVIRONMENTAL\n            PROJECTS IN THE BALTIC SEA AREA,TF033037-EASTERN EUROPE\n            (ESTONIA,LATVIA,LITHUANIA) - ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS,TF033491-ECA REGION (ESTONIA,\n            LATVIA,LITHUANIA) ENV.
