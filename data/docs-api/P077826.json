Some lessons learned included: this operation\n            highlights that in a highly changing institutional\n            environment, such as Nicaragua, it takes time and patience\n            to make an impact. It is important to ensure that Bank\n            project teams and their country counterparts understand well\n            project implications in terms of expected output and\n            outcomes. In addition, Bank teams should timely restructure\n            monitoring indicators to reflect the evolving realities on\n            the ground. Project monitoring should be an integral\n            component of supervision and Implementation Status and\n            Results, or ISRs, with key performance indicators helping\n            guide execution and decisions. Strong ownership of this\n            Technical Assistance Lending, or TAL helped to make sizable\n            progress following decisive policy actions by the Government\n            and the National Assembly or when Micro-finance institution\n            or MFIs saw clear advantages in their modernization and\n            transformation. Commitment on the part of Superintendence of\n            Banks and Other Financial Institutions, or SIBOIF is also\n            worth noting, in contrast with the deficiencies at the\n            Borrower's second-tier investment financial company, or\n            FNI. The fact that Bank projects in Nicaragua, as those of\n            other international organizations, need to be cleared at the\n            National Assembly implies that there has to be a broad\n            political consensus that includes also the implementation\n            details of any initiative."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Broad Based Access to Finance

The closing date for the project will be\n            extended from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2012, to\n            enable the project to assist the government to develop a\n            legal and regulatory framework for microfinance, strengthen\n            the capacity of Superintendence of Bank and Other Financial\n            Institutions (SIBOIF), and support the transformation of\n            microfinance institutions into regulated financial\n            institutions. The extension is necessary to provide\n            additional time and support to project implementing agencies\n            and the private sector partners to secure the gains in\n            access to finance. The Borrower has in place an action plan\n            to complete the project and disburse the remaining US$3.4\n            million in project funds within the two-year period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Broad Based Access to\n            Financial Services Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/09/14288031/nicaragua-broad-based-access-financial-services-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"NI-Broad-Based Access To Financial Services\n            -- P077826","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Microfinance,E-Business,Emerging Markets,Debt Markets,Non Bank Financial Institutions","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development","count":"Nicaragua","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20110603001035"},"subsc":"General finance sector,Micro- and SME finance","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, Agency risk, Bank supervision,\n            Borrower, businesses, Cooperatives, equipment, Financial\n            Institution, Financial Institutions, FINANCIAL SERVICES,\n            government organization, implementing agencies, implementing\n            agency, income, international consultant, Microfinance,\n            microfinance clients, microfinance institutions, Operating\n            environment, private credit, private sector, registry,\n            regulatory framework, regulatory system, Risk Mitigation,\n            state bank, supervision, Targets, technical assistance"}},"owner":"Finance & Private Sector (LCSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF051145-PHRD-NICARAGUA: RURAL\n            MICROFINANCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF057844-PHRD: BROAD BASED ACCESS TO\n            FINANCIAL SERVICES PROJECT","repnb":"55570"},"facets":{}}}
