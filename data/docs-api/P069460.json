Some lessons learned included:\n            involvement of the community is essential to ensure that\n            ownership and commitment to development efforts is\n            maintained and that biodiversity management plans respond to\n            real needs. The inclusion is necessary to focus efforts more\n            on people who need to benefit most, and to strengthen the\n            quality of outcomes. Interaction and linkages among planners\n            and stakeholders are also important in fostering\n            camaraderie, which in turn fosters better stakeholder\n            collaboration. A complex and rigid implementing arrangement\n            does not provide the flexibility critical for testing of new\n            models, quick results and maintaining political and\n            operational independence for piloting innovative approaches.\n            More efficient procurement organization and procedures may\n            avoid some serious delays in project implementation.\n            Frequent training in the Bank\u0092s procurement procedures\n            during implementation is necessary to avoid delays in\n            procurement aspects. Adequate project staff, with\n            appropriate experience should have adequate knowledge of all\n            the elements of the grant agreement and Project Appraisal\n            Document (PAD), as well as of Bank procedures baseline data\n            should be collected prior to the startup of the activities.\n            For effective project implementation, it is critical to have\n            continuity in leadership in order to sustain the pace of\n            implementation overtime as well as provide continuous\n            direction and encouragement to staff to work toward\n            achieving project outcomes. An effective steering committee\n            can greatly facilitate key decisions and positively impact\n            on project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Gulf of Gabes Marine and
