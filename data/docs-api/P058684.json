Nonetheless, performances are rated\n            satisfactory by the Bank, and highly satisfactory by the\n            Borrower. Lessons address the following: a) flexibility in\n            design: interventions designed in a\n            post-conflict/in-conflict area should have flexibility so as\n            to absorb shocks, and still be relevant in meeting the\n            projects development objective. Furthermore, the ability to\n            respond to rapid changes on the ground - such as removing\n            the requirement for community cash contributions when the\n            poverty rates had risen - ensured that the poorest, who the\n            project was designed to serve, were not the ones left out\n            due to stringent requirements; 2) development objective: the\n            importance of having a clearly focused development objective\n            allowed addressing monitoring and measurement of\n            achievements, which would have been difficult if both\n            short-term emergency priorities, and long-term development\n            activities been encompassed; 3)targeting strategy: the\n            development and use of the poverty map for identifying\n            project areas, assisted the implementing agencies (IAs) to\n            target the resources for maximum impact. Moreover, the\n            poverty map and targeting strategy provided the IAs with a\n            clear, and transparent project rationale.

The components of the project include:\n            1) Local government units will identify and implement\n            infrastructure micro-projects. Mostly local contractors,\n            suppliers and laborers will perform work improvements in\n            infrastructure. 2) Technical assistance will be provided to\n            local governments to ensure high quality and responsiveness\n            in micro-project implementation. Technical assistance will\n            also be provided for project management, and to local\n            contractors. 3) Supplemental operating costs will be\n            provided for project execution and management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Second Community\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - Second\n            Community Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/03/439541/west-bank-gaza-second-community-development-project","projn":"GZ-Community Dev.
