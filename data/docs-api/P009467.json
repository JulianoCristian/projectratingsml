The key lessons learned include the\n            following: Adequate resources should be made available for\n            supervision. Institutional strengthening should receive more\n            and explicit attention; this project is a prime example of\n            how institutional weaknesses can seriously damage the\n            quality of relatively simple physical works. The major\n            problem facing the project was the government's\n            inability to implement the agreed resettlement plan. More\n            attention should be given to the institutional capacity of\n            the local agency responsible for resettlement, and the plan\n            should be formulated based on full participation of all the\n            project affected people. In a country like Bangladesh which\n            is prone to frequent natural disasters, there should be\n            projects flexible enough to reallocate project funds for\n            emergency assistance without having to go through\n            time-consuming paper work. All the data needed for ex-post\n            economic analysis should be part of the project's\n            performance indicators. It is very important to help build\n            institutional capacities of implementing agencies for\n            effective monitoring and evaluation. Beneficiary\n            participation is needed at every stage of development\n            projects; government officials should be trained to improve\n            their skills in community participation. Project size and\n            complexity should be reduced, focusing on specific\n            sub-sectors and numbering a few components that can be\n            implemented by one or a few agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Urban Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/05/728339/bangladesh-urban-development-project","projn":"BD-Urban Dev.
