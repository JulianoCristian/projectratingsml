The project consists of\n            constructing 20 silos with an average capacity of 100,000 m\n            tons, each equipped with drying, cleaning and fumigating\n            facilities; minor improvements of rail reception facilities\n            at major ports; and modification of 2,000 box cars for\n            effective grain transport. Through technical assistance, the\n            project will improve the Grain Board's computerized\n            inventory control system and its capabilities for inspection\n            and supervision of primary silos. Also included are a\n            program for training Grain Board staff to operate project\n            silos and pilot dredging for the Port of Bahia Blanca to\n            determine the feasibility of deepening the port access\n            channel. There are no special risks, although inefficient\n            silo management and lower grain production levels than\n            forecast could cause lower volumes of grain to pass through\n            the silos and consequently result in smaller than projected benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Grain Storage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - Grain Storage

conditioning facilities and by\n            improving transport facilities. The project consists of\n            constructing 20 silos with an average capacity of 100,000 m\n            tons, each equipped with drying, cleaning and fumigating\n            facilities; minor improvements of rail reception facilities\n            at major ports; and modification of 2,000 box cars for\n            effective grain transport. Through technical assistance, the\n            project will improve the Grain Board's computerized\n            inventory control system and its capabilities for inspection\n            and supervision of primary silos. Also included are a\n            program for training Grain Board staff to operate project\n            silos and pilot dredging for the Port of Bahia Blanca to\n            determine the feasibility of deepening the port access\n            channel. There are no special risks, although inefficient\n            silo management and lower grain production levels than\n            forecast could cause lower volumes of grain to pass through\n            the silos and consequently result in smaller than projected benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
