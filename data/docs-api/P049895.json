The lessons learned included: 1) The project\n            yields a significant number of lessons learned for future\n            higher education projects involving student loans. The high\n            number of lessons learned is not a result of unsatisfactory\n            design or implementation, but rather a result of two\n            factors: (i) the project design was innovative and\n            experimental; and (ii) implementation has been dynamic and\n            guided by substantial monitoring and evaluation efforts; 2)\n            Overall, this experience confirms the technical and\n            political difficulties of setting up a successful student\n            loan system; 3) Design of responsibilities and incentives\n            are crucial for student loans given its long-term nature; 4)\n            Risk and cost sharing with universities is crucial; 5)\n            Continued public investment in student loans is required; 6)\n            A public-private partnership in student loans is desirable\n            but difficult when financial risks are uncertain; 7)\n            Although student loan is a higher education policy\n            instrument, it is also a financial instrument, and\n            experience from the commercial banking sector is necessary;\n            8) Long term sustainability of the interest rate is\n            important; 9) Long-term financing of student loans is\n            required; 10) Attention to collection cannot be\n            overestimated. Student loan systems in developing countries\n            often fail to grow because of a large implicit subsidy,\n            which in many cases is exaggerated and untargeted due to\n            high defaults; 11) Fear of borrowing is a problem; and 12)\n            Ensure the financial conditions of the assets and\n            liabilities match."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Higher Education Financing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Higher Education\n            Financing Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/8004619/mexico-higher-education-financing-project","projn":"MX-Higher Ed.

The\n            project has two components. The first component develops a\n            private sector student loan program to improve access to\n            private education for students who are academically\n            qualified but financially needy. It designs selection\n            criteria, decides the terms and conditions of student loans,\n            and determines the legal and institutional arrangements for\n            program administration. A second sub-component supports the\n            start-up costs of the student loan program--costs related to\n            establishing the central and satellite offices, setting up a\n            coherent management information system, developing a\n            marketing and promotion strategy, and financing equipment\n            and technical assistance. The second component strengthens\n            the Sonora (the Institute of Educational Credit of the State\n            of Sonora) Student Loan Program by revising its evaluation\n            and selections instruments to better reflect targeting\n            goals; carries out a yearly survey of the socioeconomic\n            background of its beneficiaries; changes the terms and\n            conditions of its loans; and makes legal and institutional\n            arrangements for program administration. This component also\n            provides technical assistance to help the Institute design\n            and implement a long-term institutional development plan as\n            well as equipment (computer) and training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Higher Education Financing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Higher Education\n            Financing Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/06/442136/mexico-higher-education-financing-project","projn":"MX-Higher Ed.
