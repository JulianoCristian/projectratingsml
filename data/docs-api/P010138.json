(c) assistance to the domestic\n            construction industry. The benefits will accrue mostly in\n            savings on vehicle operating costs and will be widely\n            distributed. The project involves no special risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Third Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Third Highway
