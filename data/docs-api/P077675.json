Some lessons\n            learned includes: the need for speed in project preparation\n            and a project's quality at entry must be balanced. This\n            is a project that was prepared, from identification to Board\n            presentation, in about 11 months. The project was prepared\n            for a country that was just exiting a tumultuous period in\n            its history, and was identified when the Minister for Health\n            (MOH) had no MOH and approved about a month after the\n            assassination of the Serbian Prime Minister. The Bank needs\n            to increase its knowledge on matters around licensing of\n            Information Technology software and licenses in the health\n            sector. This project lost about 7 months of implementation\n            of Disease Related Group (DRG) activities while issues\n            surrounding the licensing of DRG classification system were\n            being resolved. An improperly designed Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) can raise serious questions about\n            overall quality of project identification and of project\n            design. This is in addition to making project monitoring a\n            real challenge and making it difficult to demonstrate the\n            achievements/ failure of a project. The next Bank supported\n            operation must seriously explore an implementation\n            arrangement that integrates the functions of a Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU) within the MOH. The establishment of\n            a PCU outside the MOH was probably an appropriate decision\n            for the project at the time when capacity within the MOH was\n            still in development. However, it is clear that with the\n            increased capacity of the MOH, the Bank and the borrower\n            must consider having implementation arrangements that\n            fosters closer collaboration, ensure an environment\n            conducive to mutual learning and exchange of knowledge, and\n            implementation experiences between the project coordination\n            team and the MOH. Long-term engagement of the Bank in Serbia\n            must recognize that health sector reforms are complex and\n            often take a number of years. This is particularly the case\n            when they are comprehensive as it is the case in Serbia,\n            where they were addressing financing reforms at all levels\n            of health care, efficiency, quality and resulting in number\n            of positive outcomes. However, in order to keep the momentum\n            and provide enabling environment to successful completion of\n            the reforms, the Bank should consider a longer term approach\n            in its support through a follow up project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia - Additional Financing for the Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia - Additional Financing for\n
