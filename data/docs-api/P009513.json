ISAC-II supported a wide\n            range of reforms in three areas: (1) Import liberalization\n            to reduce and rationalize effective protection and also to\n            streamline import procedures; (2) Export Promotion through:\n            (i) improved coverage and operation of the duty drawback and\n            bonding programs to provide direct and indirect exporters\n            with world priced inputs; and (ii) a more strategic approach\n            to other aspects of export promotion utilizing a\n            strengthened Export Promotion Bureau, matching grants, and\n            deregulation. Three main lessons were learned to reduce the\n            risk of partial failure in support for complex reform\n            programs :( 1) Adequate allowance should be made for the\n            ability of an unconvinced and/or technically weak\n            bureaucracy to thwart essential institutional aspects of\n            policy reform; ( 2) Projects which involve reform in several\n            areas at once need commitment from all concerned Ministers,\n            with collective responsibility and/or strong leadership.( 3)\n            A Comprehensive reform agenda should be supported by several\n            operations and non-lending instruments, either in series or parallel."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Industrial Sector\n            Adjustment Credit

They\n            include import liberalization, strengthening of institutions\n            involved with export promotion and reforms aimed at\n            transforming the regulatory stance of the Government towards\n            private sector development to a promotional one. The reform\n            program will: (1) increase Bangladesh's competitiveness\n            and potential for labor-intensive growth; (2) increase\n            producers' ability to respond quickly to changing\n            market conditions while reducing opportunities for\n            unproductive rent seeking; and (3) enhance the\n            Government's capacity for efficient performance in\n            policy making and delivering services to export and other\n            private producers.
