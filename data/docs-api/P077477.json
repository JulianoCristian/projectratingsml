Lessons learned included:\n            policy reversals can cause serious damage to otherwise\n            significant project outcomes, and are difficult to counter.\n            District proliferation or reduction in un-earmarked funding\n            or local governments' rights to raise revenues need to\n            be monitored closely as they could be an early signal of\n            policy reversal. Monitoring should be focused on outcome in\n            addition to process indicators and unified across sectors.\n            Decentralization is not a sector, while it was treated as\n            such in Uganda with a sector working group, a sector\n            investment plan and specific donor support. Decentralization\n            of service delivery affects all sectors of the economy and\n            should be supported in a harmonized way across sectors and\n            donor programs. Many conditional grants to Local Governments\n            are funded through donor programs. A fully decentralized\n            sector allocation, supported through government budgets,\n            requires a change in the way donors allocate funds across\n            sectors within a given country as such allocations cannot be\n            determined a priori any more if the choice of sectors is\n            truly delegated to Local Governments and communities. This\n            is often incompatible with the development cooperation\n            frameworks of bilateral donors, or the sector-specific teams\n            and earmarked funds of multilaterals, that work in tandem\n            with line ministries in developing countries like Uganda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Second Local Government Development\n            Project (LGDP

- Second Local Government\n            Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Second Local Government\n            Development Project (LGDP II) in Uganda were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included:  a core of LGDP II focus was on the transfer,\n            monitoring and accounting for regular Local Development\n            Grants (LDG) and Capacity Building Grants (CBG) to local\n            governments. The grants were contingent on the local\n            governments passing an annual performance assessment. LGDP\n            II was designed to fund the two grants and annual\n            assessments for the first three years of the four year\n            project period. It was believed that if the two grants and\n            local government performance were indeed critical,\n            Government of Uganda (GoU) will begin funding and managing\n            them from its own resources. This materialized in the third\n            year of the project when GoU began funding both grants from\n            its own budget, included them in the Medium Term Expenditure\n            Framework (MTEF) and mainstreamed the annual assessment of\n            local governments through its own Inspectorate Department.\n            Building capacity requires much more than providing training\n            and conducting workshops: getting fiscal transfers right is\n            just one part of ensuring effective decentralization.\n            Building institutional and human capacity within central as\n            well as local governments is equally important and which\n            cannot be achieved by depending on training events and\n            workshops alone. LGDP II used multiple approaches including\n            active mentoring of local government staff by senior and\n            more experienced government personnel who provided hands on\n            support to their colleagues, ensuring standardization of\n            information flows through the preparation of handbooks and\n            guidelines with clear instructions on how to implement new\n            procedures, conducting regular assessments to provide follow\n            up guidance and feedback. Of course, training was required,\n            but instead of contracting out training, LGDP II was\n            instrumental in creating a national market for training\n            where the local governments procured training from a list of\n            accredited private and public training providers who had to\n            compete for it. As an unintended consequence, the\n            competitive training providers market has also led to the\n            creation of a growing local pool of consultants who now\n            understand and can respond to the needs of local governments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

assessment for\n            Uganda's Second Local Government Development Program\n            Project provides a framework to establish the screening\n            process mechanism that identifies potential environmental\n            and social impacts of sub-projects and to address them by\n            incorporating the relevant mitigation measures into\n            sub-project design. The main feature of this mechanism\n            requires the sub-project implementers to screen their\n            sub-projects at the preparation stage using the screening\n            form in Annex 1 of this report and the revised environmental\n            and social checklist to identify potential adverse\n            effects/impacts. Sub-projects requiring individual\n            environmental and social impact assessments (ESIAs) are\n            those costing US$100,000 and/or sub-projects involving new\n            roads, incorporating use of hazardous chemicals and managing\n            solid, liquid, or medical wastes. The use of the results of\n            the ESIA would be how these sub-projects identify their\n            adverse effects which would then be adequately mitigated in\n            the sub-project designs before submission for review and\n            approval. This Environmental and Social Management Framework\n            (ESMF) report assesses the capacity at the District and\n            Lower Local Governments to implement the proposed screening\n            process and mitigation measures, including the provision of\n            support to communities in cases of community-managed\n            sub-projects, and makes recommendations, including training\n            needs and cost. The ESMF assessed the content, use, and\n            effectiveness of the existing Environment and Social\n            Checklist prepared under the project; and recommended a\n            significant overhaul to make it simpler and easier to use at\n            all levels of the local government system, but especially at\n            the level of the Technical Planning Committee (TPC) and the\n            Project Management Committee (PMC) levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Second Local Government Development\n            Program (LGDP) Project : environmental and social management\n            framework (ESMF) report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Second Local Government\n            Development Program (LGDP) Project : environmental and\n            social management framework (ESMF) report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/01/2230527/uganda-second-local-government-development-program-lgdp-project-environmental-social-management-framework-esmf-report","projn":"UG-Second Local Government Development\n            Project -- P077477","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Knowledge Economy,Municipal Financial Management,Education for the Knowledge Economy,National Governance","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Education","count":"Uganda","authors":{"authr":"Monday, James Orehmie"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03041804131669"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Primary education,Health,Roads and highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability,administrative\n            offices,Authority,Banks,Central\n            Government,Constitution,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,deposits,disclosure,Districts,employment,environmental\n            policies,execution,executive\n            committees,expenditure,Government Level,government\n            policy,Government Revenue,government revenues,government\n            structures,Human Resource,Human Resource\n            Development,information systems,institutional\n            arrangements,institutional framework,knowledge\n            transfer,Laws,legislative proposals,local authorities,Local\n            Councils,Local Government,Local Government Revenue,local\n            government structures,Local Governments,local\n            laws,mandates,MIS,national level,national planning,natural\n            resources,networks,public services,regulatory\n            framework,regulatory requirements,representatives,service\n            delivery,Social Assessment,technical assistance,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accountability,administrative\n            offices,Authority,Banks,Central\n            Government,Constitution,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,deposits,disclosure,Districts,employment,environmental\n            policies,execution,executive\n            committees,expenditure,Government Level,government\n            policy,Government Revenue,government revenues,government\n            structures,Human Resource,Human Resource\n            Development,information systems,institutional\n            arrangements,institutional framework,knowledge\n            transfer,Laws,legislative proposals,local authorities,Local\n            Councils,Local Government,Local Government Revenue,local\n            government structures,Local Governments,local\n            laws,mandates,MIS,national level,national planning,natural\n            resources,networks,public services,regulatory\n            framework,regulatory requirements,representatives,service\n            delivery,Social Assessment,technical assistance,water supply"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Anglophone (AFTU1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF051963-PRSP-UGANDA CAPACITY BUILDING\n            FOR DECENTRALIZED COMMUNITY BASED PARTICI,TF038698-UGANDA:  LOCAL GOVERNMENT II","repnb":"E722"},"facets":{}}}
