With regard\n            to the Second Rehabilitation Loan Project, while all the\n            required policy reforms were completed prior to Board\n            presentation, these reforms were insufficient to forestall\n            further declines in output. Furthermore, the monetary\n            stabilization program was never underpinned by adequate\n            fiscal discipline. Therefore, OED rates the project outcome\n            as moderately unsatisfactory and the ID impact as\n            negligible. For both rehabilitation loans, sustainability is\n            rated as likely, and Bank performances are rated as\n            satisfactory. Borrower performance for the First\n            Rehabilitation Loan was satisfactory, and unsatisfactory for\n            the Second Rehabilitation loan. For both Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Projects, OED rates the outcome as\n            unsatisfactory and ID impact as modest, but sustainability\n            of the limited achievements are considered as likely. Both\n            Bank and Borrower performances are evaluated as\n            unsatisfactory for both SALs. Several important lessons may\n            be drawn from these projects. First, sound macroeconomic\n            management is a pre-requisite for the positive responses\n            expected to flow from structural reform, under all\n            policy-based types of lending. Second, country ownership is\n            crucial to the success of assistance. Third, in the face of\n            a poor track record and narrow country ownership of reform,\n            a large adjustment lending program (especially one with\n            front-loaded disbursements) risk delaying rather than\n            accelerating reform. Fourth, in the face of a poor track\n            record and new consensus on a reform program, adjustment\n            lending should be offered after the government has publicly\n            adopted the necessary reforms or has begun implementing\n            them. Disbursements should be backloaded and carefully\n            modulated on the basis of solid progress in implementation,\n            including enforcement of laws and regulations. Fifth, there\n            needs to be strong strategic coordination and integration of\n            actors, instruments, and interventions supporting common\n            objectives both within the country and the Bank and among\n            external development partners. Sixth, the Bank should not\n            ignore in its adjustment lending the quality of public\n            institutions and governance. Finally, the Bank should keep\n            \"windows of opportunity\" in perspective, as\n            transition and development take time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - The First and

         lay the foundation for renewed economic growth, maintain\n            macroeconomic stabilization over the medium-term, and\n            provide an adequate level of public services during the\n            fiscal transition. The project consists of five components.\n            First, the \"natural\" monopolies reform component\n            will focus on improving pricing; reducing arrears and\n            strengthening payment discipline; strengthening regulation;\n            and demonopolizing sectors. Second, the private sector\n            development component will revitalize the enterprise\n            privatization program; establish institutions and policies\n            that promote competition; create functioning markets for\n            urban land and real estate; and further develop capital\n            markets. Third, the fiscal management component will improve\n            the tax structure and tax administration; strengthen budget\n            management; rationalize government spending; and restructure\n            intergovernmental fiscal relations. Fourth, the banking\n            reform component will focus on problem banks and deposit\n            protection; strengthen prudential regulations and\n            supervision; and improve the money markets and payment\n            systems. Fifth, the trade policy reform component will\n            maintain a liberalized trade regime; harmonize standards\n            with international practice; expand production sharing\n            agreements; implement a market-based system for oil\n            transport; and phase out the oil export of state need program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Second Structural\n
