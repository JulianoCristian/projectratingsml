Bank performance was satisfactory.  Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was satisfactory. There were a few lessons to be\n            learnt from this project's experience : (a) dealing\n            with long-term  objectives, a new Policy Statement need not\n            be designed for every sector project, but each such project\n            should have a modular action plan; (b) rationalization of\n            the institutional development and corresponding changes in\n            the legal framework, should be viewed as a dynamic\n            interactive process; and (c) investing in Technical\n            Assistance (TA) and training for institutional capacity\n            building purposes can yield high returns in terms of\n            development effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Highway Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -
