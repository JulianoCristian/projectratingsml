Some lessons learned included:\n            the reforms and institution building envisaged under\n            LOGOFIND required time and sustained dialogue within\n            government. Government of the Philippines (GOP) and the Bank\n            will have benefited from phased program, with a series of\n            loans funding activities but approved sequentially as\n            progress of implementation of reforms are made. Through\n            Adaptable Program Loan (APL), adjustments can be made as the\n            reforms are carried out, unlike with the regular investment\n            lending. In the case of LOGOFIND, the attempt was to\n            complete a rather package of reforms that proved to be\n            unrealistic given the institutional, economic, and political\n            circumstance and the short timeframe for implementation. If\n            it were pursued through an APL, the first phase could have\n            addressed the institutional and capacity requirements of the\n            Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) as the implementing\n            agency. The succeeding loans could have then covered the\n            next phases of MDFO reorganization and transformation into a\n            separate entity. In this way, the institutions and agencies\n            that are assigned the responsibility for overseeing the\n            reform process could also be assisted and strengthened while\n            allowing them to implement the reform agenda and they will\n            be more prepared to deal with more complex institutional\n            reforms requiring actions like creation of municipal\n            financial entities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Local Government Finance and\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Philippines - Local Government\n

This report\n            anticipates likely negative environmental impacts connected\n            to the development of integrated waste management\n            facilities, and proposes measures to mitigate them. They\n            include the following: To offset negative visual effects\n            from the change in landscape character, provide vegetative\n            cover on closed portions of the landfill and convert land to\n            area to be used for recreation or low intensity agriculture,\n            service roads, ditches, ponds, and wetland areas. Use solid\n            perimeter fencing around the construction site, storm water\n            management, including surface water drainage control and\n            treatment system to reduce leachate generation and flooding,\n            and cover slopes with vegetation. To manage impacts\n            affecting air quality including odor control, provide daily\n            cover, minimize presence of exposed waste material, provide\n            fencing, and keep excavated areas wet. Install noise fencing\n            at sensitive sites, use machinery that suppresses noise,\n            avoid nighttime work, and use mobile noise barriers. To\n            relieve traffic congestion, direct traffic during heavy\n            periods.
