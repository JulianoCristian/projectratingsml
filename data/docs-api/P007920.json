The main lessons learned from the\n            project include: 1) Tariffs need to be set at sustainable\n            levels. 2) Community participation in the various phases of\n            the project is essential for the success and long-term\n            sustainability of the project. 3) National Environmental\n            Sanitation Services (SENASA) should make a sustained effort\n            to collect the payments on the loans to the Juntas (a\n            community organization). 4) SENASA should make increased use\n            of alternative technologies and apply lower cost and\n            appropriate solutions. 5) SENASA should strengthen its\n            hygiene education activities to ensure that sanitation needs\n            are adequately addressed. 6) SENASA should transform itself\n            from an agency doing the works to one that facilitates the\n            construction of systems. 7) SENASA should modernize its\n            internal information systems. 8) Financing of water meters\n            should be offered in the loans for Juntas (a community\n            organization). 9) The provision of water and sanitation to\n            the rural areas lends itself to the use of the Bank's\n            \"Adaptable Program Lending\" instrument."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Third Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation
