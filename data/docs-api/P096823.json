Some lessons learned included:\n            a well formulated Results Framework, with outputs leading to\n            intermediate outcomes, leading to outcomes, with baseline\n            data and targets upon completion can facilitate project\n            management and oversight. Disbursement schedules need to\n            take into account the nature of the activities being\n            financed, and the estimated time needed to and cost of\n            implementing each of the activities. The project devoted\n            about one third of its funding to supervision intensive and\n            slow disbursing technical assistance that was required\n            up-front to help define both the policy actions, and more\n            importantly, the grant programs and information systems that\n            were to be financed later. Implementation support identified\n            that these issues with design were impacting the pace of\n            disbursements, but spent an inordinate effort in\n            accelerating disbursements when the issue was structural.\n            Placing a fiduciary coordinating unit in one of the\n            implementing agencies helps to provide some coordination of\n            at least procedural requirements, but can create some\n            tensions among implementing agencies. The financial services\n            unit was housed in the Ministry of Health and the other\n            implementing agencies could voice concern about lack of\n            attention or support to their needs. It would have been\n            preferable to have the coordinating unit in this case housed\n            in a central ministry that was not directly an implementing agency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia - Delivery of Improved Local Services\n            (DILS) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia - Delivery of Improved\n            Local Services

The closing date for the project\n            will be extended by 12 months from December 31, 2012 until\n            December 31, 2013. The project implementation significantly\n            improved over time and benefited from a level two\n            restructuring approved on June 26, 2012. At the time of the\n            loan closing, the majority but not all of the project\n            outputs will have been achieved. There are no outstanding\n            audits and auditors have issued unqualified opinions\n            throughout.

In a letter dated November 21, 2012,\n            the Minister of Finance and Economy requested an extension\n            of the loan closing date by 12 months to achieve all of the\n            project objectives in a fully satisfactory manner. The\n            government also submitted and the Bank reviewed and found\n            acceptable an action plan that specifies all activities for\n            the extension period.
