The project's implementation strategies were\n            not adequate for La Paz and required change from the very\n            beginning. The design will have benefited from the views and\n            knowledge of local counterparts and staff in Bolivia to\n            better identify the most appropriate strategies to the\n            country's context. Project restructuring is an\n            opportunity to address shortcomings in design. Building\n            strategic alliances with key actors is essential to a\n            program's success. Upgrades in school infrastructure\n            can improve neighborhood quality of life. Phased\n            construction enables the improvement of techniques.

The changes and\n            rationale are as follows: 1) a revision of the scope and\n            description of some project sub-components to respond to\n            project, municipal and country realities, including the new\n            education law, Avelino Sinani - Elizardo Perez , which was\n            passed in December 2010; 2) a reallocation of funds among\n            categories consistent with the increase in cost of\n            construction, furniture and equipment and a consequent\n            reduction in the cost and scope of project activities\n            relating to the quality of education and institutional\n            strengthening; 3) a revision of the results matrix to\n            reflect the adjustments in project activities. New\n            indicators have been introduced to monitor the number of\n            direct project beneficiaries; and 4) a six-month extension\n            of the closing date so that the remaining planned classrooms\n            can be completed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia -

This\n            component supports the efforts of the OMDH to promote\n            expanded coverage in secondary education (grades 9 through\n            12) and completion in the upper primary (grades 7 and 8) and\n            early secondary grades by: (i) increasing the number of\n            available secondary schooling places by 19,600, representing\n            41 percent of current enrollment; and (ii) increasing\n            secondary completion rates of approximately 5,130 students\n            at risk of educational failure, defined as having two or\n            more years of age/grade distortion.

This\n            component also establishes partnerships to create pedagogic\n            resource platforms. Component three: education management\n            and institutional strengthening.
