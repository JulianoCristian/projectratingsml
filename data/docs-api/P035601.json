The second project, building on\n            the results of the first, is currently carrying out\n            population control and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or\n            AIDS prevention initiatives at the community level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Fighting HIV or AIDS in Chad"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Fighting HIV or AIDS in Chad"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23809569/fighting-hiv-or-aids-chad","count":"Chad","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to education, aged, AIDS control\n            project, AIDS epidemic, AIDS prevention, AIDS prevention\n            plan, AIDS project, condoms, contraception methods, first\n            child, health care, Health Sector, HIV, HIV/AIDS, live\n            births, maternal mortality, modern contraception, National\n            AIDS, National AIDS Control, national health, population\n            control, teens, virus"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Human development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"La lutte contre le VIH/SIDA au Tchad"}},"topic":"Health Education m1327026 1463,HIV and AIDS m1327522 1416,Health Emergencies m1326557 2165,HIV/AIDS and Education m1326805 1542,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397","projn":"TD-Population & Aids Control -- P035601","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"HIV AIDS,Adolescent Health,Gender and Health,Disease Control & Prevention,Population Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150116153813"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Africa!$!80454"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Africa!$!80454"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Africa!$!80454"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Africa!$!80454"}},"admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Other social services,Health,Central government administration","theme":"Population and reproductive health,Participation and civic engagement,HIV/AIDS","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Education m1327026 1463,HIV and AIDS m1327522 1416,Health Emergencies m1326557 2165,HIV/AIDS and Education m1326805 1542,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C"],"trustfund":"TF024991-FRENCH CTF (FY97 ALLOCATIONS)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"Central Africa"}},"repnb":"91743"},"1940620":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/06/1940620/chad-population-aids-control-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/06/1940620/chad-population-aids-control-project","new_url":"2002/06/1940620/chad-population-aids-control-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/08/16/000094946_02071004024262/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/08/16/000094946_02071004024262/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"2692;P859","docdt":"2002-06-12T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2002-08-16T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Chad - Population and AIDS Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The outcome of the Population & AIDS\n            Control Project is rated as satisfactory, sustainability as\n            likely, institutional development impact as modest, Bank\n            performance as satisfactory, and borrower performance as\n            satisfactory. Several of the lessons learned from this\n            project concern the lack of leadership commitment towards\n            key basic objectives of the project, the need to clarify\n            institutional arrangements during project design, and the\n            importance of baseline data for proper project design and\n            monitoring. There is a great need in Francophone sub-Saharan\n            Africa for enhanced policy dialogue in population and\n            reproductive health. And the policy dialogue needs to be\n            focused. Task teams need to better recognize that results in\n            the area of population, reproductive health, and\n            HIV/AIDS/STDs take time to materialize in the SSA context\n            because they involve tackling sensitive issues in\n            traditional cultures. Monitoring and evaluation systems and\n            baseline data are a priority, particularly in population and\n            HIV/AIDS/STDs projects. The project demonstrated that even\n            in highly traditional and religious cultures, it is possible\n            to bring about social change through the use of good\n            information, education, and communication messages and\n            social marketing techniques, and to get the population to\n            learn fairly rapidly about HIV/AIDS/STDs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad -

Its overall\n            objectives are to advance the onset of fertility decline by\n            increasing the use of modern methods of contraception, and\n            slow the spread of HIV infection by promoting behavioral\n            change. To attain these objectives, the project will support\n            policies and investments designed to: 1) reinforce the\n            national capacity to implement the national population\n            policy by a) strengthening the national capacity for\n            undertaking population-related activities; b) implementing a\n            community awareness program and dissemination of the\n            population policy; and c) supporting population-related\n            research; 2) strengthening the national capacity to contain\n            the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs by: a) institutional\n            strengthening of the Ministry of Public Health; and b)\n            supporting epidemiological, operational, and socio-economic\n            research; 3) putting in place a social marketing program for\n            the promotion of condoms; and 4) promoting the participation\n            of the private sector and NGOs in population, FP, and\n            HIV/AIDS/STD programs by setting up a social fund."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Population and AIDS Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad - Population and AIDS\n            Control Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/03/732769/chad-population-aids-control-project","projn":"TD-Population & Aids Control -- P035601","subtopic":"HIV AIDS,Adolescent Health,m,Health Information & Communications Technologies,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Chad","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970311121056"},"subsc":"Health,Other social services,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,AIDS\n            Control,AIDS Control Project,AIDS epidemic,AIDS\n            prevention,AIDS victims,births,child mortality,community\n            awareness,condom promotion,condom\n            use,condoms,contraception,contraceptive\n            prevalence,contraceptives,CURRENCY,families,Family\n            Planning,Family Welfare,high-risk,high-risk groups,HIV,HIV\n            infection,Human Immunodeficiency\n            Virus,Immunodeficiency,infant mortality,intervention,Life\n            expectancy,Life expectancy at birth,live births,living\n            conditions,malnutrition,morbidity,mortality,mortality\n            rate,National AIDS Control,orphans,parasitic\n            diseases,patients,population growth,pregnancy,private\n            sector,Public Health,sexually transmitted diseases,social\n            marketing,social services,STDs,TFR,Total Fertility Rate,transmission"},"1":{"cdata!":"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome,AIDS\n            Control,AIDS Control Project,AIDS epidemic,AIDS\n            prevention,AIDS victims,births,child mortality,community\n            awareness,condom promotion,condom\n            use,condoms,contraception,contraceptive\n            prevalence,contraceptives,CURRENCY,families,Family\n            Planning,Family Welfare,high-risk,high-risk groups,HIV,HIV\n            infection,Human Immunodeficiency\n            Virus,Immunodeficiency,infant mortality,intervention,Life\n            expectancy,Life expectancy at birth,live births,living\n            conditions,malnutrition,morbidity,mortality,mortality\n            rate,National AIDS Control,orphans,parasitic\n            diseases,patients,population growth,pregnancy,private\n            sector,Public Health,sexually transmitted diseases,social\n            marketing,social services,STDs,TFR,Total Fertility Rate,transmission"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF024991-FRENCH CTF (FY97 ALLOCATIONS)","repnb":"P6512"},"facets":{}}}
