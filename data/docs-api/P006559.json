Regardless of success,\n            some of the lessons of experience provide the following\n            findings, and suggestions. In this project, the first type\n            of risk seemed mitigated by the fact that some basic\n            pre-concession studies, including a concession modeling, had\n            already been implemented under the previous urban transport\n            project, and, to mitigate the risk of political opposition,\n            namely by the unions, dated covenants for issuing\n            pre-qualification documents and concession awarding, were\n            included in the loan agreement. However, it is not\n            sufficient to include dated covenants in the loan agreement;\n            rather a concrete and irreversible political step in this\n            direction should already be given before project\n            negotiation. Furthermore, creating a new and formal entity,\n            to which the constituting agencies have to cede some of\n            their authority and powers, requires more than the presence\n            of a \"collaborative environment\". It needs an\n            understanding at the political level, currently expected to\n            happen because both the State and the Municipality of Sao\n            Paulo found a common cause in the integration of the\n            municipal buses with the metro. Regarding the formal\n            integration with the Minibus System which provides services,\n            also create a strong competition for regular public\n            transport operators, and so put the viability of less\n            polluting and more space efficient systems at stake; a fight\n            against this phenomenon is no easy battle. The reason for\n            this success lies in the nature of the solution, which did\n            not consist in repression of the informal services, but\n            their constructive inclusion, as much as possible, into the\n            formal urban transport system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Integrated Urban Transport Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Integrated Urban\n            Transport Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6040283/brazil-integrated-urban-transport-project","projn":"BR-(Bf-R)Sp.Tsp -- P006559","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050701142200"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"General transportation sector,Sub-national government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to employment, access tracks,\n            accessibility, accidents, accounting, air quality, Bank\n            Performance, basic, Bus Company, bus lines, bus networks,\n            bus system, buses, calibration, cars, categories of\n            passengers, City Governments, Civil Works, commuter rail,\n            computerization, congestion, construction, debt,\n            Decentralization, dos, emission, escalators, express train,\n            fare evasion, fare integration, feeder services, financial\n            management, financial planning, FISCAL YEAR, flat tariff,\n            free transport, headway, housing, income, informal\n            Transport, Institutional Development, inventory, journey,\n            key performance indicators, lamp posts, land use, low income\n            passengers, low-income households, low-income residents,\n            low-income users, macroeconomic stability, metro line, metro\n            network, metro system, Metropolitan Transport, migration,\n            minibus, minibus operators, minibuses, mobility, modal\n            integration, motorized transport, Municipal governments, Net\n            Present Value, noise, operational revenues, passenger,\n            passenger trains, passengers per day, PCU, police, private\n            sector participation, Privatization, Public Transport,\n            Public Transport Operators, public transport passengers,\n            public transport system, public transport vehicles, rail\n            link, rail operations, railway, railway operator, Railways,\n            Rate of Return, resource allocation, roads, rolling stock,\n            safety, savings, sidewalks, speed, stations, streets,\n            suburban railways, technical assistance, terminals, track,\n            tracks, traffic, traffic control, traffic supervision,\n            trains, transit systems, transport projects, transportation,\n            travel time, trucks, urban development, urban mobility,\n            urban rail, urban rail system, urban rail systems, urban\n            services, Urban Train, URBAN TRANSPORT, urban transport\n            integration, URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT, urban transport\n            projects, urban transport sector, vehicle emissions,\n            vehicles, waiting time, work trip"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020710-SPANISH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020765-CANADIAN 'GENERAL'\n            CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF025255-PHRD-SAO PAULO INTEG.
