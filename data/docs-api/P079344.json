Information and Communication\n            Technology Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The overall outcome rating of the\n            Information and Communication Technology Development Project\n            for Vietnam was judged to be moderately unsatisfactory.  The\n            Bank and borrower performance were moderately\n            unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome was\n            substantial. Significant changes included revised\n            components, restructuring and amendments. Several lessons\n            were learned. The complexity of project design needs to be\n            balanced carefully against the client's human resource\n            endowment and readiness to execute. Multi-unit institutional\n            arrangements, if unavoidable, demand that the Bank negotiate\n            mechanisms for joint management of essential functions and\n            structured opportunities for collaboration. The objective is\n            to avoid duplication of operational and administrative\n            efforts, inefficiencies, and other well-known\n            \"silo\" effects. Cancellation would have limited\n            the knowledge gained from implementing this important\n            project but restructuring and extending it in 2010 without\n            addressing design issues was an inefficient use of Bank\n            resources. Bank procurement requirements, processes and\n            documents are not optimal for the fast-evolving IT sector\n            and this needs review. Intervention of senior Bank\n            management with national authorities can galvanize project\n            performance in a failing situation. ICT projects need to\n            focus on both the supply and demand sides, the latter being\n            an important driver of longer-term sustainability.  The\n            rationale for including weighty private sector goals in a\n            foundational project focused on e-government should be\n            clearly defined.  ICT projects can materially impact the\n            behavior and performance of government, business and\n            citizens and require the same high standards of monitoring\n            and evaluation design and execution as projects in other\n            sectors. It is unrealistic to expect that the deeper impacts\n            of newly-constructed ICT systems can be measured by end-project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Information and Communication\n            Technology Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam -

In order to garner an initial assessment of the\n            results and impact and to realize the benefits of the\n            project, an extension of two years is recommended. The Bank\n            Task Team has reviewed the Project Implementation Units\n            (PIUs') revised procurement and training plan to\n            complete the ongoing contracts and consider it achievable\n            within the proposed extension time. This will be the first\n            extension of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Information and\n            Communication Technologies (ICT) Development Project :\n            restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14639768/vietnam-information-communication-technologies-ict-development-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"VN-Vietnam - Ict Development -- P079344","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Decentralization,Housing & Human Habitats,Business Development Services","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20110725004542"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financing Plan, government services, ICT,\n            ID, Implementing Agency, private sector, private sector\n            development, public service delivery, service delivery, transparency"}},"owner":"Information & Communication Tech (TWICT)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF030386-JAPAN CTF - FY03 GENERAL: EAP\n            (ALL COUNTRIES IN EAST ASIA AND PACIFIC/A,TF052418-PHRD-VIETNAM: ICT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","repnb":"62973"},"facets":{}}}
