Negative environmental impacts will be\n            alleviated by the following mitigation measures: Soil\n            degradation will be reduced by watershed management\n            activities that control erosion (using fast-growing tree\n            crops, stabilizing exposed soil with grasses or other ground\n            covering, designing terraces on hillsides), projects which\n            encourage composting, activities to control forest and bush\n            fires, increasing drought preparedness, and improving\n            management of communal grazing. Deforestation will be\n            reduced by establishing community managed wood lots and\n            forestry management, employing reforestation, establishing\n            tree nurseries, improving use of fuel resources, and\n            creating greenbelts in urban areas.
