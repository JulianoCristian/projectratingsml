Four main lessons\n            stipulate the following. First, given water supply and\n            sewerage projects play a central role in reaching the\n            Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the project should have\n            been more precise in identifying the number of project\n            beneficiaries, instead of focusing on the implementation of\n            the large capital investment program, in contrast to the\n            ultimate objectives of the project: to improve the\n            environmental and health situation in Mumbai. It would have\n            been more effective to provide benefits to the population,\n            had it considered how the Mumbai population would receive\n            water service; how the wastewater would be collected, how it\n            would be transported to treatment works, and finally\n            disposed of. Refocusing the project as suggested, would\n            likely have resulted in the inclusion of efforts to manage\n            water demand, thus minimizing the quantity of wastewater\n            produced. Second, successive Bank projects to the same\n            borrower, should make an effort to advance in parallel\n            between capital investment financing, and policy reform. In\n            this project (the fourth project to Mumbai) its design could\n            have promoted a closer integration between the water supply\n            and sewerage sections of the Water Supply and Sewerage\n            Department (WSSD), and the related measures to raise the\n            autonomy and accountability of its activities. As it\n            happened, the project design did not aim at reforming the\n            WSSD organization, to update its tariff policies, to set\n            performance standards, and to provide staff incentives in\n            reaching targets. Third, the success of the slum sanitation\n            program (SSP) confirms once again the need to improve the\n            health, and well-being of the poorest populations: an\n            organization in a demand driven approach shows the program\n            can be expected to be sustainable, and yield important\n            demonstration effects. And, fourth, the importance of\n            quality at entry, demonstrates how by surmounting\n            objectives, as well as limitations, can fully turn a poorly\n            prepared project into success."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
