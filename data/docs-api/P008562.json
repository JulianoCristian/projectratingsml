The principal conclusions from\n            the audit relate to the longer term issues of funding in\n            support of global biodiversity, the use of the gene bank,\n            and the importance of the institutional background to the\n            project. The issue of funding global biodiversity,\n            regardless of honors granted by international agencies, and\n            nongovernmental organizations, including the Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF), remains financially unresolved\n            for the long term. This leads to question how incremental\n            costs, required to achieve global benefits, are to be\n            covered, since the principal costs are ongoing maintenance\n            of the resources, rather than one-time investments. Thus, it\n            is found appropriate for the GEF to raise this issue,\n            highlighted by project reviews. The substantial investment\n            the Gene Bank already is, and its degree of sophistication,\n            and considerable expertise in the maintenance of perennial\n            plant germ-plasm, suggest it may be time for the GEF to\n            consider how this type of facility fits into its overall\n            program of protection of species, and genetic material, and\n            how useful it may be for the international plant research\n            community. The apparent structure of research funding in the\n            former socialist countries, seems to provide too large a\n            role to the academies of science, which view research from\n            an academic viewpoint, rather than from a problem-solving\n            perspective, and consequently results did not develop\n            operational programs, inconsistent with project objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -

Some lessons learned\n            included: the project was intended to test a balance of\n            in-situ and ex-situ conservation, depending upon the\n            imminence of the threat on the environment. To date, it has\n            demonstrated that in-situ conservation is more\n            cost-effective than ex-situ conservation, and that the time\n            horizon of the threat and outside social and economic forces\n            are factors to consider when allocating scarce resources.\n            Furthermore, it teaches that without directly linking\n            in-situ restoration activities to ex-situ conservation, the\n            usefulness of the latter is jeopardized.
