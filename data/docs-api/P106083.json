The PRSF series has\n            provided important support to the Government to\n            operationalize its ambitious medium-term development\n            strategy i.e., the economic development and poverty\n            reduction strategy (EDPRS) by translating its objectives\n            into priority actions. The PRSF series provided substantial\n            financing to Rwanda's budget, including during the 2008\n            crisis. It was successful in fostering better donor\n            coordination, improved harmonization and reinforced support\n            for reforms among the country's budget support donors:\n            the World Bank, African Development Bank, and bilateral\n            donors -all partners in the Budget Support Harmonization\n            Group and part of the semi-annual joint budget support\n            reviews (JBSR). PRSF series focused on capacity building,\n            including sub-national levels of government in planning. The\n            success of the PRSF series was also largely helped by its\n            ability to base its design on strong sector dialogue. This\n            has helped to: (i) ensure the PRSF reflects substantive\n            policy agreements reached at the sector level; (ii)\n            strengthen the capacity of sector ministries to present\n            their needs and priorities during national level policy\n            discussions and budget negotiations; and (iii) facilitate\n            coordination of the Bank's inputs into the common\n            performance assessment framework (CPAF) policy discussions\n            in a timely manner. Considering the preparation and\n            implementation of the series coincided with the CPAF\n            establishment in 2008, this period can be regarded as a\n            transition or learning period for all parties involved in\n            budget support in Rwanda. Also, growing mutual understanding\n            of what each partner would need to get out of the process\n            helped it to become smoother over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Rwanda -

decentralization reforms. PRSG-5\n            is the second operation in the second series of PRSGs.\n            PRSG-5 focuses on reforms to ease human capital and\n            infrastructure constraints to growth, foster fiscal\n            decentralization, and strengthen the results orientation of\n            the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the budget\n            process.

decentralization\n            reforms. Within this context, the PRSG-4 is expected to help\n            the GoR to : 1) maintain a stable macroeconomic framework,\n            put in place reforms to ease the human capital and\n            infrastructure constraints to growth, with the aim of\n            creating a strong basis for private sector-led economic\n            growth, driven by agricultural transformation, promotion of\n            exports, deepening of the financial sector, and the use o f\n            information communications technology; 2) strengthen further\n            the linkages between strategic planning and the Medium-Term\n            Expenditure Framework (MTEF), by broadening the focus on\n            service delivery to include more strongly the agriculture,\n            transport, and financial sectors, while continuing to\n            maintain and deepen the progress made in the education,\n            health, water, and energy sectors; and 3) continue improving\n            governance and transparency through capacity support to\n            enable implementation of completed reforms to financial\n            management, and the budget and procurement frameworks, with\n            a particular emphasis on strengthening the process of fiscal\n            decentralization. Expected benefits are as follows: 1) in\n            creased access to infrastructure services while continuing\n            to consolidate and improve access to education and health\n            services to increase the supply of skilled labor in the\n            workforce; 2) improved efficiency of spending by supporting\n            reforms to strengthen the MTEF and public procurement\n            process; 3) strengthened capacity to implement through\n            support to civil service reforms to improve ministerial\n            structures and provide incentives to staff, increase skills\n            of the civil service and reduce turn-over."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Fourth Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda -
