For the NWFP Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project, project outcome is moderately\n            satisfactory; sustainability is likely; institutional\n            development impact is modest; overall Bank performance is\n            satisfactory; and overall Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory.

The main lessons\n            from these projects are: 1) Operations at the sub-national\n            level are a useful complement to those at the national\n            level. In terms of contributing to improved delivery of\n            service and poverty reduction, they compare favorably with\n            the Social Action Program. 2) Unless the mechanisms\n            governing the financial relationships between the federal\n            and provincial governments are revised, there is little or\n            no prospect for the provinces to be able to fulfill their\n            social mandate as provided by the Constitution and the\n            devolution plan in a sustainable manner. 3) Capacity at the\n            lower level is generally very weak since power resides at\n            the center for historical reasons. The focus, content, and\n            design of sub-national operations should target capacity and\n            institutional building at that level in conjunction with the\n            transfer of responsibilities from the higher to the lower\n            level. 4) When designing sub-national operations, joint\n            discussions with the central government are indispensable\n            for success. 5) Ownership and commitment, at the political\n            as well as at the administrative level, are keys to success.\n            6) Given the weak local capacity, emphasis should be placed\n            not only on building institutional capacity and training,\n            but also on incentives to encourage staff to learn and\n            assume greater responsibility. 7) Sub-national operations\n            should be accompanied by well designed and well focused\n            technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

The lessons\n            learned indicate that it is better to proceed with a reform\n            program credit even if there are the risks of first-time\n            lending to a sub-national borrower, new elections and other\n            risks, if there is borrower ownership. An accompanying\n            Technical Assistant project would enhance the effectiveness\n            of subsequent Structural Adjustment Credits (SACs). The\n            North West Frontier Province (NWFP) reform program is\n            comprehensive and complex and there are a number of areas\n            where sustained expertise and capacity building would be of\n            great benefit. The slow implementation in some areas shows\n            the need to strengthen implementation capacity, among other\n            things through technical assistance. The ramifications of\n            judicial reforms and devolution must be reasonably well\n            understood before their implementation. The Bank and other\n            donors noted the constitutional requirement for a judiciary\n            separate from the executive branch, but did not fully take\n            into account the vacuum created by abolishing the Magistrate\n            (as part of the program of Devolution, not specifically the\n            SAC) as an arbiter of average citizen's disputes or as\n            a mediator between the public and the police. Violence has\n            erupted between the police and the public in NWFP with\n            considerable loss of life. Family courts and minor civil\n            courts should be established expeditiously to compensate for\n            the loss of the Magistrate's judicial role."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

However, major risks are failure to continue\n            the political commitment to the reform process in the\n            Province in light of the October 2002 forthcoming elections;\n
