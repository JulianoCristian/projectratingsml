improve road safety; and (c)\n            continue the efforts to strengthen the government's\n            road maintenance operation, increase the private sector\n            participation and establish appropriate road planning and\n            management. The project consists of:  (a) a 3-year road\n            maintenance program for (i) periodic maintenance of about\n            226 km of paved roads; (ii) improvement and reconstruction\n            of unsafe bridges and retaining walls; (iii) routine\n            maintenance of the entire paved road network; and (iv)\n            repair of the earth road network to keep it open to traffic;\n            (b) improvement of road safety through road marking and\n            signing; and (c) institutional support to the General Public\n            Works Directorate including technical assistance, assistance\n            in creating a planning and study unit, and training.  The\n            project also finances spare parts and the partial renewal of\n            critical maintenance equipment to be utilized in force\n            account operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Comoros - Highway Maintenance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Comoros - Highway Maintenance
