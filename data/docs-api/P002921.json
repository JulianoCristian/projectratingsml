An agronomic research\n            unit was established towards the end of the project. Cane\n            variety development requires a long lead time for testing\n            and propagating improved adaptivevarieties, and this should\n            have been addressed in the early stages of the\n            project'simplementation; iii) creation of a working\n            partnership between Government and international\n            financinginstitutions with joint venture participation with\n            the private sector in implementation can lead to successful\n            results; and iv)replacement of expatriate staff by Ugandan\n            nationals was envisaged under the project. Despite\n            implementing staffing development and training programs,\n            this was not fullyachieved. Constraints not visualized in\n            this case, included the difficulty in attractingqualified\n            Ugandans from townships or from overseas, to rural areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -
