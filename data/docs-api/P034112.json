This rating is based on the fact that all\n            critical objectives were attained and this was done in the\n            face of numerous technical, institutional, ad political\n            obstacles. Given the difficult context in which\n            implementation occurred this is a considerable achievement.\n            The following lessons have been learned: There must be\n            strong ownership by and good dialogue with the Borrower and\n            its constituent organizations if necessary implementation\n            decisions are to be taken on a timely basis. Capacity\n            building takes a long time, requires much patience, and\n            requires a disproportionate commitment of Bank staff time\n            and supervision resources. There is an inherent tension\n            between the need to build capacity and the need to get the\n            job done. However, the longer-term systemic issues should\n            not be overlooked. Adequate \"slack\" time must be\n            provided for if the vicissitudes of border closures )\n            political risks) are to be weathered. The provision of\n            operating support to implementing units is critical to\n            establishing managerial and technical capacity. Close\n            on-the-ground supervision and willingness to be flexible in\n            adapting the project to local realities is essential. It can\n            also contribute significantly to mitigating risks. Finally,\n            it has been demonstrated that senior management's\n            decision to decentralize responsibilities to the field can\n            yield significant benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - First Emergency\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - First\n            Emergency Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728436/west-bank-gaza-first-emergency-rehabilitation-project","projn":"GZ-Ot - Emergency Rehab.
