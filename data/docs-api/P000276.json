Key lessons\n            convey that prospects for privatization of transport\n            services (even in difficult economic times) may succeed in\n            rail, road maintenance, and air transport service instances,\n            due to their high potential to operate commercially;\n            however, urban transport, particularly if under highly\n            subsidized services, would be especially difficult to\n            privatize. Furthermore, the human and financial resources\n            constraints faced by low-income countries in establishing\n            regulatory agencies may prove difficult; but Burkina's\n            policy of retaining minority ownership, may prove a suitable\n            substitute, if any temporarily. Once the privatization\n            process is launched, the government and co-financiers should\n            work in parallel to plan, and assist in the restructuring of\n            central government agencies, a role likely to change for\n            agencies after privatization; thus, the Bank should seek\n            financing in a flexible way, in order to reallocate funding\n            as needed toward technical assistance. Countries should\n            select measurement techniques for road conditions - an\n            appropriate outcome indicator of road programs - taking into\n            consideration both capital and recurrent high costs of\n            measuring road conditions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Transport Sector Adjustment\n            Investment Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Transport Sector\n            Adjustment Investment Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/03/2230524/burkina-faso-transport-sector-adjustment-investment-program-project","projn":"BF-Transport Secal -- P000276","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Urban Transport,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Burkina Faso","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03041804125366"},"subsc":"Railways,Central government administration,Roads and highways,Aviation","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,agriculture,air\n            transport,assets,audits,Bank management,Bank\n            performance,bus,bus\n            system,buses,cars,concessions,concrete,cost of capital,earth\n            roads,economic growth,economic\n            reform,EIB,employment,finances,financial performance,Fiscal\n            Year,framework,Freight traffic,government\n            agencies,gravel,gravel roads,Housing,income,institutional\n            development,liquidation,natural resources,net benefits,paved\n            roads,pavement,paving,PCU,peer review,periodic\n            maintenance,police,ports,Poverty Reduction,private\n            operators,private sector contracting,Privatization,public\n            enterprises,public expenditures,public transport,public\n            utilities,railways,rate of return,regulatory\n            framework,retirement,road improvements,road investment,road\n            investments,Road Maintenance,road rehabilitation,road\n            sector,road system,road transport,roads,routes,routine\n            maintenance,Rural transport,savings,Structural\n            Adjustment,supervision,sustainability,technical\n            assistance,traffic,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport projects,Transport\n            Sector,trucking,Urban Transport,Urban transport services"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,agriculture,air\n            transport,assets,audits,Bank management,Bank\n            performance,bus,bus\n            system,buses,cars,concessions,concrete,cost of capital,earth\n            roads,economic growth,economic\n            reform,EIB,employment,finances,financial performance,Fiscal\n            Year,framework,Freight traffic,government\n            agencies,gravel,gravel roads,Housing,income,institutional\n            development,liquidation,natural resources,net benefits,paved\n            roads,pavement,paving,PCU,peer review,periodic\n            maintenance,police,ports,Poverty Reduction,private\n            operators,private sector contracting,Privatization,public\n            enterprises,public expenditures,public transport,public\n            utilities,railways,rate of return,regulatory\n            framework,retirement,road improvements,road investment,road\n            investments,Road Maintenance,road rehabilitation,road\n            sector,road system,road transport,roads,routes,routine\n            maintenance,Rural transport,savings,Structural\n            Adjustment,supervision,sustainability,technical\n            assistance,traffic,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport projects,Transport\n            Sector,trucking,Urban Transport,Urban transport services"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026340-BELGIUM-URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT.

The particularly strong\n            performance by the Bank, during supervision, and the reforms\n            achieved - exceeding expectations - is assessed as highly\n            satisfactory, and, the Borrower's performance, given\n            the successful privatization, is rated satisfactory. Key\n            lessons address particularly, the potential difficulties in\n            achieving institutional, or other types of reform, where a\n            flexible supervision can make a difference: this project\n            supervision missions opted for privatization, rather than\n            restructuring parastatals, which evolved into profound, and\n            sustainable results. In addition, experience in performance\n            contracts for improving parastatal agencies efficiency, has\n            demonstrated that incentives, and political will is often\n            lacking in this type of reform, regardless of well conceived\n            plans. But preservation of road assets should be focused on\n            periodic maintenance, to avoid funding uneconomic projects;\n            i.e., road investment plans should prioritize maintenance,\n            ranking investments in accordance with the expected internal\n            rate of return (IRR). However, the lack of structured, donor\n            coordination proved vulnerable to the objections on road\n            maintenance finance at the economic criteria standards\n            agreed upon, a factor which would have greatly benefited\n            funding. It is suggested that Sector Investment Programs be\n            considered, if there is enough leverage to deepen\n            institutional development reforms, and, provided performance\n            indicators are linked to donor financing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Transport Sector Adjustment\n            Investment Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Transport Sector\n            Adjustment Investment Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/12/1089440/burkina-faso-transport-sector-adjustment-investment-program-project","projn":"BF-Transport Secal -- P000276","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Urban Transport,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Burkina Faso","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0104101108390"},"subsc":"Roads and highways,Aviation,Railways,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actual cost,air transport,Automobiles,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,book value,Bus,Bus Company,Bus\n            operations,bus services,Bus Transport,civil\n            service,consolidation,deficits,drivers,drivers\n            licensing,driving,driving instructors,earth roads,economic\n            growth,employment,financial management,financial\n            restructuring,FISCAL YEAR,Framework,Government\n            agencies,gravel,highway maintenance,Housing,improving road\n            safety,Institutional Development,Islamic Development\n            Bank,liquidation,mobility,passenger,passenger\n            transport,paved roads,PCU,performance indicators,periodic\n            maintenance,private operators,privatization,public\n            transport,rail transport,Railways,rate of return,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,road assets,road conditions,road\n            construction,road improvements,road investment,road\n            investments,Road Maintenance,road management,road\n            rehabilitation,Road Safety,road sector,road surfaces,road\n            system,road traffic,road transport,Roads,routine\n            maintenance,rural areas,Structural\n            Adjustment,subsidiary,Sustainability,technical\n            assistance,traffic counts,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport planning,Transport\n            Sector,Transportation,unpaved roads,urban bus,urban bus\n            transport,Urban Development,urban traffic,Urban\n            Transport,urban transport policy,vehicle registration,vehicles"},"1":{"cdata!":"actual cost,air transport,Automobiles,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,book value,Bus,Bus Company,Bus\n            operations,bus services,Bus Transport,civil\n            service,consolidation,deficits,drivers,drivers\n            licensing,driving,driving instructors,earth roads,economic\n            growth,employment,financial management,financial\n            restructuring,FISCAL YEAR,Framework,Government\n            agencies,gravel,highway maintenance,Housing,improving road\n            safety,Institutional Development,Islamic Development\n            Bank,liquidation,mobility,passenger,passenger\n            transport,paved roads,PCU,performance indicators,periodic\n            maintenance,private operators,privatization,public\n            transport,rail transport,Railways,rate of return,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,road assets,road conditions,road\n            construction,road improvements,road investment,road\n            investments,Road Maintenance,road management,road\n            rehabilitation,Road Safety,road sector,road surfaces,road\n            system,road traffic,road transport,Roads,routine\n            maintenance,rural areas,Structural\n            Adjustment,subsidiary,Sustainability,technical\n            assistance,traffic counts,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,transport planning,Transport\n            Sector,Transportation,unpaved roads,urban bus,urban bus\n            transport,Urban Development,urban traffic,Urban\n            Transport,urban transport policy,vehicle registration,vehicles"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026340-BELGIUM-URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT.
