The lessons learned indicate that\n            conditions such as retrenching civil servants, or\n            implementing an action plan are intermediate indicators,\n            should be clearly specified in the program matrix.\n            Far-reaching reforms, especially those requiring approval of\n            parliament, require time to build support among key\n            stakeholders. Assessing government commitment to reform is\n            difficult, particularly when key decision-makers, such as\n            the minister of finance, profess their commitment to the\n            program. Understand the impact of the reforms on various\n            stakeholders and work with government to develop mitigation\n            strategies to gain support for reform. Focus on a limited\n            set of key reforms. Offer a series of annual single tranche\n            budget support credits, rather than multitranche operations.\n            Take care to build effective partnerships with the IMF and\n            other donors in designing and supervising policy based\n            lending operations. Consult with the parliament, civil\n            society, and other stakeholders in designing and\n            implementing the reform program, and develop an effective\n            communications strategy. Support increased participation of\n            the private sector in the economy through deregulation,\n            concessioning, and other forms of public-private\n            partnerships, rather than insisting on privatization of\n            specific enterprises."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Economic and Public Sector Reform\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Economic and Public\n            Sector Reform Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/01/5583483/kenya-economic-public-sector-reform-credit-project","projn":"KE-Kenya Economic & Public Sector Reform\n            -- P069501","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,National Governance","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050204093651"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Law and justice,General transportation sector,General education sector,Crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Education,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, bank accounts, Bank\n            management, Bank Performance, Bank supervision, banking\n            sector, budgeting, child mortality, civil servants, civil\n            service, climate, corruption, debt, Economic Management,\n            elections, enterprise reform, Ethics, expenditures,\n            financial management, financial restructuring, FISCAL YEAR,\n            government reform, health services, inflation, Institutional\n            Development, interest rates, laws, lawsuits, legislation,\n            Lessons Learned, local government, management information,\n            marketing, mortality, negotiations, parents, population\n            growth, private sector, privatization, procurement,\n            profitability, public enterprises, Public expenditure,\n            public policy, PUBLIC SECTOR, public spending, reform\n            Implementation, reform process, reforms, rehabilitation,\n            savings, secondary schools, Supervision, teams, technical\n            assistance, telephone services, top management,\n            transparency, transportation, vaccination, water supply"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 2 (AFTP2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Structural Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"30969"},"2779955":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/11/2779955/kenya-economic-public-sector-reform-credit-project-release-second-tranche-waiver-two-conditions-amendment-development-credit-agreement","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/11/2779955/kenya-economic-public-sector-reform-credit-project-release-second-tranche-waiver-two-conditions-amendment-development-credit-agreement","new_url":"2003/11/2779955/kenya-economic-public-sector-reform-credit-project-release-second-tranche-waiver-two-conditions-amendment-development-credit-agreement","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/11/20/000012009_20031120105604/Rendered/INDEX/273330KE.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/11/20/000012009_20031120105604/Rendered/PDF/273330KE.pdf","credit_no":"3406","docdt":"2003-11-14T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2003-11-20T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Economic and Public Sector Reform\n            Credit Project : release of second tranche and waiver of two\n            conditions and amendment of Development Credit Agreement"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Economic and Public Sector Reform\n            Credit Project was prepared to assist the government\n            jumpstart the implementation of Kenya's Interim Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), and, to improve the\n            outlook for economic growth, and poverty reduction in the\n            medium term, initially by containing the fragile\n            macroeconomic situation, and fiscal difficulties. Although\n            macroeconomic stability masks significant structural\n            weaknesses in the economy, and, from a policy viewpoint, the\n            structure of public spending seemingly favors a recurrent\n            wage-bill expenditure, leaving little for investment in\n            physical, human capital, and services delivery, commitments\n            nonetheless, to improving the economic governance framework\n            are strong, much beyond the conditionality of the Credit.\n            Ten conditions regarding institutional auditing reforms,\n            financial regulations to improve the budget process, the\n            transparency of public spending, donor finance payments, the\n            procurement process, the legal framework on privatization of\n            public utilities, and, some legal and judicial reforms have\n            been met.

based on the fact that substantial retrenchment was\n            achieved, and that, while core poverty expenditures have\n            been technically difficult (in a way not fully appreciated\n

         Government's interim poverty reduction strategy paper\n            (IPRSP). The IPRSP aims to improve the living conditions for\n            Kenyans through measures to promote broad-based growth and\n            poverty reduction by encouraging income-generating\n            activities and improved access to basic social services. The\n            credit will focus on a) improvement in the governance\n            framework, particularly in areas that will improve\n            transparency and prudential over-sight of government\n            spending, and b) introduction of a budget consistent with\n            the resource envelope constraints determined by a realistic\n            medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). c) Related to the\n            MTEF, a shift is envisaged in the composition of public\n            expenditure towards the priority poverty reduction programs\n            identified in the forthcoming full PRSP. Other core areas\n            include: d) implementation of right-sizing of the civil\n            service, in line with the core functions of the government\n            and the priorities of the PRSP, and e) implementation of a\n            new and more ambitious privatization strategy. The credit\n            will improve the environment for economic governance and\n            strengthen market confidence so that both public and private\n            resources will be used
