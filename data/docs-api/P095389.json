Bank performance was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately unsatisfactory. Ratings for the District Heating\n            Project were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            unsatisfactory; risk to development outcome was significant.\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance\n            was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: a supportive regulatory environment is crucial for\n            overcoming risk aversion to adopting new financing\n            instruments for energy efficiency projects, creating a level\n            playing field for a competitive Energy Service Company\n            (ESCO) market, and to ensure sustainability of energy\n            services. Ensuring reliable means for verifying energy\n            savings provides a clear basis for sharing the resulting\n            gains between the beneficiary and the financing source, and\n            therefore incentivizes energy efficiency efforts. The Energy\n            Efficiency project was unable to stimulate the ESCO market\n            beyond some sectors in the public domain due to remaining\n            regulatory and legal constraints (as for example in the\n            residential sector). There is a need for the Government to\n            coordinate its various ministries in order to provide common\n            technical and other support services, with a view to\n            mitigating risks for investors and consumers in renewable\n            energy efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - Energy Efficiency Project;\n            Renewable Energy Resources Project;

Some lessons\n            learned included: commitment and ownership on the side of\n            the Borrower and implementing agencies are important for the\n            success of this project. This was demonstrated by the\n            capability of the Hrvatska Elektroprivreda Toplinarstvo (HEP\n            T) team, which implemented the project on time, even though\n            one year of implementation (2008) was lost due to a change\n            in the composition of its supervisory management board. A\n            key lesson for district heating projects in Europe and\n            Central Asia  (ECA) is that politically difficult decisions\n            on increasing heat tariffs should be an integral and\n            complementary part of the economic dialogue underpinnings\n            (DPLs) (as is the case in Ukraine and Moldova). A simple and\n            focused project design helps in effective implementation and\n            achieving the project objectives. It is important to have\n            continuity in the implementing agency's management\n            team. For example, HEP T's Supervisory Board was\n            changed after the change of government in 2008, and this\n            change caused a one year delay in project implementation due\n            to the new Board's unfamiliarity with the Bank's\n            procurement procedures. The size of procurement packages for\n            works (in this case for pipe installation works) should be\n            designed in such a way that several local companies have the\n            financial capability and implementation capacity to execute\n            them, thus allowing adequate competition. There should be\n            financial incentives for tenants to implement Demand Side\n            Management (DSM) measures in apartment buildings. As long as\n            the heat tariff is low and there is no incentive for\n            investment, apartment owners are not likely to be keen on\n            accepting voluntary Debt Management Section (DMS)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia - District Heating Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Croatia - District Heating

the level of customer satisfaction. The project\n            has two components : 1) the Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            component includes the following investments: Zagreb network\n            rehabilitation entails the replacement of a dual pipe trench\n            (35 km), transmission pipes (20 km), and distribution pipes\n            (15 km). These investments were identified as priority\n            rehabilitation investments where energy and water losses are\n            high; and, Osijek network rehabilitation entails the\n            replacement of distribution pipes (1 5 km) and connection to\n            the main combined heat power (CHP) plant of customers\n            currently connected to the inefficient local heat only\n            boilers. 2) the consulting services component includes: the\n            development of a demand side management (DSM) Program, where\n            HEPT will look at options to promote voluntary installation\n            of DSM equipment. The component further includes the\n            completion of two surveys in Zagreb and Osijek; preparation\n            of bidding documents; construction supervision; and,\n            preparation of annual audits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Croatia -
