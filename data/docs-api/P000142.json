The project's qualitative objectives was\n            accomplished. The absence of major problems during\n            implementation was due largely to the relative simplicity of\n            the project, but the evident lack of flexibility in the\n            Bank's interpretation of project objectives prevented\n            the Government from utilizing project savings to provide\n            more primary school classrooms. From this experience, the\n            project suggests the following lessons: To improve school\n            construction programs, a system of pre-qualifying registered\n            contractors should be set up; There should be an adequate\n            number of trained inspectors to strengthen the system of\n            quality control in civil works construction for schools; and\n            flexibility should be incorporated into project design to\n            permit changes in project scope so long as they are\n            consistent with project objectives. The Project was a\n            success in that it was fully implemented. It was a failure\n            inasmuch as a considerable portion of the original loan\n            amount could not be spent. Contributing to the\n            success/failure were macro-economic developments beyond the\n            control of both the Government and the World Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Botswana - Third Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Botswana - Third Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/12/738279/botswana-third-education-project","projn":"BW-Educ.
