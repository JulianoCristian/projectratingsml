The\n            following lessons are validated by similar experiences in\n            other participating states: 1) Effective poverty targeting\n            combines self-selection by beneficiaries with data-based\n            discrimination among rural poor communities geographical\n            targeting and strategic allocatation of project funds .  2)\n            Greater alignment of community investments with the United\n            Nations Human Development Index is both rational and\n            efficient. 3) Community-driven development  promotes social\n            capital formation: The demand-driven design of the Project\n            helps improve local governance by giving poor rural\n            communities a unique set of experiences in collective\n            action, priority-setting, decision-making, financial\n            management, and subproject operation and maintenance. 4)\n            Scaling up the program's impact on rural incomes\n            through productive investments remains a major challenge: 5)\n            A strategic approach which scales up use of participatory\n            methodologies to improve targeting, delivery and efficiency\n            of non-project resources while increasing the overall amount\n            of financing applied to complementary investments, has the\n            potential to increase poverty
