Key lessons learned include: 1) A project\n            management unit can be very effective but this does not\n            necessarily help develop Ministry of Health and Social\n            Affairs (MSAS) capacity. As a result, at project closing,\n            unless the project management unit staff is kept in the\n            administration, part of the investment is lost. 2) During\n            the implementation of the Plan Directeur the\n            government's capacity to coordinate donors was\n            insufficient. As a result, joint activity planning under the\n            government's leadership failed. 3) Some of the project\n            monitoring and evaluation indicators were rather general. As\n            a result, the outcome indicators chosen did not allow for\n            the assessment of the impact of the credit on the health\n            status of the population. 4) The project demonstrated that\n            cost recovery, when accompanied by real advantages for\n            patients, can lead to an increase in the use of public\n            health facilities. 5) Women play a major role in health\n            status improvement and in economic growth, and they are\n            capable of managing rather complex operations successfully.\n            6) The fact that communities were well organized and the\n            government was committed to decentralization proved to be a\n            real asset for the success of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania

The Government needs\n            assistance in articulating a national population policy and\n            defining a corresponding program of actions. There is an\n            urgent need to enhance women's abilities to participate\n            in and contribute to the country's social and economic\n            development. A heavy emphasis should be placed on policy\n            reforms related to the proposed investments which are\n            secured by specific project conditions. To achieve these\n            objectives the project would finance investments to: (a)\n            develop the regional health service system through (i)\n            development of training programs for regional personnel;\n            (ii) development of a maintenance system for vehicles,\n            equipment and infrastructure; (iii) strengthening of\n            financial management at the regional level; and (iv)\n            assistance for health services in the regions of Brakna,\n            Hodh el Gharbi, and Nouakchott; (b) strengthen capacity at\n            the central level to support regional health services\n            through (i) strengthening of technical capacity in three\n            programs of special emphasis - family planning, health\n            education, and nutrition; and (ii) improvement of management\n            systems for personnel, finance and health information; (c)\n            define a national population policy and its action plan and\n            assist in its implementation;
