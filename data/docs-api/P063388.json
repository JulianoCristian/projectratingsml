The loan was withdrawn as of November\n            11, 2001. this note reflects the fact that the withdrawal of\n            the loan took place before meaningful project\n            implementation. The main objective of the project was to\n            pilot the development of health insurance for the poor in\n            selected provinces by assisting the Government in developing\n            the legal, institutional and financial framework to\n            establish the proposed health insurance scheme which could\n            eventually have been replicated throughout the country. In\n            May 24, 2001, when the first deadline to sign the Loan\n            Agreement lapsed, the Government requested a three months\n            extension of the signing date, the Bank accepted and\n            extended the signing date to August 28, 2001. During the\n            three months extension the authorities of the Ministry of\n            Health took the necessary internal actions to review and\n            agree on the content of the Presidential Decree needed to\n            approved the terms of the Loan Agreement and proceeded with\n            the signing of the document. However, due to the delay in\n            issuing such Presidential Decree before August 28, 2001, the\n            Loan Agreement failed to be signed within the maximum period\n            established by the Bank's policies of 18 months after\n            the Board Approval. Consequently, the Bank's management\n            decided to withdraw the Loan as of November 11, 2001."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - Health Insurance for the Poor Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina -
