Lessons from the project experience\n            support the conclusion that a series of single-tranche\n            adjustment operations, anchored through a medium term reform\n            framework to reforming states, can be an effective\n            instrument to support reforms in India. From the effective\n            project design, policy lessons indicate that frequent, and\n            regular monitoring can lead to greater awareness of the\n            fiscal position, and risks, taking into account realistic\n            tax targets. However, improved forecasting of state output\n            is needed to make fiscal targets as a percentage of output,\n            more reliable, while public account financing should be\n            reduced over time, since financing from the public accounts\n            can distort the deficit numbers, and reduce budgetary\n            transparency. From the power sector perspective, it is\n            suggested that in light of electricity consumption being\n            subsidized, particularly when tariffs are de-linked from\n            consumption, regulation of power supply to subsidized\n            sectors is crucial as a transitional measure to restore the\n            sector's financial viability, even though one of the\n            aims of reforms is to let go of the need to limit power\n            supply. In turn, the creation of a power sector regulator,\n            complemented by integrated functions among the regulator,\n            utility, and government should ease the reform process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Karnataka Economic Restructguring\n            Loan/Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Karnataka Economic\n            Restructguring

Second, the\n            KERL's administrative reforms focus on civil service\n            reforms, freedom of information, service agency reforms,\n            anti-corruption initiatives, decentralization, and\n            e-governance, with the objectives of improving the\n            efficiency and transparency by which government conducts its\n            business and delivers services. Third, the private sector\n            development component focuses on improving the business\n            environment through deregulation and privatization/closure\n            of public enterprises. Finally, the KERL supports the\n            establishment of a poverty and human development monitoring\n            system to enable the state to better track the impact of its\n            services, policies, and reforms on poverty and social\n            indicators.
