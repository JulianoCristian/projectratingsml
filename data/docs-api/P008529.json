Key lessons learned include: 1)\n            It is important to put in place good management and a good\n            management structure in complex institution-building\n            projects. 2) This project suffers from misunderstanding of\n            complex Bank disbursement procedures. These added to the\n            transaction costs of the credit line and slowed down the\n            lending process. Both disbursement and procurement\n            procedures need to be simplified as far as possible. 3) In\n            terms of project design, the need for flexible management\n            and willingness to find solutions by refining the design are\n            important lessons of experience for all financial\n            intermediary loans (FILs). 4) The course correction came as\n            a result of good quality supervision which in turn benefited\n            from continuity. It is a feature of institution building\n            projects such as FILs that intensive continuous supervision\n            is essential. 5) The intervention of the Bank may not be\n            feasible in a highly competitive financial market. The\n            \"window of opportunity\" for the Bank needs to be\n            carefully judged, and speed is needed to take advantage of\n            it. 6) Where working capital finance is an integral part of\n            an enterprise's investment program, it should be\n            regarded as performing the same function as fixed capital."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Enterprise and

These reforms will pave the way for\n            improved intermediation through the banking sector. The\n            credit component of the loan will act as an incentive to the\n            development of intermediation at the medium- and long-term\n            end of the maturity spectrum. The project will have three\n            components: 1) a credit line component that will provide\n            resources for commercial banks to make medium- and long-term\n            loans to recently privatized and other private sector\n            Latvian enterprises for investment and related permanent\n            working needs; 2) an institutional development component\n            that will support the Latvian Privatization Agency by\n            financing an accelerated privatization track through open\n            auctions, and to also support the development of a Project\n            Management Unit and a Technical Unit; and 3) a financial\n            infrastructure investment component for computer hardware\n            and software for payments system development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Enterprise and Financial Sector\n            Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latvia - Enterprise and Financial\n            Sector Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/08/732902/latvia-enterprise-financial-sector-restructuring-project","projn":"LV-Enterprise & Financial Sector\n            Restructuring Project -- P008529","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Housing Finance,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Latvia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961006082212"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,Central government administration,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"balance sheet,bank capitalization,bank\n            lending,Bank Loans,Bank of Latvia,bank restructuring,banking\n            sector,banking system,bonds,Borrower,capital\n            formation,commercial banks,commitment,credit\n            line,disbursement,disbursements,employment,Exchange\n            Rates,expenditures,financial institutions,financial\n            restructuring,Financial Sector,Fiscal Year,GDP,government\n            bonds,grace period,Gross Domestic\n            Product,Guarantor,income,inflation,institutional\n            development,interest rate,interest\n            rates,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreements,LOAN AMOUNT,loan\n            effectiveness,Local Competitive\n            Bidding,maturities,maturity,metals,nominal interest\n            rates,nonperforming loans,Onlending,pollution,private\n            commercial banks,Privatization,real\n            sector,recapitalization,Redemption,Savings,specialized\n            banks,State Property,subborrowers,subloans,Technical\n            Assistance,TRANCHE,unallocated funds,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"balance sheet,bank capitalization,bank\n            lending,Bank Loans,Bank of Latvia,bank restructuring,banking\n            sector,banking system,bonds,Borrower,capital\n            formation,commercial banks,commitment,credit\n            line,disbursement,disbursements,employment,Exchange\n            Rates,expenditures,financial institutions,financial\n            restructuring,Financial Sector,Fiscal Year,GDP,government\n            bonds,grace period,Gross Domestic\n            Product,Guarantor,income,inflation,institutional\n            development,interest rate,interest\n            rates,legislation,LOAN,Loan Agreements,LOAN AMOUNT,loan\n            effectiveness,Local Competitive\n            Bidding,maturities,maturity,metals,nominal interest\n            rates,nonperforming loans,Onlending,pollution,private\n            commercial banks,Privatization,real\n            sector,recapitalization,Redemption,Savings,specialized\n            banks,State Property,subborrowers,subloans,Technical\n            Assistance,TRANCHE,unallocated funds,working capital"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024256-BALTIC-RIGA REGIONAL MISSION,TF034454-ECA REGION, MOLDOVA, LATVIA -\n            PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT,TF033403-ECA REGION  (MOLDOVA, LATVIA)\n            FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISE SECTOR,TF021483-ENTERPRISE & FINANCIAL\n            SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT,TF020018-ENTERPRISE AND FIN.
