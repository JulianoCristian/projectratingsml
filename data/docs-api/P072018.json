Some lessons learned\n            included: the focus of the project should not be limited to\n            the efficiency of the investments and completion of the\n            physical components and the associated outcomes. It is\n            important to maintain a vigorous dialogue with the\n            Government on broader policy issues and long-term strategy\n            for the growth of the sector. In a complex sector, such as\n            the power sector in Nigeria with many serious problems and\n            huge investment requirements, it is important to identify\n            the most critical constraints to efficient delivery of\n            services and address those first in order to get the maximum\n            impact from limited resources as well as limited\n            implementation capacity. TDP was designed to address the\n            most critical transmission and dispatch system problems, and\n            the later projects are focusing more on system efficiencies\n            and increasing gas to power supply in order to maximize\n            utilization of the existing operable generating capacity.\n            The indicators of project outcomes should be few but fully\n            reflective of the project development objectives (PDOs).\n            These indicators should be backed by an appropriate model or\n            a set of equations for computing the indicators with clear\n            identification of controlling and exogenous variables and\n            their impact. This should facilitate improved monitoring by\n            the implementing authorities, unambiguous evaluation of\n            performance at every stage, and identification of corrective action."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Transmission Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Transmission\n            Development

This Environmental Policy Framework\n            Evaluation (EPFE) examines the potential issues arising from\n            construction of new facilities: a) impact to biological\n            resources; b) impacts to human resources arising from\n            construction of new facilities; c) noise related to\n            construction and operation of large transformers; d) public\n            and workplace health and safety associated with past\n            management practices at existing substations, including the\n            use and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)\n            containing transformer oils; and e) contamination issues\n            associated with ongoing management of facilities. The five\n            existing locations all have sufficient land within existing\n            perimeters to accommodate the proposed facilities, and no\n            biological or social land use impacts are therefore\n            anticipated. No residence or sensitive receptors were noted\n            in close proximity to the substation sites, and so noise is\n            not considered an issue. Leakage and uncontrolled disposal\n            of PCB-containing oils has occurred at two existing\n            facilities, which may present a risk to workers at the\n            sites. To mitigate this, PCB tests will be conducted in all\n            facilities initially. If the presence of PCB is confirmed, a\n            Phase II audit will be conducted to develop new construction\n            plans for minimizing contamination and human exposure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria -
