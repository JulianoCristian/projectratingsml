The project\n            achieved its main objectives, institutional capacity was\n            strengthened, sustainability is likely with adequate\n            funding, and both the Bank and Borrower acted\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the need for indigenous hydrocarbons in\n            Nepal is great and efforts should continue to be made to\n            attract IOCs (International Oil Companies). The terms of\n            PSAs (Production Sharing Agreements) offered to oil\n            companies should be made as attractive as possible. Second,\n            it would be helpful if the regulations requiring a limited\n            period during which bids can be accepted is removed. Third,\n            the DMG (Department of Mines and Geology) should continue to\n            play a central role in coordinating donor financed efforts\n            and in finding means of continuing the promotion effort.\n            There are sufficient technical personnel in DMG to carry out\n            the routine work and their role in assembling and\n            reinterpreting data as it is acquired is critical. Lastly,\n            funding for technical assistance would be beneficial to\n            continue the supervision of ongoing exploration and efforts\n            to strengthen the DMG."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Petroleum Exploration\n            Promotion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/06/736505/nepal-petroleum-exploration-promotion-project","projn":"NP-Tech.Asst.

There has been virtually no exploration for petroleum\n            in Nepal except for limited surface geology surveys\n            undertaken during the 1960's. An IDA-financed\n            aeromagnetic survey in 1980 demonstrated the existence of\n            thick sedimentary zones and basement anomalies in the Terai\n            Basin which could be indicative of geologic strutures\n            capable of trapping hydrocarbons. However, while these\n            indications are encouraging, they are as yet too preliminary\n            to attract foreign oil companies to undertake exploration\n            work without the acquisition of substantial additional\n            geological and geophysical data. The project would consist\n            of: (i) a seismic survey of about 800 line-km in the Terai\n            Basin; (ii) preparation of draft petroleum legislation;\n            (iii) geochemical analysis and other studies; (iv)\n            exploration promotion; and (v) training of staff in geology,\n            geophysics and legal aspects of the petroleum industry. The\n            major benefit of the project would be to enhance the\n            attractiveness of Nepal as a petroleum prospect, thereby\n            encouraging foreign oil companies to undertake the most\n            costly phases of exploration. The project would also provide\n            temporary employment for some 400-500 laborers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Petroleum Exploration\n            Promotion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/05/723250/nepal-petroleum-exploration-promotion-project","projn":"NP-Tech.Asst.
