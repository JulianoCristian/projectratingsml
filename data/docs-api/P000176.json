The\n            physical objectives were largely achieved. The quality of\n            management and of output was good, and project supervision\n            was rated problem-free or with only minor problems\n            throughout the project cycle. The main implementation\n            problems were occasional late availability of counterpart\n            funds, land conflicts with the population, and the fact that\n            the project was mainly implemented by expatriates. The two\n            main objectives of the project were to strengthen the\n            Forestry Department and to promote tree planting. Training\n            was provided for some 80 middle-level forestry technicians,\n            and the project also financed vehicles and a headquarters\n            building for the Forestry Department. However, on the higher\n            or professional level, the project was less successful; it\n            only provided one two-year scholarship due to lack of\n            candidates. Regarding tree planting, the project established\n            81 nurseries which produced seedlings from which communal\n            and individual plantations were established. The\n            project's main sustainability problem during the first\n            phase was that it was mainly being implemented by\n            expatriates. However, the project was Burundized half-way\n            through the second phase in December 1988. Sustainability of\n            the project nurseries is reliant on the Forestry Department\n            becoming more active about marketing the output from its\n            industrial plantations. The primary lesson learned is that\n            obtaining land for industrial plantations in a densely\n            populated country like Burundi occasionally led to conflicts\n            with farmers and pastoralists. The second phase of the\n            project adjusted to this lesson by reducing the area of new\n            industrial plantations while placing greater emphasis on\n            agro-sylvo pastoralism."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
