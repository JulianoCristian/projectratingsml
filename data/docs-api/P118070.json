Some lessons learned\n            included: one of the lessons that can be drawn from this\n            operation is that considering the interests and political\n            strengths of various stakeholders and groups in the reform\n            process may help in tailoring successful reforms and provide\n            more realistic expectations of reform outcomes. Although the\n            reform progress remains gradual in Mexico, the Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL) supported reforms have been successful.\n            Ongoing engagement by the Bank in DPL supported policy areas\n            is crucial for measurement of the longer term developmental\n            impact. This is particularly significant in instances when\n            outcome indicators are not reflective of the full impact of\n            reform, or when methodological changes in indicator\n            measurement postpone data release. Despite the ease in\n            measurement of some quantitative indicators, such as the\n            expansion of outlets providing financial services, the true\n            impact of the increase will not be evident for some time. As\n            the Bank remains engaged on financial sector issues and\n            other development areas, it can help assist with the\n            construction indicators and monitor policy impact, such as\n            the ongoing financial inclusion survey conducted every three\n            years, to provide an informed basis to adjust policies to\n            enhance development outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Economic Policies in Response to\n            the Global Crisis Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Economic Policies

objective of the Economic Policies\n            in Response to the Global Crisis Development Policy Loan\n            Program for Mexico is to support economic policies to\n            mitigate the impact of the global crisis and strengthen the\n            medium-term framework for sustainable economic recovery and\n            growth. The program will contribute to achieving this\n            objective by further developing the regulatory, monitoring\n            and financial framework for fiscal and financial\n            sustainability, labor market efficiency, and trade\n            liberalization. The country shares a common border with the\n            United States, over which more than 80 percent of its\n            exports is exchanged. Millions of Mexican emigrants live in\n            the United States, and prior to the crisis, they sent home\n            over $25 billion per year in remittances. A number of\n            important financial institutions are subsidiaries of\n            international banks that were at the epicenter of the\n            financial crisis. Tourism and other service exports also\n            have the United States as a prime consumer. While the crisis\n            started in the United States, its impact has been more\n            heavily felt in many areas in Mexico. Trade has declined by\n            about 30 percent in the first half of the year. Remittances\n            have fallen substantially, 12.6 percent, in dollar terms, in\n            the first seven months of the year, and foreign investment,\n            direct and portfolio investment, declined by 45 percent in\n            the first half of 2009. The impact of these external factors\n            on the overall economy has been substantial: Gross Domestic\n            Product (GDP) in the first half of the year declined 9.2\n            percent compared to a year earlier and the Mexican economy\n            lost more than half a million jobs between June 2008 and\n            June 2009."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Economic Policies in
