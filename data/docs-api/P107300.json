Some important project lessons learned\n            were: (1) A results-based investment operation that\n            disburses against Disbursement Linked Indicator (DLIs) with\n            predefined implementation progress and performance targets\n            can be a good vehicle to influence medium-term reforms and\n            performance outcomes such as improved sector governance and\n            increased accountability, and help change the nature of the\n            dialogue to focus on development outcomes. (2) Strong\n            political commitment and ownership are critical for\n            successfully steering a sector wide reform program and for\n            addressing governance and accountability constraints to\n            effective service. (3) Continuous and intensive Bank\n            engagement across the reform program and technical and\n            advisory support can help keep momentum and provide the\n            needed support at critical points. (4) Simultaneous focus in\n            Sindh Education Sector Project (SEP) on inputs and reforms\n            to improve the quality of learning is likely to be more\n            beneficial in meeting the school participation objectives of\n            attracting and retaining both boys and girls in school. (5)\n            A realistic assessment of the capacity is important to\n            inform the design and sequencing of the reform programs for\n            optimal. (6) Regular diagnostic assessments for tracking\n            student achievement are good initial steps towards improving\n            student learning outcomes. (7) Availability of timely and\n            reliable data is essential for choosing the results\n            indicators to measure the achievement of the development objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Sindh Education Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Sindh Education Sector

Sector Project (SEP) of Pakistan is to support the\n            Government of Sindh's Medium Term Education Sector\n            Reform Program (SERP). The objectives of SERP are to\n            increase school participation, reduce gender and rural-urban\n            disparities, increase progression, and improve the\n            measurement of student learning. There are two components to\n            the project, the first component of the project being\n            financing of SERP.  This component finances key Eligible\n            Expenditure Programs (EEP) up to capped absolute amounts,\n            with disbursements based on the achievements of agreed\n            indicators. These disbursement linked indicators (DLI)\n            reflect intermediate outcome or implementation performance\n            indicators that are critical to the achievement of the\n            project's education development outcomes. The SERP\n            activities and sub-programs fall within four broad thrust\n            areas which aim to improve: 1) fiscal sustainability and the\n            effectiveness of public expenditures including in education;\n            2) education sector management; 3) access to quality\n            schooling with a particular focus on rural children and\n            girls; and 4) the quality of teaching and student learning.\n            The second component of the project is the technical\n            assistance.  This component finances capacity building and\n            strengthens fiduciary, safeguard, and monitoring and\n            evaluation systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Sindh Education Sector
