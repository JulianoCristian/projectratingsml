Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            There is a clear need for stronger monitoring and evaluation\n            of research projects. The lack of hard evidence about the\n            results of Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) investments in\n            research and extension is a considerable shortcoming of all\n            but one project. In each of these countries, agricultural\n            productivity has risen since the mid 1990s, with growth\n            increasingly based on intensification rather than area\n            expansion. All institutions need a portion of the budget\n            that is core funded to cover costs of maintenance and\n            upgrading of physical and human resource infrastructure. CGS\n            usually only fund operating costs and the subprojects they\n            finance have only 2-3 years' duration. The CGS model is\n            more likely to strengthen the strongest agencies providing\n            research and extension services than it is to reduce the\n            disparities between the strong and the weak. The principle\n            of competition between alternative service providers breaks\n            down where the range of providers is limited and many of the\n            potential providers lack the skills needed to prepare viable\n            sub-project proposals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Agricultural Technology and\n            Rural Education Project; Peru - Agricultural Research

For 7) Monitoring and\n            Evaluation goes beyond the Logical Framework. The indicators\n            identified in the Logical Framework need to be revised as a\n            project evolves during project implementation.
