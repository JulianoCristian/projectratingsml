The\n            institutional development impact of the Pilot was rated as\n            substantial, while that for the SECAL project was only\n            modest. World Bank and Borrower performances in both\n            projects were rated as satisfactory. Several lessons were\n            learned: Quick-disbursing SECALs are inappropriate vehicles\n            for supporting sector restructuring programs. SECALs in\n            support of mine closures should be designed with several\n            small, flexible tranches, rather than a small numberof large\n            tranches. Projects designed to support setor restructuring\n            should have a clear focus on poverty reduction objectives.\n            The financial and economic performance of pilot projects\n            activities needs to be carefully monitored. The Bank needs\n            to make greater efforts to help improve the eficiency of\n            mine closure activities. The Bank should consider working\n            more closely with other bilateral and multicultural agencies\n            that are providing seed money for establishing local\n            cooperatives

Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are overall\n            satisfactory. Lessons included the following: The pilot\n            operation was very useful in setting in motion a major\n            restructuring program--the mere fact that the pilot closure\n            was successful was sufficient to trigger an accelerated mine\n            closure program and thus substantially reduce the drain on\n            the national budget. In deviating from the best practice\n            norm, this project had several disbursement conditions for\n            different components, allowing fast processing and early\n            loan effectiveness, thus enabling the national economy to\n            reap the benefits of fast restructuring. Also, when it\n            became evident during implementation that micro-credits and\n            employment subsidies were ineffective social mitigation\n            measures at this time, the funds were shifted to public\n            works which, beside the positive temporary employment, had\n            added social benefits for the local public, and through the\n            goodwill created, contributed to keeping the pace of mine\n            closures. Triggered by difficulties met in financing social\n            assets transfers and the need to provide incentives for such\n            transfers and improve conditions in communities with closed\n            mines, the Bank's supervision team, in close\n            cooperation with the beneficiaries, developed the Municipal\n            Credit Line. Procedures that could improve mine closures\n            include sufficient preparation, splitting tasks, and\n            tailoring the agency for mine closures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Coal Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine -

The\n            project seeks to: 1) test ways to implement the\n            government's decision to close mines safely, with due\n            regard to technical, environmental, economic, financial and\n            social aspects; 2) ensure that mine workers are afforded\n            opportunities to either transfer to other jobs in the sector\n            or exit the industry with reasonable compensation and a\n            choice of assistance for seeking other employment; 3)\n            transfer social assets to municipal management, support\n            their rationalization and help ensure that adequate social\n            protection measures are put in place to support the most\n            vulnerable people; and 4) through monitoring and feedback,\n            gain experience from the project for subsequent bank\n            assistance operations in the sector. The project consists of\n            the following five components which will serve as the basic\n            framework for mitigation initiatives in subsequent sector\n            operations requested by the government: 1) mitigation of\n            mine closure including physical closure and environmental\n            mitigation; 2) social mitigation; 3) social infrastructure\n            divestiture; 4) institutional strengthening and job\n            counseling; and 5) technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Coal Pilot
