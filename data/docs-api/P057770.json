Some lessons learned included: to have the\n            desired impact and serve as a sustainable model, financing\n            of cultural site management plans should include priority\n            physical works identified in the plan. The approach in\n            Gondar versus Axum shows that this is essential if there is\n            to be a visible impact on improved visitor experience and if\n            the site is to serve as a space used by locals and\n            contributing to local economy. Lags between development plan\n            and financing plan result in dilution of impact, create\n            borrower fatigue, and seriously compromise the ability of\n            the investment. Venues developed for cultural commercial\n            activities should be located at key cultural sites.\n            Experience in Harar and Gondar compared to Addis Ababa shows\n            that tourists are unlikely to go to a venue just for craft\n            purchase from one outlet. Bringing together commercial\n            activities and cultural sites also increases turnover for\n            investment and the frequenting of the cultural site by local\n            residents. Exposure to international markets is necessary\n            but demanding in investment and time and currently has\n            limited potential to reach a large number of crafts people.\n            The regional bureaus of culture and tourism and city\n            administration need significant access to technical support\n            in cultural management. When national inventory and\n            information systems are developed, such as the computerized\n            inventory database, there should be a formalized commitment\n            to deliverables from the regions. Otherwise, as is the\n            current case, there is a risk that the equipment will be\n            used for other purposes and the staff deployed elsewhere,\n            thereby making the whole system dysfunctional."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Cultural Heritage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Cultural Heritage

the\n            project, amid the subsequent finding about the relocation of\n            7-8 households at the Ras Mengesha House in Axum, due to\n            project operations related to the third project component,\n            that is, Artisanal Crafts Development. This report presents\n            the findings and recommendations of the audit. The audit\n            confirmed that in line with World Bank Operational Policy\n            (OP 4.12), the 10 households relocated in Axum, were\n            involuntarily relocated as an adverse impact of project\n            activities. The 10 households are therefore eligible for\n            compensation in the form of: facilitation/provision of\n            equivalent or improved accommodation; full cost coverage for\n            transport of assets to the new location; a relocation\n            allowance and six months rental subsidies for increased\n            rental costs. Artisanal Crafts Development and the\n            re-establishment of ancient craft making traditions at Ras\n            Mengesha House or rather compound will not induce\n            \"land\" acquisition, per se. In Ethiopia, all land\n            belongs to the state. Private persons as well as legal\n            persons have usufruct rights, provided by the kebeles. The\n            kebele has the usufruct rights over the Ras Mengesha House.\n            The project has been granted access rights to the compound\n            and full usufruct rights to the facilities by the kebele.\n            Also confirmed was that in Axum the four components of the\n            project, will not induce land acquisition.  Ten (10)\n            households (47 persons) of which three female-headed\n            households have been relocated from the Ras Mengesha\n            compound as the facilities of the compound will be used for\n            preservation and re-establishment of ancient craft making\n            traditions. Seven (7) households were relocated by the\n            kebele (municipality) administration in September 2002. The\n            three households remain to be relocated. An abbreviated RAP\n            was prepared for these three remaining households: They have\n            been notified of their relocation and the Keble\n            administration will assist them in finding appropriate\n            rental houses within 300 meter radius of their current\n            location.
