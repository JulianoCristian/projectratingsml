The project would complement ongoing\n            exploration efforts being carried out with the assistance of\n            Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). It would comprise: (i)\n            complementary survey work, including marine seismic and\n            airborne magnetometer (airmag) surveys, required for a\n            complete review of the country's petroleum potential;\n            (ii) about 10 man-months of exploration consultant services,\n            to help review and interpret data and prepare an exploration\n            strategy; (iii) about 15 man-months of short term\n            consultancies to undertake specialized geological studies;\n            (iv) about 30 man-months of consultant services to help\n            develop a national energy data base and prepare a national\n            energy plan; (v) about 20 man-months of consultant services\n            to help prepare a study of options in the refining\n            subsector; and (vi) staff training and purchase of library\n            materials and specialized office equipment.
