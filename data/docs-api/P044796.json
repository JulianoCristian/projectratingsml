          satisfactory. The operations met the major objectives, and\n            sustainability is likely. The lessons learned indicate that\n            a highly educated background among policy people, is key for\n            a smooth and comprehensive reform program, as is the\n            continuity of both the counterpart and Bank's teams,\n            conveying far greater ownership. The composition of\n            supervision teams, when comprised of the core country team,\n            has the advantage of ensuring that SAC supported policies\n            will be directed towards sectoral priorities. Furthermore,\n            it is suggested that frequent supervisions by the core\n            country team, may be possible under the same SAC budget,\n            since the costs may be distributed among other sectoral\n            projects under their administration, in addition to the\n            added leverage advantage, off the adjustment operations\n            funds, to support their respective sector projects. The\n            pressure for financing gaps on tranche releases, may affect\n            policy considerations for their release, as was the case\n            with the second SAC operation. Thus, special consideration\n            should be given to premature releases, which may well weaken\n            compliance with the reform program. It is further suggested\n            to focus on intensive supervision, namely in new member\n            countries, to gain familiarity with Bank operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - First and

consolidate macroeconomic stability and to lay the\n            foundations for sustained private-sector led growth over the\n            medium term. The program includes measures to: 1) improve\n            financial discipline in the private and public sectors, so\n            as to increase domestic savings, facilitate further external\n            adjustment, and ensure Armenia's creditworthiness; 2)\n            accelerate the growth and development of the private sector;\n            and 3) ensure the social sustainability of the reform\n            process and preserve Armenia's stock of highly-skilled\n            human capital. The government's strategy to improve\n            financial discipline is based on actions in three critical\n            areas: strengthening its resource mobilization capacity,\n            deepening energy sector reforms, and extending these reforms\n            into other critical, energy-consuming public utilities. To\n            accelerate private sector development, the government will\n            focus on completing privatization, strengthening the banking\n            sector, and developing capital markets. The credit supports\n            measures to improve targeting of social benefits and to\n            strengthen the social safety net. The program also includes\n            actions to reform the public pension system, introduce\n            private pensions schemes, and ensure adequate and affordable\n            long-term protection to the elderly. Lastly, the credit\n            supports health and education reforms, which have as a\n            primary goal ensuring equitable access to essential services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Second
