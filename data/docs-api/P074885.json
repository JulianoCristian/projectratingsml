The project was initiated in late 2001 and\n            approved by the Board on May 6, 2003. The loan and project\n            agreements were signed on October 1, 2003, and became\n            effective on July 26, 2004. Long delays in signing and\n            ratification of the Loan and critical interruptions in the\n            procurement process in late 2004/early 2005 were mostly\n            related to political reasons and not to the loan itself. In\n            the hindsight, these delays led to losing momentum in\n            project implementation. Some of the lessons learned from the\n            project are: 1) support of key high-ranking officials may be\n            enough for project approval but is insufficient for\n            implementation and the sustainability of outcomes,\n            particular in countries with institutional challenges, such\n            as Ukraine; 2) a fully functioning and staffed PIU and\n            remunerated for their services is essential for effective\n            and efficient project implementation. The Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) was not fully staffed and in some\n            cases the salaries of the staff were not paid for over a\n            year, although allocations were made under the Loan for\n            these payments; and 3) the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)\n            states that the first year's procurement documents were\n            ready, but it took almost till March 2005 till the first\n            Terms of Reference (TORs) were prepared and ready for\n            tender. The TORs for the first year's procurement\n            activities should have been prepared and agreed prior to\n            Board approval. In addition, the Bank should have ensured\n            that the agreed procurement methods are the most appropriate\n            for the type of procurement envisaged under the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine -

This line of reforms is actively\n            supported by the World Bank, with its most important\n            projects aimed at building up the private sector in Ukraine.\n            In 1996 and 1998, the enterprise development adjustment\n            loans (EDAL) I and II were implemented in two stages. In\n            2002, the World Bank approved granting a loan to Ukraine for\n            the private sector development project. This project is a\n            systemic (adjustment) type, being oriented not only to the\n            extensive development of private enterprises, but also to\n            increasing the efficiency and profitability of production,\n            and the manufacture of competitive products. The project\n            objective is also to ensure that privatized enterprises\n            themselves, after acquiring know-how and work experience\n            under the conditions of new economic realities, become\n            experts and leaders of enterprise restructuring, supporters,\n            and implementers of market ideas in the regions.\n            Introduction of the latest models of information and\n            communication technologies (ICT) can considerably increase\n            the efficiency and expeditiousness of decisions approval,\n            stimulate the development of the private sector, and\n            strengthen civil society in Ukraine. In order to attain\n            these goals, a credit agreement on financing the project\n            Ukraine: e-development was signed in 2003 between the World\n            Bank and the Ukrainian Government. The activities envisaged\n            by the project have positive prospects for consolidating\n            administrative reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"World Bank projects in private sector

decision-making process\n            for public procureement and documentation flow, foster\n            private sector development, and strengthen civil society\n            through introducing innovative models of Information and\n            Communication Technologies (ICT) solutions. There are three\n            project components. The E-Government component provides for\n            development and introduction of the public E-Procurement and\n            E-Documentation flow models aimed at increasing efficiency\n            and transparency of the Government actions. amendments\n            required to facilitate introduction of the Internet-based\n            transactions in the procurement cycle, and carrying out a\n            pilot testing in one of the Borrower's state agencies\n            with larger volume of the procurement transactions.\n            Fine-tuning of the developed model will be based on the\n            feedbacks and recommendations from public agencies and\n            vendors to assure its replicability. The E-Documentation\n            flow subcomponent will develop the most appropriate model\n            for documentation flow to increase efficiency of the\n            decision-making processes (preparation, appraisal, approval,\n            implementation, supervision and completion phases) of the\n            document flow for issuing and monitoring the resolutions and\n            orders of the Borrower's Cabinet of Ministers, extended\n            pilot testing thereof, and introduction of a workflow\n            information system to allow the secure processing and\n            exchange of e-documents. The second component, the\n            E-Business Environment component, will assess the main\n            bottlenecks in current legislation that hamper e-business\n            growth. Legislative, normative and regulatory environment\n            adequate to accelerate enabling on-line transactions will be\n            developed. It will also provide framework for their\n            introduction and secure a favorable e-business regulatory\n            environment for the other Parts of the Project, thereby\n            complementing them. The third component, the Public-Private\n            E-Dialogue component, will provide for on-line tools for an\n            exchange of ideas between public authorities and\n            representatives of private sector and civil society at the\n            national and regional levels. Introduction of these tools\n            would i) improve public sector transparency, and ii)\n            strengthen the role and involvement of civil society in the\n            governance
