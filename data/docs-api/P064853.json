Lessons indicate that the strong\n            institutional, and political support from the Government\n            contributed to the project's overall success, and, its\n            effective coordination with the Bank, helped sustain\n            momentum. The major success factor was the use of\n            international investment, and privatization advisors to\n            assist with the restructuring, privatization, and\n            liquidation plans of major state-owned enterprises, and\n            banks, since it introduced an element of transparency,\n            professionalism, and objectivity which may not have\n            occurred, had it been left to the State Ownership Fund. In\n            addition, joining social protection with major restructuring\n            efforts, as a priority to mitigate the social costs of\n            enterprise restructuring, is perhaps one of the reasons why\n            social turmoil did not erupt, since the efforts made to\n            provide unemployment and severance payments, appear to have\n            had positive impacts, even in the politically sensitive\n            mining sector. However, the government's administrative\n            capacity was stretched too far, particularly in relation to\n            the multitude of tasks, and components to be achieved in a\n            relatively short period. The appointment of permanent\n            on-site advisors to assist during implementation, would have\n            been beneficial in the preparation of Terms of Reference,\n            procurement issues, and in developing comprehensive data bases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Private Sector Adjustment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Romania - Private Sector\n

- Private Sector Adjustment Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Private Sector Adjustment Loan aims\n            to: 1) accelerate state-owned enterprise (SOE)\n            privatization, enforce hard budget constraints on remaining\n            SOEs, and implement an action plan to stimulate private\n            sector development and streamline the business environment;\n            2) gradually strengthening the banking system, ensure that\n            state banks are restructured, develop further the government\n            securities market; 3) create income support program for\n            displaced workers, improve employment services for displaced\n            workers, strengthen the social assistance programs for the\n            long-term unemployed and poor, and inform the general public\n            about the rationale for the reform. In terms of benefits,\n            this project will enhance Romania's prospect for\n            growth, and sustain its macroeconomic stabilization.\n            Privatization will increase economic efficiency. Stronger\n            governance will reduce losses and arrears in the SOE sector.\n            Financial sector reform will provide the basis for\n            developing a new capital market. The main risks stem from\n            the political difficulty of implementing the ambitious\n            program. However, the government has shown commitment to see\n            through the program. Another risk is the negative impact on\n            poverty because of job losses, weak social safety nets, and\n            low wages. This risk is partly mitigated by the unemployment\n            insurance, severance pay, micro-credit, etc. provided by\n            this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Private Sector
