These two projects increased access to rural\n            water supply and sanitation in India. Some lessons learned\n            included; improving the quality of rural service delivery to\n            increase access to water supply and sanitation improves\n            environmental health. Given a supportive institutional\n            environment, decentralized, community led water supply and\n            sanitation projects can be both effective and less costly at\n            providing new rural infrastructure. Government line agencies\n            that have traditionally delivered services through a\n            centralized, government-led approach face challenges in\n            supporting decentralized, community led rural water supply\n            and sanitation approaches. The limited availability of\n            experienced Non-government Organization (NGOs) capacity to\n            facilitate community capacity building can constrain\n            adoption of the community-led approach for rural water and\n            sanitation service delivery. And there is a role for public\n            or private support agencies to provide much-needed expertise\n            and technical support to trouble-shoot community-owned water\n            schemes. Where this is missing, communities have difficulty\n            in planning and managing major maintenance and budgeting for\n            the schemes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Kerala Rural Water

Some lessons learned included: i) ownership of\n            the project design and continuous support during its\n            implementation at the political, bureaucratic, and\n            operational levels is a prerequisite for project success.\n            Conducive policy environment and willingness to learn by\n            doing are equally vital for success; ii) while piloting new\n            approaches and implementing paradigm shifts - the borrowers\n            must consistently provide sound and continuous leadership\n            and staff in the project management units throughout the\n            project period. The Bank too should have adequate remedies\n            (such as suspension of disbursements) to address the issue\n            of frequent and arbitrary turnover of key project staff\n            which can affect pace and quality of implementation; iii)\n            projects implemented directly by communities can earn cost\n            savings than when done through contractors. In this project,\n            for example, actual costs were approximately 15 percent less\n            than those estimated at appraisal. Greater accuracy can be\n            introduced in cost estimation at appraisal by factoring-in\n            the procurement selection method and implementation\n            procedures; and iv) the small national Technical Assistance\n            (TA) component of the project which aimed at supporting\n            nationwide advocacy of the sector reform policy did not take\n            off due mainly to diminishing of Government of India's\n            (GOI's) interest during implementation.

This will be strengthened by financing staff\n            capacity building, and installation/operation of computers,\n            and office equipment; 2) support community development, and\n            infrastructure building, ensuring mobilization, and\n            women's participation in a broad range of activities.\n            Design, and engineering support will address community\n            managed water supply systems, in addition to construction,\n            drainage, and environmental management. The tribal\n            development program will address water scarcity, and\n            capacity building; 3) provide technical assistance (TA) for\n            comprehensive statewide planning, development and management\n            aspects; and, 4) provide TA to the Central Government, to\n            foster sector reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Kerala Rural Water Supply and\n
