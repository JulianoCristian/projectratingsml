Public transportation in Colombia was\n            traditionally perceived as inefficient, unsafe, and\n            polluting. The streets of Colombian cities were crowded with\n            obsolete buses which operated with disregard for public\n            safety and in near chaos, without organized bus stops. In\n            1996, the government decided to create the Programa Nacional\n            de Transporte Urbano supported by International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financing. The program\n            centered its strategy on the development of Bus Rapid\n            Transit (BRT), which achieves urban mobility at a fraction\n            of the cost of rail systems. The most famous BRT system is\n            Bogot\u00e1\u2019s Transmilenio, conceptualized in 1998. Each day\n            close to 1.4 million passengers, approximately 27 percent of\n            the city\u2019s public transport demand, benefitted from the\n            Transmilenio in Bogot\u00e1. Riders of the two other complete BRT\n            systems, Megabus, Pereira and Mio-Cali, have significantly\n            improved their daily lives, benefiting from an organized,\n            regulated, modern, and reliable public transportation system\n            that utilizes a modern fleet and less polluting fuels. Since\n            its inception, delegations from more than 20 countries have\n            visited Colombia to learn about the program. Similarly,\n            multi-city transport programs were being developed in other\n            countries such as Mexico and Argentina with direct IBRD\n            involvement and there had been a significant collaboration\n            and sharing of knowledge between Colombia and other\n            developing countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Implementing urban transport in Colombia"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Implementing urban transport in Colombia"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/02/25143705/implementing-urban-transport-colombia","count":"Colombia","lang":"Arabic","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"transport, logistics,urban, roads, infrastructure"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Environment and natural resource management,Urban development,Economic management","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Implementaci\u00f3n del transporte urbano en Colombia"}},"topic":"Urban Roads m1326436 785,Urban Development m1327371 699,Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)\n            m1326216 1725,Urban Transport m1327133 788,Transit-Oriented Development m1325988 903,Transport and Urban Development m1327134 1727,Urban Transport Policy and Planning\n            m1327602 1728","projn":"CO-Integrated Mass Transit Systems Second\n            Additional Financing -- P114325,CO-Integrated Mass Transit System -\n            Additional Financing -- P101356,CO-Integrated Mass Transit Systems -- P082466,CO-Bogota Urban Services Project -- P074726,CO-Urban Transport -- P006872","subtopic":"Transport in Urban Areas,Transport and Trade Logistics,Inter-Urban Roads and Passenger Transport,Transport and Environment,Urban Transport,Intelligent Transport Systems,Transport Services","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Transport,Urban Development","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08313c429_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","theme":"Analysis of economic growth,Municipal governance and institution building,Pollution management and environmental health,Climate change,Municipal governance and institution building,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Urban services and housing for the poor,Pollution management and environmental health,Municipal governance and institution building,Participation and civic engagement,Urban services and housing for the poor,Pollution management and environmental health,Land administration and management,Other urban development,Municipal governance and institution building,Urban services and housing for the poor,Environmental policies and institutions","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Transport,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Urban Roads m1326436 785,Urban Development m1327371 699,Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS)\n            m1326216 1725,Urban Transport m1327133 788,Transit-Oriented Development m1325988 903,Transport and Urban Development m1327134 1727,Urban Transport Policy and Planning\n            m1327602 1728","owner":"Transport & ICT - GP (GTIDR)","trustfund":"TF037599-LATIN AMERICA REGION - EL\n            NINIO, PMD II, URB.
