Some lessons learned includes:\n            India's National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) is a useful\n            governance-oriented model for countries modernizing their\n            service delivery processes. The citizen-centered approach of\n            the NeGP is a vibrant and relevant model for countries or\n            sub-national governments which are designing or implementing\n            Information and Communication Technology (ICT) reform\n            programs. An innovative and creative approach is needed for\n            engaging with a sophisticated client like the central\n            Government of India. Low-income state engagement is\n            well-aligned with the Bank's poverty and shared\n            prosperity mission; in the area of e-governance, it is also\n            a strategy which reflects a 'good fit' between\n            client needs and the Bank's traditional products and\n            services. Engagement with the Government is most beneficial\n            when it remains focused on substance and flexibility. A\n            structured and strategic approach to risk management should\n            be considered when programmatic interruption is a\n            significant possibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - E-delivery of Public Services\n            Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - E-delivery of Public\n

implementation of\n            its National e -Governance Plan (NeGP). The ambitious goal\n            of this government-wide initiative is to make all government\n            services accessible to the common man (citizen) in his\n            locality, through common service delivery outlets and ensure\n            efficiency, transparency and reliability of such services at\n            affordable costs to realize basic needs. NeGP was approved\n            in May 2006 as a national program, coordinated at the\n            cabinet level, to replace an ad hoc array of e-governance\n            initiatives across individual agencies and states that had\n            developed throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The program is\n            expected to have significant social benefits for the poor\n            through expanded access, and improved citizen engagement in\n            e-services. GoI recognizes that the uneven progress of NeGP\n            has not been primarily due to funding constraints or the\n            absence of specific investments, but rather to cross-cutting\n            policy and coordination issues at a program level. The\n            development objective of the proposed series of DPLs is\n            'to increase access to online services by citizens in\n            their localities.' thus supporting a major part of the\n            NeGP's overall goal. It will assist the government do\n            this through supporting policy and institutional actions\n            that constitute a higher emphasis on coordination in the\n            NeGP, and increased outreach to citizens."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - E-delivery of Public Services\n            Development Policy Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - E-delivery of
