Some\n            lessons learned includes: approach, scope and timeframe for\n            similar emergency response projects. The project experience\n            has confirmed the viability of combining a public works\n            approach with the more conventional contracted works\n            approach to irrigation and drainage infrastructure\n            rehabilitation. Limiting the scope of emergency\n            interventions to mostly physical system improvements may\n            have been appropriate in the first instance, but an early\n            subsequent evolution to sustainable development\n            interventions that include well focused institutional and\n            agricultural support programs would seem to be called for.\n            Manual labor contract and payment arrangements: the concepts\n            and processes developed and applied for contracting and\n            paying for manual labor works under the project, aimed at\n            ensuring transparency and preventing corruption, were\n            considered to be sound and replicable for future similar\n            projects. Social targeting for public works programs aimed\n            at providing temporary manual labor employment as a means of\n            supplementing income for the poorest, most vulnerable and\n            jobless members of the rural communities, the process of\n            setting and applying criteria for operation of the programs\n            and selection of beneficiaries is a crucial and difficult\n            one. Involvement of women: from the responsible\n            Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), the already achieved\n            level of inclusion of women workers into the project's\n            manual labor force could be further increased in future\n            similar projects by applying a few simple additional\n            incentive measures including (i) assigning men and women to\n            separate work fronts and locations, (ii) allocating women\n            workers to the smaller-scale works with lower lifting and\n            throwing requirements, and (iii) arranging where possible\n            for women to be assigned to work sites that were close to\n            their homes. Supervision, facilitation, coordination and\n            management arrangements: the levels of supervision,\n            facilitation, coordination and management provided by all of\n            the implementation partners to the project was seemingly\n            very high compared to other types of development project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajikistan - Public Employment for\n

The requested grant will\n            finance a public works program to provide temporary\n            employment to food insecure rural people, by rehabilitating\n            the farm level irrigation and drainage network in selected\n            high food insecurity districts. It thus responds to a\n            significant drop in remittance income due to the global\n            financial crisis, which has severely compromised current\n            household food security, and to the medium-term constraint\n            to domestic food production caused by inadequate drainage\n            and irrigation.
