The major lessons learned is that\n            up-front commitments and support for sector reform, with\n            articulated ownership by all parties concerned, facilitates\n            the process of commercialization and power sector\n            restructuring. The second lesson learned is that importance\n            of embracing difficult sector policy issues within the\n            overall macro dialogue through structural adjustment\n            operations. This brought into sharp focus the potential\n            impact of the YTL transaction on the economy and power\n            sector, and prompted support for actions to redress tariff\n            levels. This also led to the adoption of a much more\n            transparent environment for private sector participation in\n            the power sector. The third lesson learned is the need to be\n            very specific concerning whether or not to include optional\n            items in bid evaluations. Fourthly, the absence of a\n            Standard Bidding Document for Supply and Installation of\n            Plant and Equipment, which was introduced about mid-term of\n            project, is partly the cause for some of the procurement\n            delays encountered by the Project. Fifthly, Zimbabwe\n            Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has set the example that\n            a monthly application of an automatic adjustment formula\n            helps to underpin its financial viability, at the same time\n            minimizing political interference. Additional measures will\n            be needed to enable ZESA repay its large accumulated foreign\n            debt brought about by exchange rate and inflation changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe -
