Overall sustainability of the policy reforms is,\n            therefore, rated likely. Both World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are assessed as satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            include the following: Set limited objectives-it is more\n            realistic to support a program of reforms with a number of\n            sequential operations that can be approved based on the\n            success of the previous ones. Banking restructuring\n            operations should disburse against the completed resolution\n            of specific banks' cases, not against the promise of\n            future actions which may not materialize. Ensure that the\n            main implementing agency is the main recipient of the Bank\n            resources. Bank support should come only after a political\n            consensus in favor of restructuring banks and facing past\n            losses has been achieved. Tools of evaluation may need to be\n            better adapted to suit sequential operations within a\n            broader program. Prior attempts to \"contain\" the\n            banking crisis were excessively focused on \"accounting\n            solutions\" (i.e., exchange of bad loans for government\n            paper) with no cash flow impact. The \"least cash\n            solution\" was not the \"least cost solution\"\n            and several banks, full of government paper, had to be\n            interervened since their cash flow continued to deteriorate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
