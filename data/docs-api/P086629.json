Some\n            lessons learned included: the project was focused on a\n            single sub-sector. The basis for this focus was a careful\n            analysis of the sector, potential market growth and the\n            physical conditions in the province. The selection of the\n            dairy sector for support was therefore done properly and\n            this was demonstrated in the project to be an appropriate\n            choice. Many farmers have benefitted from the project.\n            However, a single sector focus also comes with risks and is\n            susceptible to supply and demand shocks which can have a\n            major impact on project implementation. This vulnerability\n            needs to be recognized and explicitly addressed during\n            preparation and appraisal. Although the specific external\n            shocks could not always have been predicted, the risks are\n            apparent, especially for livestock related sectors. All\n            intensive livestock sectors must pay close attention to\n            livestock waste management issues as these are elements for\n            the success and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n            Under this project, although provisions were in place to\n            ensure that appropriate waste management facilities were\n            included in the infrastructure development, there was an\n            over-reliance on the environmental protection bureau to\n            monitor and enforce compliance. Future International Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) projects might\n            consider to including the financing of waste management\n            (which has a public good justification). Monitoring and\n            evaluation received too little attention from the project\n            implementation agency, which may have not recognized the\n            importance of this and therefore were unwilling to devote\n            sufficient time and resources. Some indicators could have\n            been better designed to make them easier to measure. If\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems under perform\n            during project implementation, Bank teams need to facilitate\n            the execution of evaluative studies at the Mid Term Review\n            (MTR) and after project completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Heilongjiang Dairy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Heilongjiang Dairy

The first objective is\n            to improve the financial viability of existing and new dairy\n            operations (about 10,000 HH) in selected areas of\n            Heilongjiang province. The second objective is to\n            demonstrate innovative technologies to reduce greenhouse gas\n            (GHG) emissions and increase carbon sequestration. The\n            ministry of finance and Heilongjiang province have the\n            following changes to the project: i) extension of the\n            closing dates of the International Bank for Reconstruction\n            and Development (IBRD) Loan and Italian grant by twelve\n            months, from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2011; ii)\n            reduction in the scope of activities and the cancellation of\n            USD30 million from the IBRD Loan; iii) reallocation of funds\n            under the Italian grant; and iv) the revision of indicators\n            and targets in the monitoring table to reflect these\n            changes. The changes are justified by the numerous delays,\n            mostly from external factors beyond the control of the\n            project, which have hampered project implementation, and\n            also changes in the dairy sector which have reduced the\n            demand for the project activities, notably the reluctance of\n            small-scale farmers to invest in dairy cattle."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China -
