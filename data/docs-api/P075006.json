Some lessons learned included:\n            reform of land administration is a long-term endeavor that\n            requires decades of investment of capital and human\n            resources and sustained commitment. However, the path\n            towards reform of land reform is rarely straight-forward,\n            and commitment on the part of authorities is often neither\n            sustained nor consistent. Thus, a support strategy should\n            balance a clear sense of direction and priorities with a\n            significant dose of pragmatism. This project could have\n            benefited from a more stable policy framework and closer\n            engagement between the donors and the government. It is\n            important that reform is demand driven, i.e. by the\n            government, rather than supply driven, i.e. by the donors.\n            There is a risk when measurement of project impact depends\n            on a self-standing study to be completed toward the end of\n            the life of the project. In the case of LTP II, relying too\n            heavily on a self-standing impact assessment unrelated to\n            the ongoing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system\n            resulted in the

The\n            project would contribute to the government's National\n            Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP) under preparation. The\n            objectives o f the project are to (i) improve  the security\n            o f land tenure; (ii) develop transparent and efficient land\n            administration institutions at the  national and provincial\n            levels; and (iii) improve the government's capacity to\n            provide social and  economic services through broader\n            revenue base from property related fees and taxes. These\n            objectives  would be achieved through formulating and\n            approving land policy and regulatory changes, strengthening\n            institutional capacity and project management, accelerating\n            land titling activities in areas o f high  demand,\n            developing and implementing an efficient and transparent\n            land registration system, and  strengthening land valuation\n            systems. There are 5 project components. Component 1\n            provides support to develop the land policy and regulatory\n            framework, and specifically helps to develop the\n            government's capacity to formulate land policies and\n            establishes a coordination mechanism for land information.\n            Component 2 supports long-term development of the Department\n            of Lands and the Provincial Land Office; provides training\n            and human resources development; and supports education in\n            the areas of land administration, land management, and\n            property valuation. Component 3 develops a modern land\n            registration system by helping land offices operate\n            according to agreed standards, providing community education\n            and services, strengthening land valuation to support land\n            registration, and supporting the Department of State Assets\n            Management. Component 4 accelerates land registration\n            through systematic registration. Component 5 supports\n            project management and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Laos - Second Land Titling Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Laos - Second Land Titling Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2376053/laos-second-land-titling-project","projn":"LA-Second Land Titling  Project -- P075006","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Rural Land Policies for Poverty Reduction,Environmental Economics & Policies,Land Use and Policies,Urban Housing,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Lao People's Democratic Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20030611085959"},"subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,General public administration sector","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ADB,agricultural areas,agricultural\n            land,Agriculture,apartment,apartment blocks,Arable\n            land,banking sector,communal land,Community\n            Relations,Construction,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,economic development,economic growth,economic\n            impact,electric power,employment,financial resources,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Forest land,Forestry,improved land,income,information\n            dissemination,interest rates,investment\n            expenditures,irrigated land,Key performance indicators,labor\n            force,land administration,land claims,land development,land\n            improvement,land leasing,Land management,land market,land\n            markets,land parcels,Land Planning,land reform,land\n            registration,land rights,land sales,land speculation,land\n            tenure,land title,land titles,Land Titling,land\n            transactions,land use,land use planning,land\n            valuation,LandUse Planning,Laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,local government,macroeconomic\n            stability,Mortgage lending,natural resources,poverty\n            alleviation,poverty line,Present\n            Value,privatization,productivity,property values,regulatory\n            framework,resource mobilization,resources management,rural\n            areas,rural development,state property,sustainable use,tax\n            revenue,Technical Assistance,towns,trade flows,urban\n            areas,Urban population,villages,zoning"},"1":{"cdata!":"ADB,agricultural areas,agricultural\n            land,Agriculture,apartment,apartment blocks,Arable\n            land,banking sector,communal land,Community\n            Relations,Construction,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,economic development,economic growth,economic\n            impact,electric power,employment,financial resources,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Forest land,Forestry,improved land,income,information\n            dissemination,interest rates,investment\n            expenditures,irrigated land,Key performance indicators,labor\n            force,land administration,land claims,land development,land\n            improvement,land leasing,Land management,land market,land\n            markets,land parcels,Land Planning,land reform,land\n            registration,land rights,land sales,land speculation,land\n            tenure,land title,land titles,Land Titling,land\n            transactions,land use,land use planning,land\n            valuation,LandUse Planning,Laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,local government,macroeconomic\n            stability,Mortgage lending,natural resources,poverty\n            alleviation,poverty line,Present\n            Value,privatization,productivity,property values,regulatory\n            framework,resource mobilization,resources management,rural\n            areas,rural development,state property,sustainable use,tax\n            revenue,Technical Assistance,towns,trade flows,urban\n            areas,Urban population,villages,zoning"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF030356-AUSTRALIA CTF FY03 -

Nonetheless, setting\n            land titling (LT) boundaries may potentially come in\n            conflict with road widening, or construction lines, where a\n            variety of public services could be held up, made more\n            expensive, or abandoned altogether, causing serious public\n            health consequences.
