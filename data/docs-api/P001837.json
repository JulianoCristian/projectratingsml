Bank's performance was satisfactory.\n            Borrower's performance was satisfactory. The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i) the government's\n            capacity to implement the operation should be honestly\n            evaluated and assistance to strengthen this capacity should\n            be included in the project if necessary; (ii) more\n            supervision resources need to be allocated than would\n            normally be the case for either investment or adjustment\n            operations; (iii) government's withdrawal from the\n            traditional functions of management and control should be\n            done gradually, and adequate support should be provided to\n            help ease the transition; (iv) the hybrid character of the\n            operation, where investments supported reform actions,\n            proved to be effective and made the reform program more\n            meaningful to those responsible for its implementation; and\n            (v) under the given circumstances in Mauritania, irrigated\n            rice production for the domestic market is not economically\n            viable unless it is associated with other irrigated crops\n            and unless this production system is integrated with the\n            rest of the agricultural sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Agricultural Sector Adjustment\n            and Investment
