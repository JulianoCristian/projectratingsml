Some lessons learned included:\n            participatory approaches create expectations that can be\n            difficult to meet. To the extent that projects based on\n            participatory community-driven development (CDD) approaches\n            succeed in mobilizing rural communities to articulate their\n            development needs, they have a tendency to generate\n            expectations that may be difficult to meet if significant\n            amounts of financing cannot be mobilized. Capacity of local\n            communities to contribute co-financing may be limited. The\n            project design called for beneficiaries to contribute Ten\n            percent of subproject costs, but beneficiaries were able to\n            contribute only Three percent on average, and a significant\n            part of their contributions was in kind. Capacity building\n            is a long term process. A consistent message heard from many\n            stakeholders was the importance of continuing the capacity\n            building activities that were launched during the first\n            phase of the project. Results frameworks and Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) plans must be realistic given capacity\n            constraints. The results framework and the associated\n            M&E plan for the project turned out to be extremely\n            ambitious given the limited capacity available for their\n            implementation. The project M&E manual called for the\n            collection of far too much information, excessively frequent\n            reporting, and the use of overly sophisticated analytical procedures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad - Local Development Program Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chad - Local Development Program\n            Support

To this end, the\n            project components will: 1) provide matching grants to\n            cofinance subprojects proposed by community-based\n            organizations, or decentralized local government entities.\n            This component will finance: a) activities in transport\n            (bridges), education (classrooms), health (health posts,\n            HIV/AIDS prevention and information, personnel training),\n            and water and sanitation (wells); b) management of natural\n            resources activities such as erosion control, tree\n            nurseries, forests management, and alternatives to fuelwood;\n            c) large-scale and more expensive collective infrastructure\n            projects that would affect several villages, or cantons,\n            such as drilling, rural roads, and water supply systems; 2)\n            support capacity building for local development\n            stakeholders, to strengthen the technical and organizational\n            capacity at the community level, for participatory\n            approaches, needs assessments, project management, access to\n            credit, or new poverty reduction behaviors. Given the\n            multisectoral nature of the program, these capacity-building\n            activities shall entail a wide spectrum of sectors including\n            health, environment, education, transport, and energy. This\n            component would be implemented in local languages, and would\n            prioritize the learning-by-doing approach as opposed to the\n            lecture approach. 3) support the implementation of the\n            decentralization policy, through three subcomponents:\n            support to the completion of the legal and regulatory\n            framework of the decentralization process; strengthening of\n            the institutional and technical capacities of key\n            stakeholders of the decentralization process at the\n            national, regional, and local levels; and, support to the\n            land tenure system definition; and, 4) provide project\n            management support to coordinate, and manage project\n            activities, and, ensure the availability of funds.\n            Accounting activities, monitoring and evaluation, and\n            administrative functions will be strongly

Mitigation measures are as\n            follows: concerning transport, and roads construction,\n            community participation will be included in the route\n            tracing process, further validated by drainage studies,\n            while local workers, as well as local materials for\n            construction will be utilized; deforestation should be\n            minimized, and fragmentation of natural habitats avoided,\n            emphasizing on vegetation propagation following\n            construction; similarly, regarding energy subprojects,\n            installation of power distribution lines should minimize\n            deforestation and natural habitats fragmentation, and\n            voltage should be determined in accordance to socioeconomic\n            parameters; schools, and health facilities should be\n            constructed close to villages, avoiding flood prone areas,\n            and ensuring appropriate wastes disposal procedures; water\n            quality testing and adequate drainage systems should be\n            observed in the implementation of water supply subprojects.\n            Recommendations on involuntary resettlement issues are also included."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tchad - Projet du Programme de Developpement\n            Local : evaluation environnementale"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tchad - Projet du Programme de\n            d\u00e9veloppement local : \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/09/2072634/tchad-projet-du-programme-de-developpement-local-evaluation-environnementale","projn":"TD-Local Development Program Support Project\n            -- P066998","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Chad","authors":{"authr":"Yoradi, Nadjilom"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02120304011074"},"subsc":"Other social services,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Community\n            participation; Decentralization; Local ownership; Local\n            communities; Infrastructure development; Legal &\n            regulatory framework; Environmental management;\n            Institutional capacity; Socioeconomic conditions; Project\n            design; Project implementation; Natural habitats; Local\n            knowledge; Subprojects; Training assistance; Roads\n            environmental aspects; Community participation; Drainage\n            systems; Forest conservation; Vegetative propagation; Power\n            distribution; School construction; Health care facilities;\n            Flood plain zoning; Water supply & sanitation; Water\n            quality; Drainage systems; Natural resource management;\n            Involuntary resettlement"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 2 (AFTS2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF041074-CHAD - RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,TF041012-CHAD - APPRAISAL OF LOCAL\n            DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,TF040195-CHAD - PREPARATION OF LOCAL\n            GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,TF038852-CHAD - APPRAISAL OF RURAL\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS,TF038846-CHAD - LOCAL GOVERNMENT\n            DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,TF050143-NTF-ESSD:SOCIAL WINDOW-CDD CHAD,TF038951-CHAD - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT\n            PROJECT - APPRAISAL, PREPARATION,TF038889-CHAD - SECTOR WORK - FORESTS\n            & ENVIRONMENT,TF026709-PHRD-CHAD: LOCAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF040294-ETHIOPIA - FOOD SECURITY\n            PROGRAM - SUPPORT TO AFTR2 CAP OPERATIONS,TF039760-CENTRAL AFRICA-REGIONAL\n            ENVIRON.INFORMATION MAGMNT.
