The major lessons of general applicability\n            from the five loans assessed include: Continuity of Bank\n            interventions is important for promoting lasting\n            institutional change. Sub-national programmatic loans offer\n            advantages, in this respect, over time-bound State Reform\n            Loan (SRLs). The principles of the Levy Report remain\n            relevant for designing financial sector lending operations.\n            Credit lines (financial intermediary loans) are unlikely to\n            be appropriate instruments for supporting financial sector\n            adjustment. Reconciling project expenditures fully and\n            correctly at closing is a core Bank responsibility. An\n            oversight agency operating within an appropriate regulatory\n            framework is an important prerequisite to successful\n            privatization of public services. As investment loans, the\n            SRLs proved to be cumbersome instruments for supporting\n            structural change."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Public Sector Management, Private\n
