Some lessons\n            learned included: the Bank strategy of taking a firm but\n            reasoned stand on all of the loan conditions played a key\n            role in bringing the program to a satisfactory conclusion.\n            In particular, this consistency of position was crucial to\n            bringing the program back on track at various points. More\n            detailed attention needs to be focused on achieving and\n            maintaining sustainable consensus for the reform program.\n            From the beginning, support for the program was mixed and\n            fragile because inadequate attention was given by Government\n            to disseminating public information on the need for economic\n            reform and on the objectives of the program. To ensure\n            effective implementation of the reforms and their\n            sustainability, solid and long term political commitment is\n            needed. To this end, support for the reform program should\n            be built by involving all elements of society including the\n            bureaucracy, the polity and stakeholders in civil

To address the\n            pressing stabilization and development issues facing Papua\n            New Guinea, the ERP loan is designed to address only key\n            macroeconomic and structural issues whose implementation is\n            expected to stabilize the economy, begin the process of\n            sustainable private-sector-led growth, while improving the\n            delivery of public services and strengthen natural resource\n            management, particularly forestry. It will assist the\n            Government to build support among various stakeholders for\n            the program by allocating higher share of public resources\n            to essential public services through various distribution\n            and service delivery systems, including non-governmental\n            organizations (NGOs) and churches.
