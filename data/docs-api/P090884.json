The EAGGF are\n            grant funds and are therefore \"free.\" At the time\n            of Loan Approval, guidelines from the EU on the use of these\n            funds after 2006 were not clear. The new Government decided\n            to substitute Bank loan funds with the grant funds that\n            became available. It should be noted that the Project\n            Objective remains valid; preparation for the Leader Axis\n            remains critical for utilization of the next phase of EU\n            funding (from 2007-2013) and the Government expects to\n            implement the key activities planned under the Project.\n            Although there were no disbursements under the loan at the\n            time of loan cancellation, a number of Project activities\n            had been completed and financed by the Government through\n            the Slovak budget.

Preparation\n            Technical Assistance (TA) Project is to assist the Ministry\n            of Agriculture of the Slovak Republic, and its subordinate\n            organizations, as well as local governments, communities and\n            civil society organizations, in developing their capacity to\n            prepare for, and implement the European Union (EU) Leader\n            axis for the period 2007-2013. The project will finance\n            primarily technical assistance and training, including\n            stakeholder workshops, consultations, etc., a limited number\n            of small goods, and operating costs. The project components\n            are: 1) creation of policy and administrative framework, to\n            create the framework for policy-making processes, and\n            administrative decision-making within the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MOA), and between the MOA and its associated\n            national, and local level institutions, municipalities (and\n            other local governmental structures), and communities,\n            through the provision of technical assistance; 2) mapping\n            component, whose main goal is to create a specialized map of\n            the rural areas in the Slovak Republic, with specific\n            delineation of possible micro-regions which could be\n            eligible for inclusion in the Leader Axis, according to the\n            EU relevant criteria. The mapping will also help\n            municipalities in defining the opportunities for cooperation\n            among themselves; 3) formation and training of local action\n            groups, and implementation of pilot projects, entails the\n            formation of a \"Local Action Group\" (LAG) as the\n            administrative unit, responsible for implementing Leader\n            projects. According to EU regulations, a LAG should\n            represent no more than 100,000 and not less than 10,000\n            persons. The LAG's responsibilities include project\n            screening and approval, monitoring (both physical and\n            impact), payments, etc. This component will finance TA to be\n            provided to selected groups, in order to become fully\n            functioning LAGs; and, 4) creation of national rural\n            network, to serve as the Leader Contact Point, and rural\n            information and data collection center for the country,\n            tasked with supporting a broad range of rural development\n            activities throughout the country. Technical assistance will\n            be provided to MOA to undertake a broader assessment of all\n            rural actors, necessary to make the Network functional, and\n            able to manage its operations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovak Republic -
