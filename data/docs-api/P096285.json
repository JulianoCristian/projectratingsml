Some lessons learned\n            includes: from the perspective of the Participating\n            Financial Institution's (PFIs), it was important to\n            learn first and then adopt later with good understanding. A\n            number of interviewed institutions mentioned that they had\n            adopted an attitude of learning from consultants, but did\n            not make rapid changes to the technologies transferred by\n            the consultants before fully comprehending their\n            implications. The selection should be based mainly on the\n            understanding and commitment from top management on Micro\n            and Small Enterprise (MSE) lending and overall management of\n            the bank, rather than focusing solely on the current\n            performance of a bank. External factors could play an\n            important role in a MSE project. The strong performance of\n            the country's economy, while exerting a positive\n            effect, resulted in funding availability among the PFIs,\n            which did not have the incentive to borrow from sub-loan\n            with high funding costs of the China Development Bank (CDB)\n            that hindered its ability to on-lend to these PFIs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
