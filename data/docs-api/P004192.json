Some\n            lessons learned included: despite infrequent Bank\n            supervision missions, the beneficiaries substantially\n            exceeded the project's physical targets and implemented\n            institutional reforms well beyond the project's\n            original scope. Specifically, changing the specifications\n            for the long-distance transmission system from fiber-optic\n            to microwave increased long-distance capacity by 15 times at\n            a lower cost, with acceptable quality. Flexibility in\n            specifications permitted the beneficiary to capitalize on\n            technological advances that enabled it to greatly exceed the\n            project's original physical targets. Given the\n            Government's interest in commercializing the economy,\n            and the telecommunications sector in particular, the Bank\n            could have provided more support in sector reform, notably\n            by supervising the project more regularly and encouraging\n            the Government to adopt a more competitive market structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Laos -
