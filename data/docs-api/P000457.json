The immediate objectives of the project were\n            to: (a) reduce CAR's dependence on costly oil imports;\n            (b) make the power sector financially sound; and (c)\n            strengthen Energie Centrafricaine (ENERCA)'s\n            management, through more autonomy, and improvements in staff\n            and planning capacity; its longer-term objectives were to:\n            (d) rationalize the energy sector's overall pricing\n            policy; (e) improve the efficiency of petroleum procurement\n            and distribution; and (f) establish an appropriate\n            environment for promoting private investment in petroleum\n            exploration. The impact of this project was unsatisfactory\n            as none of its objectives were achieved, except for the\n            reduction of CAR's dependence on costly oil imports and\n            the improvements in the efficiency of distribution of\n            petroleum products, which was partially achieved. The\n            overall Bank performance was marginally satisfactory. The\n            Borrower's performance was also unsatisfactory. Key\n            lessons learned include: (i) for an investment operation\n            with a significant policy component and institutional\n            development objectives to be successful, a clear sector\n            development strategy setting out the necessary reform agenda\n            is a prerequisite; (ii) given the local institution and\n            capacity building weaknesses, an in-depth analysis of\n            participating institutions and staff has to be carried out\n            as part of project preparation and the implementation\n            schedule needs to be established on the basis of this\n            assessment; in the case of the Energy Project, the\n            development objectives proved to be too ambitious in light\n            of the Borrower's and ENERCA's wavering commitment\n            to a sound reform agenda; and (iii) at the preparation stage\n            for a given project, the Bank and the Borrower should ensure\n            that investment decisions by the latter are supported by\n            detailed and systematic studies, with reliable cost\n            estimates and a sound technical justification of the options."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic -
