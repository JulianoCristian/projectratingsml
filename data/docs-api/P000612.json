The project consists of\n            the following components: (a) scaling studies for the\n            correct design of equipment; (b) a Nomad Settlement Impact\n            Study for potential settlement issues; (c) geothermal\n            drilling in the Lake Assal area; and (d) complementary\n            surface exploration works in the Lake Assal area. It also\n            includes: (e) the installation of power plants, and a well\n            head unit and desalination plant; (f) installation of an\n            electrical transmission line; and (g) technical assistance\n            to Electricite de Djibouti (EdD)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti - Geothermal Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Djibouti - Geothermal Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/06/738535/djibouti-geothermal-development-project","projn":"DJ-Geothermal II -- P000612","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Economic Theory & Research,Engineering,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Djibouti","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960927211049"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,air conditioning,Asset\n            Valuation,balance of payments,charcoal,commercial\n            energy,consumers,covers,debt,demand for electricity,demand\n            growth,Developed Countries,development strategy,diesel\n            fuel,Domestic Energy,Drilling,economic activity,Economic\n            Analysis,economic growth,Economic Rate of Return,economic\n            situation,electrical resistivity,Electricity,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity demand,electricity\n            generation,electricity production,Electricity\n            Supply,employment,end use,energy balance,energy\n            conservation,energy conservation measures,energy\n            consumption,energy production,Energy Resources,energy\n            supply,engineering,engineering\n            services,engines,expenditures,Exploitation,exports,fishing,floods,fluids,forecasts,free\n            trade,Fuel,fuel oil,Fuel Price,fuels,gas,GDP,Geothermal\n            Energy,Government expenditures,high oil prices,hydrocarbons,imports,income,Insurance,lighting,logging,"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,air conditioning,Asset\n            Valuation,balance of payments,charcoal,commercial\n            energy,consumers,covers,debt,demand for electricity,demand\n            growth,Developed Countries,development strategy,diesel\n            fuel,Domestic Energy,Drilling,economic activity,Economic\n            Analysis,economic growth,Economic Rate of Return,economic\n            situation,electrical resistivity,Electricity,Electricity\n            Consumption,electricity demand,electricity\n            generation,electricity production,Electricity\n            Supply,employment,end use,energy balance,energy\n            conservation,energy conservation measures,energy\n            consumption,energy production,Energy Resources,energy\n            supply,engineering,engineering\n            services,engines,expenditures,Exploitation,exports,fishing,floods,fluids,forecasts,free\n            trade,Fuel,fuel oil,Fuel Price,fuels,gas,GDP,Geothermal\n            Energy,Government expenditures,high oil prices,hydrocarbons,imports,income,Insurance,lighting,logging,"}},"owner":"Anchor: MG/MU/KM/SC (AFCMG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"7762"},"facets":{}}}
