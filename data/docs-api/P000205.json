The main objectives of the project were: (i) in the\n            short term, to strengthen the economies of secondary towns\n            and, through urban-rural linkages, the economy of their\n            hinterland; and (ii) in the long term, to assist the\n            Borrower's urban growth by improving living conditions\n            of the urban populations in the municipality of Bujumbura,\n            and the communes of Gitega, Ngozi, Kayanza, Rumonge and\n            Bururi. The project merits a rating of Satisfactory as do\n            the Bank's and the Borrower's performances. The\n            project's physical objectives were substantially\n            achieved. Private sector development objectives were\n            partially reached. Sector policy, institutional development\n            and public sector management objectives, were partially\n            attained. The following lessons can be learned from the\n            Second Urban Development Project: (a) No matter how well\n            prepared and implemented a project is, its development\n            impact may be jeopardized in a situation of continued\n            political instability and civil disturbance. (b) To\n            facilitate implementation and supervision, it is advisable\n            to avoid overly ambitious and complex urban development\n            projects with a mix of components and unrelated activities.\n            (c) In an under-urbanized country like Burundi, urban policy\n            and urban development projects must focus particularly on\n            administrative and fiscal institution building. (d) To\n            achieve a sustained urban development, institutional\n            building and Government strong commitment to this task are\n            crucial and needed at early stages of project\n            implementation. (e) Responsibilities of all parties must be\n            well defined and clearly understood before project\n            implementation to avoid a situation in which project units\n            have to carry out inappropriate tasks as a last resort."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
