Following are some of\n            the lessons learned: The economic returns from such\n            replication in BiH could be considerable, multiplying the\n            economic returns to date by several times. Trade\n            facilitation is always a multi-sectoral and multi-agency\n            activity. Customs control is expected to become more\n            effective and efficient under streamlined procedures, based\n            on selectivity and risk analysis. Further cooperation and\n            commitment from government agencies, especially in the area\n            of updating data in website are essential to make the\n            regional website sustainable and successful. It is important\n            to continue the modernization of procedures at all border\n            stations using as much as possible the rules and\n            recommendations of the revised Convention on the\n            simplification and harmonization of Customs procedures.\n            While constructing border crossing facilities, innovative\n            designs that allow future conversion into logistic centers,\n            warehouses, etc, must be encouraged. The long lines of\n            vehicles waiting to be processed at border crossing points\n            are symptomatic of the need for trade facilitation. Building\n            a tradition of inter-agency communication and information\n            sharing as well as building the mechanisms on which such\n            communication can be based, needs a high-level government\n            commitment and ideally a champion. Cumbersome visa\n            procedures and requirements for professional drivers are\n            slowing down especially road freight transport."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Trade\n            and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/03/6691722/bosnia-herzegovina-trade-transport-facilitation-southeast-europe-project","projn":"BA-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            South East Europe Project-458 -- P070079","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Trade Law,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Customs and Trade,Transport and Trade Logistics,Common Carriers Industry","teratopic":"International Economics and Trade,Law and Development,Transport,Industry","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060329091752"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"International Economics and Trade,Law and Development,Transport,Industry","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Border Crossing, border crossings, border\n            infrastructure, Border Management, bribery, Business,\n            clearance terminals, community, Customs, Customs\n            Administration, customs administrations, Customs\n            Directorate, Customs duties, Customs environment, Customs\n            Facilities, Customs fraud, Customs Information, Customs\n            Modernization, Customs offices, Customs procedure, customs\n            procedures, Customs reform, customs services, Customs value,\n            dialogue between Customs, European Union, Exchange Rate,\n            foreign investors, Forwarding, free trade, free trade\n            agreements, freight, Freight Forwarders, freight forwarding,\n            goods classification, inspection, international freight\n            transport, international road haulage, international trade,\n            international transport, Law Enforcement, logistics,\n            national transport, passenger transport, Police, present\n            value, price of fuel, Quality Assurance, Regional\n            integration, road, road pricing, road tolls, road transport,\n            road transport services, Roads, Route, routes, Tax, tires,\n            trade, Trade Facilitation, trade integration, traffic,\n            traffic data, Transit, transparency, TRANSPORT, transport\n            costs, TRANSPORT FACILITATION, transport market, transport\n            operators, transport policies, transport sector,\n            transportation, transportation costs, trip, truck traffic,\n            Trucks, Urbanism, waiting time"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF030454-AUSTRIA GENERAL CTF FY04 - ECA,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.

Its main objectives are to reduce\n            non-tariff costs to trade and transport, and, to reduce\n            smuggling, and corruption at border crossings. The\n            components include: 1) construction of buildings, and\n            canopies at the Raca border crossing, and an inland truck\n            terminal (Novi Grad). Additionally, weighing scales, and\n            laboratory equipment will be supplied, including the\n            corresponding training. Technical services should monitor\n            the performance of the country's Customs\n            Administration, while training to enhance inter-agency\n            awareness will be provided; 2) construction of border\n            stations at Izacic, and Orasje, reconstruction of inland\n            terminals, and information technology infrastructure.\n            Technical services will monitor the performance of the\n            Federation Customs Administration, while training should\n            enhance inter-agency cooperation; 3) conventional, and\n            distance learning training in logistics, and, international\n            freight transport, in cooperation with international\n            professional associations. Public-private partnerships will\n            be enhanced using a virtual forum, to facilitate trade\n            development; and, 4) regional, and national services,\n            supported by advisors in procurement, accounting, and\n            external auditing, including the establishment of a\n            financial management system, and training for project\n            management, and implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

To prevent, minimize, or mitigate site\n            specific negative impacts, however, this environmental\n            management plan (EMP) and a set of mitigation measures have\n            been prepared. The major concerns about possible negative\n            site specific impacts associated with border crossings\n            relate to 1) emissions from vehicles waiting for custom\n            clearances; 2) drainage of disinfectants and spills of oils\n            and fuel; 3) waste disposal and loose garbage; and 4) site\n            disruptions caused by upgrades or relocations of utilities\n            or such infrastructure as buildings, parking/waiting areas,\n            and access roads. Specific actions to minimize any\n            potentially negative impact and promote institutional\n            development include liaising with environmental authorities\n            and reviewing and monitoring EMP compliance; staff training\n            and sensitization at each border crossing; certifying\n            acceptable practices and impact minimization, especially\n            storing and properly using disinfecting materials and\n            chemicals, and hazardous materials and garbage; harmonizing\n            regulatory requirements with European Union and\n            international standards; and incorporating environmental\n            plans in consultant contracts and project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe : environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Trade\n            and Transport Facilitation in Southeast Europe :\n            environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/10/438122/bosnia-herzegovina-trade-transport-facilitation-southeast-europe-environmental-management-plan","projn":"BA-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            South East Europe Project-458 -- P070079","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Sanitation and Sewerage,Airports and Air Services,Environmental Governance,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00031505333329"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access roads,access to\n            information,back-up,Certification,Construction,disinfectants,drainage,emissions,Endangered\n            Species,environmental agencies,environmental\n            assessments,Environmental Authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental officer,environmental\n            regulations,fuel,garbage,hazardous materials,Hazardous\n            Wastes,international standards,International\n            trade,mitigation measures,noise,potential\n            threat,traffic,waste,waste disposal"},"1":{"cdata!":"access roads,access to\n            information,back-up,Certification,Construction,disinfectants,drainage,emissions,Endangered\n            Species,environmental agencies,environmental\n            assessments,Environmental Authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,Environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental officer,environmental\n            regulations,fuel,garbage,hazardous materials,Hazardous\n            Wastes,international standards,International\n            trade,mitigation measures,noise,potential\n            threat,traffic,waste,waste disposal"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF038544-ALBANIA:  TRADE &\n            TRANSPORTATION FACILITATION,TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF040163-ALBANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - PROCURM,TF040162-ABLANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SE EUROPE - PROJECT LAUNCH,TF039898-ROMANIA-TRANSPORT AND TRADE\n            FACILITIES IN SE EUROPE,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.
