The project components are\n            as follows: a) Service delivery provides program support for\n            provincial local government units (LGUs), which includes an\n            expanded program of immunization package, an integrated\n            management of child illness package, a micronutrient\n            malnutrition prevention and control package, a parent\n            effectiveness service package, and a Grade 1 Early Child\n            Experience(ECE)/ECD package. This component will also\n            finance facilities for municipal/city LGUs who wish to\n            invest in upgrading of their ECD services. b) Support to\n            service delivery will support the LGUs in implementing their\n            investment packages in the areas of communications,\n            planning, targeting, management information system,\n            training, human resource development, and institutional\n            development. c) Research and development (R&D) will\n            finance R&D activities needed to support effective ECD\n            program implementation, including initial piloting of new\n            field-level technical interventions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines - Early Childhood Development
