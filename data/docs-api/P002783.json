However, as a result of the project, there\n            is today a more organized sector program. This project has\n            been the largest in the sector and has shown some key\n            lessons for future project design and implementation. 1)\n            Project composition and implementation schedule should match\n            the absorptive capacity of the implementing agency. In\n            design of such large investment involving several donors,\n            the approach should aim at a phased investment with better\n            defined triggers and long-term donors support. 2) In civil\n            works, the absence of detailed engineering for all major\n            roads prior to construction lead to delays and cost\n            increases. 3) The potential for corrupt practices can\n            significantly impact project implementation performance. 4)\n            The lessons of experience of past project implementation\n            were to safeguard against future mistakes both for the Bank\n            and the borrower. 5) Supervision team should have\n            professional mix with key persons being sufficiently\n            experienced in the major fields of project activities.\n            Technical documentation necessary for implementation of\n            civil works should be updated before actual commencement of\n            construction works. 6) In large investment supported by\n            several donors, a professional coordination managed by the\n            government should be established. 7) The government should\n            carry out performance technical and financial audits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Integrated Roads Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Integrated Roads Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/04/728866/tanzania-integrated-roads-project","projn":"TZ-Roads I -- P002783","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Urban Transport,Roads & Highways,Business in Development,Business Environment","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Tanzania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0006020538274"},"subsc":"Aviation,Central government administration,Roads and highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounts,air transport,Audit\n            reports,bridge,bridges,construction,contractors,decentralization,EXPENDITURE,Financial\n            Audits,gravel,gravel roads,highway\n            projects,Highways,National Roads,periodic\n            maintenance,procurement,Quality Assurance,Quality Assurance\n            Group,Rate of Return,road conditions,road construction,road\n            infrastructure,road maintenance,road management,road\n            networks,road sector,Roads,Rural\n            Roads,structures,supervision,SUSTAINABILITY,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,Transport Policy,Transport Sector,travel\n            time,trucking,TRUNK ROAD,trunk roads"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounts,air transport,Audit\n            reports,bridge,bridges,construction,contractors,decentralization,EXPENDITURE,Financial\n            Audits,gravel,gravel roads,highway\n            projects,Highways,National Roads,periodic\n            maintenance,procurement,Quality Assurance,Quality Assurance\n            Group,Rate of Return,road conditions,road construction,road\n            infrastructure,road maintenance,road management,road\n            networks,road sector,Roads,Rural\n            Roads,structures,supervision,SUSTAINABILITY,Transport,transport\n            infrastructure,Transport Policy,Transport Sector,travel\n            time,trucking,TRUNK ROAD,trunk roads"}},"owner":"AFT: Transport 1 (AFTT1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028186-REIMBURSABLE LOAN\n            ARRANGEMENT-MS.
