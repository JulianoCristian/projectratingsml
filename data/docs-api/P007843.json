Lessons learned\n            are: the ultimate success of the ERL demonstrates that under\n            certain circumstances, the Bank can justify the pursuit of a\n            \"high risk-high reward\" strategy; Design of reform\n            programs should aim for simplicity and compactness.\n            Experience indicates that where there is a need for a reform\n            agenda as broad and complex as the ERL's, it may be\n            preferable to develop several sequential adjustment\n            operations tailored to a borrower's implementation\n            capacity rather than one large operation;  This operation\n            confirms once again the desirability of local ownership of\n            reform programs being shared by the government and key\n            groups in civil society; the ERL demonstrates once again the\n            desirability of having the passage of satisfactory\n            legislation as conditions for Board presentation and not as\n            tranche conditions; and Public expenditure reform should be\n            derived from considerations of the appropriate role of\n            government following a public sector expenditure review, and\n            identification of a systematic set of actions that would\n            ensure achievement of target."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Economic Recovery Loan
