Some\n            lessons learned included: expectations for implementation of\n            reform projects in countries with changing political\n            environments should be realistic and potential\n            implementation delays should be anticipated and proactively\n            addressed, especially in the case of complex projects\n            covering a wide range of activities. This project\n            demonstrated that close work with oblast or rayon\n            authorities, communities, and population was critical for\n            building broad ownership and support to project activities\n            at lower levels. Coordination initiatives should be\n            initiated upstream among Development Partners (DPs')\n            headquarters offices at a program planning stage to avoid\n            constraints in coordination at the country level when\n            DPs' respective programs or projects have been\n            pre-defined at their headquarters. The right composition of\n            a task team, including specialized technical and strong task\n            management and operational skills, is required to supervise\n            complex projects in challenging environments. Streamlined\n            results framework and adequate monitoring arrangements are\n            essential to guide implementation and measure results. The\n            Bank teams should anticipate that construction on new sites\n            may become necessary even if not initially envisaged and,\n            therefore, ensure an appropriate

family doctors working in healthier communities"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This result profile report talks about\n            family doctors working in healthier communities in\n            Tajikistan. Kurbonova treats a wide range of illnesses from\n            coughs and headaches to injuries and depression. Since 2006,\n            the World Bank- funded community and basic health project\n            has been training or retraining doctors and nurses in family\n            medicine, and building clinics in rural communities to\n            provide them with affordable, quality health care. In the\n            aftermath of the civil conflict and economic decline of the\n            1990s, the health sector was in a deep crisis as a result of\n            underfunding and outflow of qualified personnel. In\n            addition, excessive emphasis was placed on hospital care\n            provision over primary healthcare, and it received the bulk\n            of public sector health allocation. That contributed to\n            geographic divisions and underfunding, hampering the\n            efficient use of resources and posing a threat to access to\n            care for low-income groups, particularly in rural areas.\n            Through its healthcare project, the Ministry of Health, the\n            World Bank and other development partners worked to address\n            the imbalances by piloting family medical care, and\n            introducing per capita healthcare funding and a basic\n            benefits package in two large provinces, Khatlon and Soghd.\n            The project included upgrading physical infrastructure that\n            is vital to ensure good quality of services. Eighteen\n            primary healthcare facilities were rehabilitated, as were\n            two family medicine training centers. And 38 new primary\n            healthcare facilities were built in Khatlon and Soghd\n            provinces altogether."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tajik family doctors working in healthier communities"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tajik family doctors working in\n            healthier communities"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2012/04/25102810/tajik-family-doctors-working-healthier-communities","count":"Tajikistan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"skills, communities, health sector, rural\n            communities, physician, clinics, doctor, training, patients,\n            life, access to care, rural areas, family, income,\n            specialists, care, doctors, medicine, all, population,\n            facilities, nurses, services, mothers, funding, health care,\n            community, medical care, headaches, families, health,\n            hospital care, depression, project, basic health, nutrition,\n            illnesses, funds, injuries, mother, rural community,\n            breastfeeding, family medicine"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance","projn":"TJ-Community & Basic Health Project -- P078978,TJ-Community And Basic Health Project -\n            Additional Financing -- P115801","topic":"Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Public Health m1327519 635,Social Development m1327660 134,Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Health Systems Development & Reform,Gender and Health,Housing & Human Habitats,Disease Control & Prevention","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","entityids":{"entityid":"090224b0831132a3_1_0"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Asia!$!545134"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Asia!$!545134"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Asia!$!545134"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Asia!$!545134"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central Asia!$!545134"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","theme":"Health system performance,Population and reproductive health,Health system performance,Child health,Other communicable diseases,Administrative and civil service reform","colti":"Results Profile","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Public Sector Management m1326314 696,Financial Sector Development m1327681 1920,Public Health m1327519 635,Social Development m1327660 134,Health, Nutrition and Population m1327755 621","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
