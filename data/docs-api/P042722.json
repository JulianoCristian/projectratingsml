There are three project components.\n            The first component, federal/regional road and bridge\n            rehabilitation works program, will include the\n            rehabilitation of about 930 km of high priority roads and\n            rehabilitation, repair, reconstruction, replacement, and\n            widening of about 68 high priority bridges under the federal\n            and regional components of the project. The second\n            component, procurement of bridge and road equipment, will\n            include procurement of equipment for office modernization\n            and vehicles, equipment, materials, and supplies as an aid\n            for better management of roads and bridges.
