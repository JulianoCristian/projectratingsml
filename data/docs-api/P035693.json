The\n            lessons learned indicate that this project resulted in a\n            generally satisfactory conclusion, despite numerous\n            difficulties due to its complicated structure involving many\n            beneficiaries, an inefficient technology procurement\n            process, and a number of changes in the Government\n            supervising entity and Bank task management. A key reason\n            for the success achieved was the steady dedication to the\n            project's goals by the implementing agency,\n            participating boiler manufacturers, and Bank team. At\n            project appraisal, all nine of the boiler manufacturers were\n            state-owned enterprises completly owned by their supervising\n            government authorities, and the Ministry of Machinery\n            Industry was charged with responsibility for the direction\n            and development of the industry. The project design\n            reflected this situation, aiming to achieve maximum\n            efficiency gains in each of the main product lines. By\n            adopting practical approaches, the implementing agency,\n            boiler manufacturers and Bank team were able to adapt to\n            many of these changes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Efficient Industrial Boilers Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Efficient Industrial\n            Boilers
