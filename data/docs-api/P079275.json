While this only confirms a\n            broad body of literature, the project showed that the\n            results can be achieved under difficult circumstances such\n            as in the civil service system and a weak implementation\n            capacity. The concept of 'capacity building'\n            incorporates both the strengthening of existing systems and\n            institutional reforms. Human resource development is a key\n            part of capacity building. Because in-service training\n            supported by projects is often not institutionalized and\n            therefore does not follow normal training parameters, it\n            runs the risk of being implemented in such a manner that the\n            training is not effective or does not meet a required\n            standard. To enhance women's participation, affirmative\n            action and gender disaggregation can be a useful starting point."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Rural Capacity Building
