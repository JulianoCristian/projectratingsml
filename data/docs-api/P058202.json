By the project\u0092s end in July 2005,\n            micro-credit loans had helped finance the creation of almost\n            3,000 small enterprises in rural areas; 2,018 schools had\n            been rehabilitated (more than ten times the targeted\n            number); more than 4,000 local government staff had been\n            trained in modern management techniques; 750 km of roads\n            were built - the list goes on and on. But beyond the\n            specific figures, those who worked on the Rural Development\n            Project (RDP) are most proud of the project\u0092s institutional\n            legacy. At a time when decentralization was still a novelty,\n            hundreds of civil servants and officials involved in RDP\n            have gained knowledge in how to implement local development\n            programs in an \u0093effective, transparent and collective way ,\u0094\n            says Lundell. Poland\u0092s decentralization law was adopted in\n            1999, just one year before the start of the World Bank\n            program. Instead of centrally appointed voivods (executive\n            governors) implementing decisions from above, newly elected\n            marshals at the regional level were given the power to\n            decide how to allocate money from the loan and where."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland : Orchestrating a rural revival"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland : Orchestrating a rural revival"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/06/23962113/poland-orchestrating-rural-revival","count":"Poland","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, capacity building, countryside,\n            Decentralization, Economic Growth, families with children,\n            farm employment, farmers, institutional capacity, local\n            participation, Micro-credit, poor, regional development,\n            regional development programs, regional level, roads, Rural,\n            rural areas, Rural Development, rural exodus, rural growth,\n            small town, social assistance, social exclusion,\n            unemployment, water supplies"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Land and Housing m1327648 817,Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Local and Regional Economic Development\n            m1326938 798,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947","projn":"PL-Rural Development Project-313821 -- P058202,PL-Post-Accession Rural Support Project -- P065270","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Housing & Human Habitats,Regional Economic Development,Regional Rural Development","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150205102352"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Water supply,Roads and highways,Micro- and SME finance,Sub-national government administration,Other social services","theme":"Administrative and civil service reform,Other social development,Other social protection and risk management,Participation and civic engagement,Rural policies and institutions,Decentralization,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Rural non-farm income generation","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Poverty Reduction,Rural Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Land and Housing m1327648 817,Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Local and Regional Economic Development\n            m1326938 798,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C","F"],"trustfund":"TF052685-PHRD-POLAND: RURAL DEVELOPMENT\n            PROJECT II,BBFAO-BB FAO,TF022839-GERMAN JPO-MR.

The project ratings\n            are as follows: project outcome is satisfactory;\n            sustainability is likely; institutional development impact\n            is substantial; Bank and Borrower performance is\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from the\n            implementation of the project can be summarized as follows:\n            1) a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) based in a single line\n            ministry cannot fully coordinate a national multi-sectoral\n            rural development project, nor would this be desirable; 2)\n            project design should place a maximum emphasis on\n            decentralization of project implementation, especially if\n            political decentralization to elected regional and local\n            governments is already in place; 3) procurement (even for\n            capacity building activities which emphasize a standardized\n            approach) should be decentralized, with centralization of\n            procurement not exceeding the level of a group of four to\n            five regions at most. 4) a web-based management information\n            system (MIS), integrating local activities to the regional\n            level and regional summaries to the national level is a\n            prerequisite for a fully representative monitoring and\n            evaluation system; 5) in cases where such national programs\n            are designed already, project components should follow the\n            design of national programs as much as possible if they have\n            been generally assessed positively; and 6) an initial Bank\n            project in rural development (or in any decentralized\n            community focused project) should view itself as primarily\n            building capacity for subsequent scaling up through further\n            Bank projects, but especially through an allocation of a\n            wider set of donor and state budget funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Rural Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Rural Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6547442/poland-rural-development-project","projn":"PL-Rural Development Project-313821 -- P058202","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Public Sector Economics,Economic Theory & Research,Labor Markets,Development Economics & Aid Effectiveness","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Poland","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20060120161733"},"subsc":"Micro- and SME finance,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,Other social services","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture, ARMA, Bank loans, benchmark,\n            benchmarks, capacity building, central government control,\n            consolidation, cost effectiveness, creating jobs,\n            Decentralization, decision making, Development Impact,\n            development objectives, development planning, development\n            plans, development policy, development programs, development\n            projects, Econometric analysis, economic analysis, economic\n            development, economic growth, economic information, economic\n            models, Economic Rate of Return, economic situation,\n            employability, employment, employment effect, employment\n            effects, employment growth, employment levels, employment\n            services, financial management, financial planning, GDP,\n            Gross Domestic Product, growth rate, human capital, human\n            resource, human resource management, Institution Building,\n            Institutional Development, job creation, job placement, job\n            training, jobs, labor force, labor market, Labor Offices,\n            Labor Redeployment, local government, local governments,\n            local self governments, Modernization, National Economy,\n            national government, non-farm employment, physical\n            education, political decentralization, positive effects,\n            private sector, private sector participation, productivity,\n            Public, public funds, public infrastructure, public\n            servants, public services, public services in rural areas,\n            RDP, Regional governments, Roads, rural employment, savings,\n            servants, service providers, sewage, small business, small\n            business incubators, social services, Sustainability,\n            Sustainable Development, tax, technical assistance,\n            temporary community employment, temporary employment,\n            training programs, training services, transparent processes,\n            unemployed, unemployment, unemployment benefits,\n            unemployment rate, wages, Water supply, water supply systems"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF022839-GERMAN JPO-MR.

The components\n            include: 1) the development of micro-enterprises to reduce\n            unemployment in rural areas, and allow a comparison of the\n            micro-credit approach, with the current cost of social\n            assistance. Off-farm self-employment will be promoted,\n            through the financing of grants covering social insurance\n            premiums, micro-loans for rural micro-enterprises, advisory\n            services for these enterprises, and technical assistance\n            provision; 2) labor redeployment, through the financing of\n            economic, and labor market surveys, and labor redeployment\n            services. Education financing will improve the quality of\n            teaching, of school equipment, and will support\n            instructional computerization, while institutional\n            development, training programs, and capacity building will\n            strengthen local, and regional administrations; and, 3)\n            technical infrastructure in rural areas, to stimulate\n
