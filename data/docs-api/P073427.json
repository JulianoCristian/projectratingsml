Bulgaria had a satisfactory outcome and moderate\n            risk to development outcome. Both the Bank and the borrower\n            performances were highly satisfactory. The main lessons\n            learned were: 1. Early confidence building is crucial. With\n            the transfer of collection responsibility to the revenue\n            administration, the social security agency loses control\n            over its revenue generation. 2. Integration is a process\n            which involves a multitude of stakeholders. It is important\n            to involve these stakeholders actively in the design and\n            monitoring and active management of the reform process. 3.\n            It is important that strong performance standards are set in\n            relation to collection performance for both tax and social\n            contributions and early measures taken to collect and\n            analyze performance data. 4. Transferring the collection\n            responsibility for local taxes to municipalities is a\n            crucial precondition for achieving substantial efficiency\n            gains in national tax revenue collection. 5. Continuity in\n            the leadership of the tax agency provides an important\n            contribution to successful implementation of the reform\n            process. 6. Tax administration reform and integrating the\n            collection responsibility for social contributions is a\n            multi-year process. A medium to long-term strategic vision,\n            owned by the implementing agency, is a prerequisite for the\n            successful completion and sustainability of the reform\n            process. 7. Business process re-engineering and related\n            automated applications must be fully integrated throughout\n            the tax administration, with appropriate management of the\n            organizational transition \u0096 including human resource and\n            training aspect \u0096 as a central part of the process. 8.\n            Moving to an e-tax system is an essential process for\n            reducing the compliance and administrative burden and the\n            risk of corruption. Increasing the use of electronic tools,\n            in particular e-filing, by taxpayers therefore is important.\n            This requires, in addition to providing incentives for\n            e-filing, to eliminate obstacles and create the necessary\n            legal framework for the use of e-tax. 9. Tax administration\n            reform frequently requires changes in the legal framework.\n            These changes must be initiated as early as possible in\n            order to ensure a clear and sufficient legal basis for the\n            reform. 10. Need for setting realistic, measurable\n            performance targets and avoiding construction\n            works/renovations which often contribute to delays in\n            institutional development projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Revenue Administration Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Revenue Administration\n            Reform
