Some lessons learned included:\n            targeting reduction in consumptive water use and based on ET\n            (Evapotranspiration) can be a powerful instrument for water\n            resources management in conditions of competing water demand\n            for multiple uses, particularly in physical water scarcity\n            areas arid and semi-arid regions in the World. Time is\n            required to change mindsets and demonstrate the necessity of\n            new and advanced concepts and approach, although there have\n            been initial and good outcomes during a very short period of\n            implementation. A new project focusing on implementation of\n            the existing new approach, policy interventions and\n            technologies developed under this project is needed as a\n            follow-up to resolve the potential issues or problems which\n            may be emerged during the project implementation.\n            Coordination of a large network of decentralized management\n            units requires well resourced and highly experienced central\n            coordination. Incentives are required to make the water\n            consumption approach work at farm level. Government\n            investment for not only engineering works but also for\n            supporting agronomic and cropping pattern improvements and\n            improving irrigation management thereby raising farmer\n            incomes and reducing water consumption are important. In the\n            case of the Hai Basin, proximity to large urban markets, it\n            will be important to facilitate cropping change to large\n            extent to produce higher value products per unit of water.\n            Water User Association (WUAs) proved to be an important\n            mechanism that resulted in farmer benefits and water saving."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

The total savings\n            of US$294,160 will be reallocated to the consulting services\n            category in order to hire additional consulting services to:\n            (a) collect monitory and evolution (M&E) data needed to\n            evaluate the project's achievements as the project\n            draws to a close; (b) improve the quality control of project\n            outputs; and (c) hold domestic workshops to enhance project sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Hai Basin Integrated\n            Water and Environment Management Project : restructuring :\n            Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/12/13262805/china-hai-basin-integrated-water-environment-management-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"CN-Hai Basin Integrated Water And\n            Environment Management Project -- P075035","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Housing & Human Habitats,Water and Industry,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Environment,Education,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20101221015236"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Sewerage,Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Education,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements,Water Resources","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"achievements, Cities, competitive bidding,\n            Construction, cost savings, districts, expenditures,\n            groundwater, Municipal Government, overseas study, plant\n            operations, pollution, pollution control, project\n            management, rivers, Small Cities, study tours, wastewater,\n            wastewater treatment, wastewater treatment plant, Water Resources"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia Sustainable Dev (EASCS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"BBGEF-BB GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL FUND,TF030374-CIDA GEF (GEN) CTF FY03 - EAST\n            ASIA & PACIFIC REGION,TF050814-BNWPP-RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT,TF051386-GEF3 PDFB-CHINA:HAI RIVER BASIN\n            INTEGRATED WATER AND ENV.MGT PROJECT,TF051398-GEF3-CHINA:HAI BASIN INTEGRATED\n            WATER AND ENVIRONMENT MANAGEMENT PROJEC,TF053183-GEF3 FSP-CHINA:HAI BASIN\n            INTEGRATED WATER AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT","repnb":"58225"},"9984450":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/10/9984450/improving-coastal-water-quality-through-basin-management-chinas-hai-basin-integrated-water-environment-management-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/10/9984450/improving-coastal-water-quality-through-basin-management-chinas-hai-basin-integrated-water-environment-management-project","new_url":"2008/10/9984450/improving-coastal-water-quality-through-basin-management-chinas-hai-basin-integrated-water-environment-management-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/10/30/000333037_20081030235927/Rendered/INDEX/462380BRI0Box310issue0no0FS251China.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/10/30/000333037_20081030235927/Rendered/PDF/462380BRI0Box310issue0no0FS251China.pdf","docdt":"2008-10-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2008-10-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Improving coastal water quality through\n            basin management : China's Hai Basin Integrated Water\n            and Environment Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Bo Hai Sea is a semi-enclosed\n            international sea located in the northwest corner of the\n            yellow sea. It has globally important ecological resources\n            and provides significant fishery benefits to China, North\n            and South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Fish and shellfish stock\n            in the yellow sea are dependent on the Bo Hai Sea as a\n            reproduction and nursery area. Currently, the Bo Hai Sea is\n            under considerable stress. Pollution, the reduction of\n            freshwater inflows, overfishing and habitat loss has\n            diminished its ecosystem functions. The most seriously\n            affected areas include the estuaries and coastal areas. A\n            lack of effective pollution control for surface and\n            groundwater draining into the Bo Hai Sea has contributed to\n            mass mortality of aquaculture species and an increasing\n            frequency of harmful algal blooms known as 'red\n            tides.' The project's overall objective is to\n            revive the Bo Hai Sea environment with an integrated\n            approach to water resources management and pollution control\n            in the Hai river basin.

The project has the following four\n            components: Component 1) Will finance consultant services,\n            training, goods and small works. The Integrated Water and\n            Environment Management (IWEM) will be divided into 3\n            subcomponents: (a) Strategic Studies at the central and Hai\n            Basin levels; (b) integrated water and environment\n            management planning; and (c) demonstration projects. All\n            three of these subcomponents are very closely interrelated.\n            The strategic studies will support and provide guidance to\n            IWEMPs and to the demonstration projects. Component 2) Will\n            finance consultant services, training and goods and will be\n            implemented under the Hai Basin Project Management Office\n            (PMO). The Knowledge Management (KM) component will have 2\n            subcomponents: (a) KM Development; and (b) Remote Sensing\n            and Evapotranspiration (ET) management systems. These\n            subcomponents are very interrelated and need to be prepared\n            and implemented in a coordinated manner. KM is the technical\n            basis through which the Project will be implemented and all\n            KM activities at all levels are grouped together in this\n            component. Further, to ensure that this remains a\n            needs-driven and not technology-driven component,\n            significant attention will be given to the management of the\n            component.
