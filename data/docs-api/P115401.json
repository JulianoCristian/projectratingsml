Some lessons\n            learned included: the project focused its initial TA\n            activities to support and then subsequently to complement\n            ongoing efforts of the national energy agencies, in\n            particular in Rwanda and Tanzania, where Global Village\n            Energy Partnership (GVEP) was not directly involved in\n            financing sub-grants. Although GVEP did not provide direct\n            financing in those countries, it provided TA to SMEs and\n            project developers in finalizing feasibility studies,\n            environmental and social safeguards studies and business\n            plans, thereby helping make the sub-projects more\n            sustainable and attractive to investors. Cooperation with\n            official agencies is a key success factor and project\n            implementation provided some good examples of such\n            cooperation. Government agencies are primarily focused on\n            large scale infrastructure and grid extension. It is rare to\n            find government agencies actively engaged in nurturing the\n            activity of SMEs in the off-grid energy sector. Governments\n            have important roles in financing such programs, but are\n            seldom in a good position to deliver services directly. In\n            Tanzania and Rwanda, the ESME-SSA project supported SMEs to\n            meet the requirements of government-led agencies to develop\n            projects and expand energy access. This has created further\n            interest in using SMEs as an implementation vehicle to\n            deliver energy services to the poor. Future grants,\n            including the next stage of GVEP support, should avoid any\n            sub-grants directly implemented by the implementing agency\n            as this element added considerable complexity not only in\n            the form of perceived competition from some official\n            agencies, but also in terms of meeting Bank fiduciary requirements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa -
