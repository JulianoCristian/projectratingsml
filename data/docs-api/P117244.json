Some lessons learned\n            included: the major lesson learned from planning and\n            implementation of this Development Policy Loan (DPL) has to\n            do with the case of the initially weak capacity of SEEDUC\n            (State Secretariat of Education), which after the political\n            transition was strengthened and began to mitigate the\n            performance shortcomings that the programs in the education\n            area were exhibiting. This demonstrates the need for strong\n            management in a program's implementing agency in order\n            for implementation not to be derailed and for targeted\n            results to be achieved. Another lesson this DPL taught\n            refers to the appropriateness of the intervening instrument\n            in responding to the needs of the client. A\n            rapidly-disbursing single-tranche DPL is appropriate for\n            clients that need timely responses because of unexpected\n            projected fiscal issues in the specific case of the\n            Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro (GoRJ), and is\n            most likely to be successful with clients that have a robust\n            policy framework, well-defined programs and sound monitoring\n            and evaluation systems in place, as was the case with GoRJ.\n            This DPL also demonstrated the following: (a) the importance\n            of client ownership of the policy program and of close\n            dialogue with the Borrower during both preparation and\n            implementation of the operation; (b) the importance of the\n            technical quality of both World Bank team and implementing\n            agency staff; and (c) the importance of accurate and\n            reliable monitoring and evaluation systems all along the\n            operation cycle, from design, to implementation, to completion."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Fiscal Sustainability, Human\n            Development and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan

of a temporary fall in\n            revenues associated with the recent global financial crisis\n            and economic slowdown. Rio de Janeiro state and federal\n            Government of Brazil requested a single-tranche stand-alone\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) to help with the projected\n            2010 financing needs deriving from reduced projected\n            revenues, mainly due to lower oil royalties, state taxes and\n            intergovernmental transfers and increased expenditures on\n            infrastructure associated with the Program of Accelerated\n            Growth (PAC).

Specifically, the loan supports measures\n            that: (a) strengthen fiscal consolidation through reduced\n            long-term fiscal risk, improved efficiency of tax\n            administration and strengthened budget procedures and\n            financial management; (b) improve quality and efficiency of\n            the business registration process; (c) increase quality
