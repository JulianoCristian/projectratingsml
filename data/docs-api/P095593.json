Some\n            lessons learned include: effective bank project support in\n            fragile and conflict and or post conflict states requires\n            intensive on the ground implementation support. The presence\n            on the ground of more experienced staff can help to unblock\n            many of the constraints that affected implementation.\n            Ideally policy reform components should not be handled\n            through investment lending, but where this was unavoidable\n            because for example a policy action is closely related to an\n            investment and or for lack of an alternative vehicle,\n            borrower ownership and commitment should be assured at\n            design stage and should be managed and monitored during\n            implementation. The risk of Borrower\u0092s lack of commitment to\n            the strategic planning and reform elements of the\n            institutional and capacity building component were not\n            explicitly identified at project design stage. Thus, in the\n            end this component had to be dropped, although interestingly\n            the Government of Timor-Leste (GoTL) is showing a keen\n            interest to reform its power sector. As time progressed it\n            became apparent that Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals\n            and Energy Policy (MNRMEP), Ministry of Infrastructure (MoI)\n            and Electricidade de Timor-Leste\u0092s (EDTL\u0092s) senior\n            management attention is focused on the large system\n            expansion that the government had embarked on and reduced\n            attention was being given the Energy Services Delivery\n            Project (ESDP). Flexible partnership with Borrowers and the\n            exercise of sound judgment are critical for achieving results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Energy Delivery Services

Project in Timor are to stabilize the power\n            services in Dili by restoring or improving operational\n            efficiency, reliability, safety and availability of the\n            power supply, and to promote long-term sustainability of the\n            power sector. The project includes two main components: (a)\n            investments; and (b) capacity building. The investment\n            component would include: (i) emergency repair and\n            maintenance of the Comoro Power Station; (ii) rehabilitation\n            and upgrading of the power distribution system in Dili; and\n            (iii) distribution of energy efficient light bulbs, and\n            compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Timely repair of the power\n            station and energy savings from the above investments will\n            increase availability and reliability of power supply for\n            both existing customers and new customers. A substantial\n            capacity building component is proposed to support project\n            implementation and for institutional and policy\n            strengthening to help lay the groundwork for increased\n            commercial orientation and long-term sustainability of the\n            power sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Energy Services Delivery Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor-Leste - Energy Services\n            Delivery Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/7721238/timor-leste-energy-services-delivery-project","projn":"TP-Energy Services Delivery Project -- P095593","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Energy Production and Transportation,Power & Energy Conversion,Infrastructure Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Energy,Environment","count":"Timor-Leste","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020439_20070614093828"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Energy,Environment","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to electricity, access to energy,\n            access to energy services, accountability, accounting, ADB,\n            auditing, autonomy, availability, balance, cable, capacity\n            building, capital expenditures, collection efficiency,\n            Compact Fluorescent Lamps, Consolidation, cost savings,\n            Customer service, deficits, diesel, diesel generators,\n            diesel oil, economic benefits, economic development,\n            economic efficiency, economic growth, Electric Power,\n            Electricity, Electricity Sector, electricity supply,\n            electrification, end users, energy efficiency, energy\n            efficiency investments, Energy Policy, energy savings,\n            energy sector, Environmental, environmental impacts,\n            environmental issues, Environmental Management,\n            expenditures, financial analyses, Financial Management,\n            fuel, fuel consumption, fuels, generating capacity,\n            generating units, generation capacity, generator, government\n            budget, government subsidies, income, infrastructure\n            services, inventory, investment costs, Investment Program,\n            key performance indicators, Kilowatt-hour, management\n            information systems, Minerals and Energy, Natural Resources,\n            Pacific Region, payback period, peak demand, peak load,\n            penalties, performance indicators, policy decisions, poverty\n            alleviation, Power, power consumption, Power Corporation,\n            power distribution, power distribution system, Power\n            generation, power generation capacity, power lines, Power\n            Plant, power sector, Power Sector Development, Power\n            Station, power stations, power supply, Power Supply System,\n            power system, power systems, private property, public land,\n            rehabilitation investments, reliability improvement,\n            renewable energy, resources management, rural\n            electrification, street lighting, Sustainable Development,\n            technical assistance, Transport, unemployment, voltage"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF030733-AUSTRALIA CTF FY06 - EAST TIMOR\n            LESTE (ALL SECTORS & ALL THEMES),TF030776-PORTUGUESE CTF - FY06 -GLOBAL,TF037825-ARGENTINA - ADVISORY PANEL,TF054670-BNPP-ENERGY: ASIA SUSTAINABLE\n            AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PROGRAM(ASTAE),TF055719-PF III TL-EASIN,TF056327-PHRD-TIMOR-LESTE: ENERGY\n            SERVICES DEVIVERY PROJECT,TF057088-BNPP-ENERGY:  ASIA SUSTAINABLE\n            AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PROGRAM II (ASTAE","repnb":"39717"},"facets":{}}}
