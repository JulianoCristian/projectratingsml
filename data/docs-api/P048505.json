The\n            assessment confirms the following OED lessons of broader\n            relevance. Projects need to dovetail with programs; but\n            well-designed projects can rarely turn around a\n            poorly-designed program. This is a particularly important\n            lesson for the Bank's work in Mexico where leverage is\n            limited. Mexico has ample access to alternative sources of\n            funding, private as well as public. In line with the\n            Bank's poverty reduction mandate, its resources should\n            be tightly targeted, rather than added to programs where\n            there is a high potential for subsidies to be captured by\n            better-off groups. The Bank's leverage may be\n            substantially diluted when project funds flow into a\n            multi-state program which state governments have\n            considerable influence over the use to which resources are\n            put. Large Programs are candidates for formal impact\n            evaluation. In this case, the main limitation of the Alianza\n            evaluation was the absence of a control group of\n            non-beneficiaries, a striking oversight given the level of\n            funding committed. The evaluation should have sampled those\n            who did not apply to the program; and those who did but were\n            rejected. (It is not clear that a list of the rejected is\n            maintained.) Without this control it is impossible to assess\n            claims about the program's leverage: much of the\n            investment (and the income growth attributed to it) might\n            have occurred without a subsidy. Subsidies may have leaked\n            to better-off groups who don't need them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Irrigation and Drainage Sector,\n            On-Farm and Minor Irrigation Networks Improvement, and\n            Agricultural Productivity Improvement Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico -

Among\n            the lessons learned, the project experience suggests\n            cofinancing as an instrument to prod sector policies, target\n            public investment, and concentrate efforts to alleviate\n            poverty, resulting in addition, in a quick disbursement of\n            loan operations. A flexible financing for recurrent costs\n            might motivate States in pursuing Bank procurement, and\n            expenditure procedures. Another lesson suggests that program\n            implementation should include a participative process,\n            articulated within medium term regional, or sectoral\n            programs, while decentralization should not only include\n            municipalities, but be part of the demand-driven,\n            participatory planning approach. Nevertheless, and despite\n            success, emphasis of future projects should be placed on\n            technical assistance, training, and institutional building\n            at the States, and regional levels, based on existing local\n            institutions (government agencies, municipalities,\n            farmer's organizations, nongovernmental organizations,\n            etc.). Their capacity building should be a fundamental\n            ingredient for success. Moreover, adaptive research,\n            technology transfer, and support services should have a\n            strategic, relevant role on all rural development projects\n            targeting small farmers, so as to provide the required\n            public goods for driving the process, and compensate the\n            limited access to improved technologies, and

providing technical and financial assistance to eligible\n            beneficiaries under a matching grant scheme. There are three\n            components. The first, productive investment, finances small\n            grants for demand-driven subprojects aimed at small\n            irrigation development and modernization, improved pasture\n            establishment and management, and improved dairy production\n            technology and marketing as well as subprojects providing\n            small-scale on-farm infrastructure and minor equipment and\n            supplies. The second component, production support services,\n            includes financial support for applied research and\n            technology transfer as well as demand-driven extension, and\n            technical assistance and training to small farmers. The\n            third component, institutional strengthening and project\n            administration, supports training and technical assistance\n            to staff with implementation responsibilities at the central\n            and state levels, with particular emphasis on preparing\n            subprojects, selecting mechanisms and procedures, developing\n            and
