Some lessons\n            learned included: procurement arrangements should also be\n            tailored to the specific circumstances of emergency\n            operations with considerable built-in flexibility. Project\n            Preparation advance and advance procurement are some of the\n            instruments to expedite procurement processes. Close\n            coordination of donors and clear delineation of\n            responsibilities is important in ensuring a comprehensive\n            response from the donor community. It contributes to\n            effective and timely response and lack of duplication of\n            efforts. The specific responsibilities need to be assigned\n            early in the process and need to be based on each\n            institution's comparative advantage. Government\n            commitment and an experienced and motivated counterpart are\n            of paramount importance to ensure speedy preparation and\n            timely implementation. Although emergency operations are not\n            designed to address long-term policy issues, they serve as\n            good entry points for a longer term engagement. As such, it\n            will be prudent for emergency operations to be followed by a\n            longer-term engagement, as was the case in this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic -
