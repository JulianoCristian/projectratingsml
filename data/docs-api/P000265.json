The last disbursement was made on October 27,\n            1989. The main objective of the Pilot Project was to\n            determine (i) if a number of economically viable technical\n            messages existed for the northern part of the CRPA, and if\n            their application would produce good results; and (ii) if it\n            was possible to overcome the socio-cultural and demographic\n            factors hindering the adoption of proven technical\n            innovations applicable to the southern part. To accomplish\n            this, the project was to identify and put into place an\n            agricultural system based on methods capable of preventing,\n            slowing or indeed totally stopping soil degradation.

Second these farmers were not only able to\n            see for themselves how the proposed technical message worked\n            through the duration of the experiment but also how to adapt\n            the technical content of the test as experience was gained."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso -

The second lesson is that there\n            are benefits to be derived from doing applied research with\n            a network of interested volunteer farmers. First of all like\n            most volunteers, the farmers who volunteered to do the\n            testing were keenly interested in their work and performed\n            the test well. Second these farmers were not only able to\n            see for themselves how the proposed technical message worked\n            through the duration of the experiment but also how to adapt\n            the technical content of the test as experience was gained."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Projet Pilote de\n            Developpement Agricole de Koudougou"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso \u2013 Projet pilote de\n            d\u00e9veloppement agricole de Koudougou : Burkina Faso\u00a0- Projet\n            pilote de d\u00e9veloppement agricole de Koudougou"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1991/01/12686264/burkina-faso-koudougou-agricultural-pilot-project-burkina-faso-projet-pilote-de-developpement-agricole-de-koudougou","projn":"BF-Koudougou Pilot -- P000265","subtopic":"Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies","docty":"Project Completion Report","teratopic":"Agriculture,Environment","count":"Burkina Faso","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000334955_20100824034442"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Agriculture,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Animal husbandry; Agricultural research;\n            Agricultural extension; Cultivation systems; Crops;\n            Extension services; Farm management; Farming systems;\n            Fertilizers; Pilot projects; Training & visit systems;\n            Area development,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Animal husbandry; Agricultural research;\n            Agricultural extension; Cultivation systems; Crops;\n            Extension services; Farm management; Farming systems;\n            Fertilizers; Pilot projects; Training & visit systems;\n            Area development,,"}},"owner":"WB Off:Abidjan-F2:CI/BJ/TG/BF/GN (AFCF2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"9296","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Projet Pilote de\n            Developpement Agricole de Koudougou"}}},"723081":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1982/09/723081/upper-volta-koudougou-agricultural-pilot-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1982/09/723081/upper-volta-koudougou-agricultural-pilot-project","new_url":"1982/09/723081/upper-volta-koudougou-agricultural-pilot-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/21/000178830_98101902403053/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/03/21/000178830_98101902403053/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1293","datestored":"2000-03-21T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1982-09-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Upper Volta - Koudougou Agricultural Pilot Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Koudougou Pilot Agricultural Project\n            will consist of strengthening and reorganizing the extension\n            service according to the training and visit system and\n            provision of inputs and equipment.
