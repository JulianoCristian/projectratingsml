Some lessons learned included: a clear and\n            realistic definition of program objectives is essential to\n            ensure a common vision of the long-term goals being sought\n            and to measure ongoing progress. Objectives should be linked\n            closely to a realistic impact assessment. A change in\n            administrations during the life of a project may lead to\n            delays in project implementation as well as the likelihood\n            of redefinitions in reform priorities, which may affect\n            long-term government commitment to certain reform components\n            and thus future sustainability.
