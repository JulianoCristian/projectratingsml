The\n            borrower was the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Telecomunicaciones\n            (IETEL), which later became Empresa Estatal de\n            Telecomunicaciones EMETEL Ecuador (EMETEL). The Loan was\n            approved by the board on May 4, 1989, signed on September\n            28, 1989 and made effective on April 9, 1990. This PCN has\n            been prepared in lieu of a Project Completion Report,\n            because no disbursements took place, and the loan was\n            cancelled at the request of the borrower on January 7, 1994.\n            The project objectives are as follows: (a) improve the\n            quality of, and access to, telecommunications services in\n            Ecuador through rehabilitation and expansion of the\n            telecommunications network and replacement of obsolete\n            equipment; (b) strengthen IETEL/EMETELs management and\n            organization and increase its commercial orientation; and\n            (c) improve service to business subscribers by modernizing\n            and expanding international telephone, telex, and data\n            services. Lessons learned are as follows: the project was\n            identified and appraised, and the loan was negotiated with a\n            government which was committed to and fully supportive of\n            the project objectives. Unfortunately, a new government took\n            power which had other priorities, and the project\n            languished. In countries such as Ecuador, where regimes\n            seldom if ever remain in power for a second term, it is\n            important to receive assurances of continued dedication to\n            Bank financed projects under way, each time there is a\n            change of administration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -
