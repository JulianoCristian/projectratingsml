The lessons learned indicate that despite\n            the time pressure during project preparation and appraisal,\n            a lot of attention was paid to design details including\n            breakdown of costs and procurement down to county level.\n            Even more importantly, the scope of the project was well\n            focused, and preparation avoided the inclusion of too many\n            or too sophisticated components, and the borrower can make a\n            significant positive impact in improving the lives of\n            lower-income communities, especially in emergency\n            situations. The operation showed that rapid and effective\n            decisions by both the Bank In emergency reconstruction\n            programs, early availability of funds or authorization,\n            together with competent business procedures and record\n            keeping are essential to address the disaster repairs in a\n            timely manner. Procurement procedures have to take into\n            account the emergency nature of the project and be\n            implemented by well-trained staff. Assisting individual\n            households in their recovery from an emergency situation\n            requires considerable attention to a well thought-through\n            targeting of the limited resources. Due to its emergency\n            response nature, the project focused on reconstruction of\n            physical and social infrastructure. A strong emphasis on\n            input and output monitoring, reporting, and supervision\n            contributed to a quality implementation of the project.

World Bank\n            performance is evaluated as satisfactory due to the high\n            quality and innovative nature of its lending activities and\n            its persistent, yet flexible and supportive role in project\n            supervision.

The following lessons can be learned: The key\n            to the project's success or failure is the continuity\n            and quality of key personnel on the Borrower's as well\n            as on the Association's end: with the right people in\n            place, complex urban projects, albeit more time-consuming in\n            their preparation and their supervision, can be implemented\n            successfully.

During preparation, it is\n            important not only to review the organizational set-up of\n            project management, but also to ensure that there is an\n            explicit commitment by the authorities to provide adequate\n            funding for these units. Cultural preservation of historic\n            buildings, if properly integrated with urban development,\n            can raise ownership pride and commitment by the implementing\n            agencies, and appreciation and support by the citizens.
