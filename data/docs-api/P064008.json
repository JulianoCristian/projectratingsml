These projects represent a clear\n            evolution in the scope of World Bank lending: the first\n            project was nationwide and concentrated on procurement and\n            installation of equipment in selected water systems in each\n            of the 36 Nigerian states and the National Federal\n            Territory; the second project was restricted to two states\n            (Kaduna and Katsina); and the third project directly\n            assisted 16 small towns. This assessment rated the outcome\n            of the National Water Rehabilitation Project as highly\n            unsatisfactory, sustainability highly unlikely, negligible\n            institutional development Impact, and unsatisfactory\n            performances by both the Bank and Borrower.  For the First\n            Multi-State Water Supply Project, the assessment concurred\n            with the completion report, except that the PPAR rated the\n            outcome as moderately satisfactory. The PPAR rated the\n            outcome of the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation\n            Project as satisfactory with likely sustainability,\n            substantial institutional development impact and\n            satisfactory performances by both the Bank and Borrower.\n            There are three principal lessons: First, the targets under\n            the MDGs for water supply and sanitation, focusing only on\n            service coverage and access, need to be expanded to include\n            the reliability and quality of water supplies.  Second,\n            effective coordination between central, state and local\n            governments requires demand-driven approaches where the\n            consumers have the initiative. Third, maintenance merits\n            priority over new works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - National Water Rehabilitation,\n            First Multi-State Water Supply, and Small Towns Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - National Water\n            Rehabilitation, First Multi-State Water Supply, and Small\n            Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/06/6933883/nigeria-national-water-rehabilitation-first-multi-state-water-supply-small-towns-water-supply-sanitation-projects","projn":"NG-Small Towns Water -- P064008,NG-Water Rehab -- P002084,NG-State Water I -- P002109","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Infrastructure Regulation,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20060719121550"},"subsc":"Water supply,Other industry,Central government administration,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to safe water, access to water\n            supply, adequate sanitation, administrative support,\n            bacteriological quality, Basin Development, broad range,\n            central government, child mortality, community\n            participation, competitive bidding, continuity of service,\n            distribution systems, Electric Power, groundwater,\n            groundwater sources, households, incentive structure, large\n            water resource, least cost, liters per capita per day, local\n            communities, maintenance of water, maintenance standards,\n            management of water, mortality rate, natural resources,\n            operational performance, operational performance indicators,\n            Operational Policies, pathogens, performance indicators,\n            piped water, pollution, population growth, population growth\n            rate, potable water, power supply, private operators,\n            programs, project management, provision of water, provision\n            of water supply, quality of service, quality of water,\n            quantity of water, River Basin, sanitary excreta disposal,\n            sanitation sector, sanitation services, service delivery,\n            service demand, service quality, Small Town, Small Town\n            project, Small Town Water, Small Town Water Supply, SMALL\n            TOWNS, SMALL TOWNS WATER SUPPLY, STATE WATER, sustainable\n            use, training needs, transaction costs, transparency, urban\n            areas, Urban Water, Utility staff, Water Board, Water\n            Boards, water distribution, water projects, water quality,\n            water quality data, water quality studies, water resource,\n            Water Resources, water samples, Water Sector, Water Sector\n            Reform, water service, water services, water supplies, WATER\n            SUPPLY, water supply projects, water supply service, water\n            supply services, water supply systems, water system, water\n            systems, water treatment"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"2":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF027200-NATIONAL WATER REHABILITATION FUND,TF040474-NIGERIA:  STATE WATER I -\n            PROJECT ANALYSIS IN PREPARATION OF THE ICR,TF038558-NIGERIA: SMALL TOWNS W.

Several lessons are drawn from the project,\n            namely, that interventions should be geographically limited,\n            i.e., location impacts supervision, and therefore\n            implementation. The Bank needs to limit its interventions\n            geographically so that adequate supervision (and adequate\n            supervision funds) be physically possible, and a substantial\n            impact made. Any intervention over a wide spatial\n            distribution will challenge the quality of supervision, and\n            dilute the impact. The states in the country, being\n            responsible for water supply and sanitation (WSS) provision,\n            should therefore be the implementing entities for water\n            supply and sanitation projects. The federal\n            government's role should be limited to monitoring and\n            evaluation. In addition, given the local government's\n            relationship with the communities, they should be involved\n            in implementing community based projects, under the proviso\n            of understanding and leveraging communities'\n            capabilities. Although the project was not negatively\n            impacted by a lack of donor coordination, it is evident that\n            other donors are likely to repeat the experiences of this\n            Bank funded project. Despite the Bank's efforts, other\n            programs have thus far, not incorporated these lessons into\n            ongoing activities. It does not help that the recipient\n            federal ministries differ depending upon whether the support\n            is a credit or a grant, the Federal Government and donors\n            need to coordinate their activities so as to ensure more\n            effective implementation. Furthermore, lessons also suggest\n            encouraging 'self-supervision' by project\n            executers, enhancing independent monitoring and evaluation\n            capacity, and, focusing on sustainability - not asset\n            building. It is recommended to scale-up the\n            Government's Small Towns (STWSS) program, based on\n            criteria where States are the implementers; geographic space\n            is limited in accordance to project design and\n            pre-determined capabilities; the Government's\n            commitment to sustainable STWSS, is supported by the\n            communities in their contribution to costs, not undermining\n            through parallel schemes dispensing free WSS services. But\n            most importantly, the Federal Government should establish a\n            formal mechanism to coordinate the support it is receiving\n            from donors in the water sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nigeria - Small Towns Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Program Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nigeria - Small Towns Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Program Pilot Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5610232/nigeria-small-towns-water-supply-sanitation-program-pilot-project","projn":"NG-Small Towns Water -- P064008","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Services to the Poor,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions","teratopic":"Urban Development","count":"Nigeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050217143144"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Other industry","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic services, communities, community\n            development, engineers, health practices, homes, households,\n            hygiene, inhabitants, innovation, intervention, legal\n            protection, Lessons Learned, new towns, PCD, Pollution,\n            private sector, procurement, procurement procedures, Project\n            implementation, project preparation, Quality Control,\n            Rehabilitation, rural areas, Rural Development, SANITATION,\n            service provision, SMALL TOWNS, urban areas, urban services,\n            ventilation, WATER SUPPLY, workers, youth"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Learning and Innovation Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF038558-NIGERIA: SMALL TOWNS W.
