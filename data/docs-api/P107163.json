Some lessons learned included:\n            policy reforms are implemented and therefore driven by the\n            middle level government officials across the range of\n            ministries. Reforms should therefore incorporate the\n            tactical and political sense of these key government\n            counterparts when designing the pace and scope of a program.\n            Where consensus is uncertain, a deliberation process along\n            with modest expectations should be established up front to\n            allow policy options to be explored and breakthroughs to\n            emerge. To support such a process, constant dialogue between\n            the Government and the Bank is fundamental and is best\n            facilitated by a strong field presence across a wide range\n            of sectors which views policy discussions as a natural part\n            of ongoing support. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system for IDPL lacked in places, quantitative indicators,\n            baseline data, strong targets and a system for monitoring\n            and recalibration of variables. For the system to be a\n            useful management tool for Government, it is important for\n            outcomes to be monitored and attributed to design and\n            implementation issues, so that the latter can receive\n            attention. For this to occur, integration of the M&E\n            framework with the results framework is needed so: (i)\n            objectives are explicitly stated, (ii) associated outcomes\n            are targeted with numerical indicators, (iii) policy actions\n            are specified which will credibly influence the targeted\n            indicators, and (iv) on-going calibration of policy changes,\n            external changes and targeted indicators are carried out as\n            part of Government functions to support implementation of a\n            multi-year, multi-sector program of the complexity of the\n            IDPL series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Infrastructure Development Policy Loans
