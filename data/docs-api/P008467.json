In\n            accordance with these objectives, the project is composed of\n            three components; firstly, investment in commercially\n            oriented sub-projects via participating Hungarian banks.\n            These sub-projects are grouped in three areas: R/D\n            infrastructure, new industrial technology, and computer\n            software. Second, the project will finance two pre-appraised\n            investments in non-commercial, government owned entities\n            which provide essential services to TD activities. Finally,\n            the project will provide technical assistance to train staff\n            from enterprises, Hungarian banks and government\n            departments, and to assist in appraisal of sub-projects, and\n            also to support the preparation of the next mid-range plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Hungary - Technology Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Hungary - Technology Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/05/739374/hungary-technology-development-project","projn":"HU-Technology I -- P008467","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,ICT Policy and Strategies,General Technology","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Hungary","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926194133"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other industry","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting practices,banking\n            system,bidding,commercial banks,computer aided\n            design,computer aided manufacturing,computer\n            technology,credit risk,debt,economic\n            reform,engineering,expenditures,financial\n            institutions,fiscal deficits,FISCAL\n            YEAR,GNP,Government,industrial enterprises,industrial\n            technology,maturities,maturity,National Bank of Hungary,new\n            technologies,new technology,Oil,operating\n            costs,patents,productivity,productivity\n            growth,programs,project evaluation,savings,software\n            industry,subsidiary,technical assistance,technological\n            development,Technology Development,Telecommunications,Transport"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting practices,banking\n            system,bidding,commercial banks,computer aided\n            design,computer aided manufacturing,computer\n            technology,credit risk,debt,economic\n            reform,engineering,expenditures,financial\n            institutions,fiscal deficits,FISCAL\n            YEAR,GNP,Government,industrial enterprises,industrial\n            technology,maturities,maturity,National Bank of Hungary,new\n            technologies,new technology,Oil,operating\n            costs,patents,productivity,productivity\n            growth,programs,project evaluation,savings,software\n            industry,subsidiary,technical assistance,technological\n            development,Technology Development,Telecommunications,Transport"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"P4787"},"facets":{}}}
