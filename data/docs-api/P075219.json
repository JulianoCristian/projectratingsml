to achieve effective biodiversity\n            conservation in Central America - Guatemala, Belize,\n            Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama -\n            by strengthening the capacity of indigenous communities to\n            protect, and manage their natural and cultural resources,\n            and, by recuperating and promoting their cultural values,\n            and sustainable traditional land use practices, thereby\n            preventing further land degradation that threatens\n            environmental services, livelihoods, and economic\n            well-being, and, conserving the region's high, though\n            increasingly threatened, biodiversity resources. The\n            components are : 1) Cultural and institutional\n            strengthening, and capacity building of participating\n            communities, which consists of a) generation and\n            strengthening of the organizational, technical and\n            administrative capacities of indigenous communities\n            regarding the application of their cultural values to the\n            management of their natural resources; b) standardization\n            and criteria formation for traditional ecosystem management\n            of indigenous communities, including a certification process\n            for them to engage in effective ecosystem management, and;\n            c) strengthening empowerment capacities of community\n            organizations for traditional ecosystem management. 2)\n            Promotion of sustainable cultural land use and traditional\n            ecosystem management entails the development of a\n            progressive series of community conservation, and\n            sustainable cultural land use plans that together can form a\n            network of land use areas, to yield greater collective\n            conservation impacts, actually focused on actual planning\n            and management of conservation areas. 3) Development of\n            culturally appropriate products, markets, and services for\n            environmental sustainability in indigenous communities will\n            channel grant resources to develop financial mechanisms at\n            the community level. Specifically, it will finance a\n            progressive series of community biodiversity conservation,\n            and sustainable use subprojects, compatible with the land\n            use plans. Grant activities will focus on income-generating\n            opportunities in four categories: a) traditional products;\n            b) environmental services; c) eco/ethnotourism; and, d)\n            traditional ecosystem management models. 4) Participatory\n            project monitoring and evaluation will support training and\n            capacity building on monitoring and evaluation of project\n            impacts, and also progress in conservation and sustainable\n            use of biological diversity. It will finance scientifically\n            sound monitoring and evaluation of biodiversity, to follow\n            project implementation and biodiversity changes over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and the Caribbean -

The project has been classified as\n            Category B in compliance with the Bank's environmental\n            assessment policy, particularly regarding productive,\n            community subproject implementation. It is worth mentioning,\n            this is not expected to cause major environmental\n            degradation, however, given some subproject sites are\n            located within highly sensitive environmental, and social\n            areas, an environmental management framework is thus\n            required. Subprojects shall undergo an environmental\n            screening to determine whether it falls under high,\n            moderate, low, or, with no environmental risk. Those\n            subprojects classified within a high to moderate risk, will\n            require an environmental assessment, and management plan;\n            moderate to low risk (generally located within buffer zones,\n            identified as important biological and social ecosystems),\n            will require an environmental report; while, those with no\n            environmental impact will only be subject to relevant\n            technical environmental specifications. Subprojects in, and\n            around protected areas, or within critical natural habitats,\n            will undergo environmental mitigation, such as soil\n            protection, and specific land uses. Reforestation projects\n            will require management plans to ensure its sustainability.\n            If indigenous populations are to be affected, an indigenous\n            peoples plan based on consultations, and community\n            participation will be developed. Particular attention will\n            be given to archaeological or cultural sites, to be\n            protected as possible. The report provides recommendations,\n            and mitigation measures against potential, major adverse\n            impacts, such as: petroleum exploration works, roads\n            construction, livestock expansion and production,\n            pastoralism, agricultural development, and possible timber extraction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latin America and the Caribbean -
