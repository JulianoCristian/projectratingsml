Sustainability is\n            rated as unlikely through lack of ongoing maintenance and\n            means to fund it. Bank performance  rated satisfactory\n            mainly for the good quality at entry of this project.\n            Borrower  performance is also rated satisfactory, despite\n            sometimes lethargic management of procurement. For not\n            achieving its major objectives but still producing a few\n            worthwhile results,  the overall outcome of the Colombo\n            Urban Transport Project   is rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory. Sustainability is rated as unlikely.  Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; poor quality at entry with a\n            design committed to reforms-a legacy of a larger, abandoned\n            project-not supported by the borrower and lacking\n            instruments to achieve them.  Borrower performance is also\n            rated unsatisfactory; procurement was protracted, sometimes\n            featuring ad hoc acquisitions. The overall outcome of the\n            Colombo Environmental Improvement Project  is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Sustainability is rated as unlikely; Bank\n            performance is rated  unsatisfactory; poor quality came from\n            a rigid project design that failed to effectively involve\n            either borrower or beneficiaries. Borrower performance is\n            also rated unsatisfactory, principally because of the\n            failure to implement solutions for solid waste and\n            wastewater pollution. Overall outcome of the Year 2000\n            Emergency Assistance Project is rated moderately\n            satisfactory, as the project apparently achieved its\n            intended objective, but with significant shortcomings; an\n            unclear counterfactual and public agencies receiving project\n            support after January 1,2000, and yet suffering no Y2K\n            disruption. Sustainability is likely, since Sri\n            Lanka's economy and banking sectors have already\n            demonstrated their resilience to a Y2K-type event. For its\n            rapid project preparation and close supervision, Bank\n            performance is rated satisfactory. For borrower\n            performance, the rating is also satisfactory, given strong\n            project ownership and efficient  implementation by the\n            Government authorities concerned. Experience with these\n            projects confirms the following OED lessons:  1)  Project\n            performance is vulnerable to the impact of conflict,\n            especially through unexpected  conflict events during\n            project implementation. Spatially separating a project from\n            active  conflict zones does not mean that an operation will\n            be free of conflict constraints.  2) Project design should\n            not be blind to conflict, and must cautiously but explicitly\n            address the  constraints imposed. War-weary governments are\n            unlikely to have strong ownership of  reform that is\n            unrelated to the causes of the conflict.  3)  It is\n            important to focus upon a clear vision of the intended\n            development results of a project and to remain focused on\n            them through systematic monitoring and evaluation. In other\n            words, the baseline should be measured, the counterfactual\n            clearly understood, and monitoring and evaluation supported\n            and implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

Although the overall results\n            of the project remain unsatisfactory, many lessons can be\n            learned form this project: 1) while the Bank's general\n            policy is not to extend the credit closing date, it seems\n            that in this project there were sufficient grounds to do so\n            for certain components. The Bank should have considered\n            restructuring the project earlier to complete at least some\n            of the components as originally planned. 2) Compromising on\n            the requirement for upfront agreements on critical\n            prerequisites for the success of the project leads to\n            incomplete and unsustainable outcomes. 3) It is important to\n            avoid in project design lumping together discrete\n            components, each of them complex in nature, to form a\n            project which involves various agencies. 4) Strong\n            government's and other stakeholders' commitment\n            and ownership of reforms is one key factor to successful\n            project implementation. 5) Frequent changes of task\n            leadership without adequate overlap and orientation have\n            contributed to delays in the decision-making process. 6)\n            Early identification of critical issues and proactive\n            modification of the project as needed could lead to a\n            greater likelihood of achieving the project objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

The project comprises four major\n            components. The first is a municipal solid waste management\n            component which will support the construction of a sanitary\n            landfill, construction of a 100 tons/day capacity compost\n            plant the Welisara landfill, provision of potable water\n            supply and other infrastructure for the communtiy residing\n            adjacent to the landfill site and the purchase of equipment\n            and vehicles for safe collection, transport and final\n            disposal of hospital wastes at the Welisara landfill. The\n            second component supports a wastewater collection system for\n            construction of a sewer network in each of the two\n            industrialized zones, Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, to collect\n            and carry industrial and domestic wastewaters to two\n            separate wastewater treatment plants built by the private\n            sector. The third component supports a pollution control\n            program in the Beira Lake catchment for the interception of\n            unauthorized wastewater outlets now discharging to the storm\n            drainage system and connecting them to existing sewerage\n            system and reduction of sewerage overflows through cleaning\n            sewer lines, rehabilitating pumping station, and adding a\n            sewer line along the northwest bank of the East Lake. The\n            final component is a technical assistance component\n            consisting of project preparation assistance, project\n            implementation support, technical assistance to the

The project comprises four major\n            components. The first is a municipal solid waste management\n            component which will support the construction of a sanitary\n            landfill, construction of a 100 tons/day capacity compost\n            plant the Welisara landfill, provision of potable water\n            supply and other infrastructure for the communtiy residing\n            adjacent to the landfill site and the purchase of equipment\n            and vehicles for safe collection, transport and final\n            disposal of hospital wastes at the Welisara landfill. The\n            second component supports a wastewater collection system for\n            construction of a sewer network in each of the two\n            industrialized zones, Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, to collect\n            and carry industrial and domestic wastewaters to two\n            separate wastewater treatment plants built by the private\n            sector. The third component supports a pollution control\n            program in the Beira Lake catchment for the interception of\n            unauthorized wastewater outlets now discharging to the storm\n            drainage system and connecting them to existing sewerage\n            system and reduction of sewerage overflows through cleaning\n            sewer lines, rehabilitating pumping station, and adding a\n            sewer line along the northwest bank of the East Lake. The\n            final component is a technical assistance component\n            consisting of project preparation assistance, project\n            implementation support, technical assistance to the CMC and\n            technical assistance to the Urban Development Authority."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -

It provides the final environmental\n            impact assessment (EIA) for the landfill site of the project\n            which will serve the disposal needs of the Colombo\n            metropolitan area over the next 15 years.  The overall solid\n            waste management system will also include one or more\n            transfer stations, through which a proportion of the\n            collected waste arisings will be processed for\n            cost-effective bulk delivery to the landfill site.  The\n            potential environmental impact at the selected transfer\n            station site is also addressed in this report.  The\n            description and evaluation of the potential environmental\n            impacts are addressed under the following headings:\n            socio-cultural factors; hydrogeology and hydrology;\n            biological factors; air quality; traffic; aesthetics; and\n            noise.  Section 2 of the report discusses the policy, legal\n            and administrative framework of the EIA process.  Section 3\n            describes the analysis of alternatives to the proposed\n            landfill site.  Section 4 provides a description of the\n            landfill design and method of operation.  Section 5 provides\n            a description of the Welisara site, including the key\n            existing environmental aspects and conditions.  Section 6\n            presents an assessment of the environmental impacts of the\n            development of the site, and highlights the mitigation\n            measures to be employed.  Finally, section 7 provides a\n            summary of the environmental mitigation and monitoring plan\n            in tabular format, including a description of the mitigation\n            measures that were proposed for the site in section 6, and\n            recommendations for an ongoing environmental monitoring program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -
