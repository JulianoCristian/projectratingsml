On the business environment, participating\n            enterprises must be willing to innovate, build sound\n            management teams, and prepare a realistic business plan.\n            Likewise, the competitiveness of foreign currency\n            denominated loans for sub-borrowers should be evaluated, in\n            particular when the major investment items - equipment and\n            works - are locally available, and major project outputs are\n            destined for domestic market.
