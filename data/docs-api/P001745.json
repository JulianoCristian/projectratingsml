Although, substantial investments\n            in land and water conservation measures in various villages\n            were made, and  a significant amount of infrastructure\n            (schools, wells, granaries, health clinics, etc.) was\n            constructed, the project was not successful in resolving\n            some critical institutional issues fundamental to\n            \"establishing a rational land use system.\" The\n            PPAR rates sustainability as unlikely because of several\n            factors, among others, the significant scaling up. A\n            dramatic increase in targets (400 percent) made it very\n            difficult to allow for the essential elements of\n            sustainability to be put in place in the communities.\n            Institutional development impact is rated substantial rather\n            than high. The PPAR rates Bank performance unsatisfactory\n            for several reasons. There were two safeguard violations and\n            the scaling up at the time of the mid-term review was\n            heavy-handed and in total disregard to the spirit of\n            collaboration and empowerment that the project was\n            attempting to build. Moreover, though the Natural Resource\n            Management Project (NRM) was the first phase of a long term\n            program, the Bank has not followed through effectively and\n            in a timely manner on the planned next phase. The Community\n            Based Rural Development Project is meant to be a follow-on\n            to the NRM Project, but it has not yet been approved and a\n            gap of a couple of years is enough to lose the momentum of\n            the first phase. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.\n            The assessment notes some issues that merit consideration in\n            future Bank interventions. The experience of the Mali NRM\n            Project also offers three important lessons for future Bank-\n            supported community-driven development interventions in Mali\n            and elsewhere: Innovative, complex, and process-oriented\n            Bank interventions (like the Mali NRM Project) require\n            strong and constant Bank management oversight to ensure that\n            implementation is aligned with design and that Bank\n            procedures and policies are strictly met. In interventions\n            like the Mali NRM. Project, performance indicators need to\n            be designed upfront to monitor and track qualitative as well\n            as quantitative progress on achievement of objectives.\n            Although it is difficult to measure the quality of capacity\n            building and community participation in decision making, in\n            the absence of any attempts, it is likely to receive less\n            attention as project teams become preoccupied with meeting\n            progress on quantitative targets. The harmonization of the\n            natural resource management regime with the decentralization\n            process is an issue that needs urgent attention. Although\n            the commune is the lowest level of government in the\n            country, most of the activities supported by the NRM Project\n            were carried out at the village level. Clarity on how\n            activities begun at the village level will continue to\n            receive support in order to become sustainable is essential."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Natural Resource Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Natural Resource\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/2829922/mali-natural-resource-management-project","projn":"ML-Natural Resource Management Project -- P001745","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Banks & Banking Reform,Forestry,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mali","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20031230120642"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Forestry,Crops","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            lands,Agricultural production,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,audits,Bank management,Bank\n            Performance,Bank procedures,beans,biodiversity,capacity\n            building,cassava,common lands,cost of\n            capital,cotton,crops,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,decision\n            making,deforestation,degradation,drought,droughts,environmental\n            impacts,environmental information,environmental\n            management,environmental\n            protection,equipment,erosion,erosion\n            control,exploitation,extension,FAO,Fiscal Year,fish,food\n            processing,forest,Forestry,forests,Human\n            Development,income,Institutional Development,irrigation,land\n            improvement,land management,land rights,Land tenure,land\n            use,land use\n            system,land-use,laws,legislation,Livestock,local\n            government,maize,National Forestry,Natural Resource,natural\n            resource degradation,Natural Resource Management,natural\n            resources,NGOs,nongovernmental organizations,participatory\n            approaches,pastures,peer review,Poverty Reduction,private\n            sector,rangelands,regeneration,resource allocations,resource\n            use,Rice,rural development,soil\n            conservation,sorghum,sustainable use,technical\n            assistance,trees,UNDP,water supply,wildlife,yams"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,agricultural growth,agricultural\n            lands,Agricultural production,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,audits,Bank management,Bank\n            Performance,Bank procedures,beans,biodiversity,capacity\n            building,cassava,common lands,cost of\n            capital,cotton,crops,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,decision\n            making,deforestation,degradation,drought,droughts,environmental\n            impacts,environmental information,environmental\n            management,environmental\n            protection,equipment,erosion,erosion\n            control,exploitation,extension,FAO,Fiscal Year,fish,food\n            processing,forest,Forestry,forests,Human\n            Development,income,Institutional Development,irrigation,land\n            improvement,land management,land rights,Land tenure,land\n            use,land use\n            system,land-use,laws,legislation,Livestock,local\n            government,maize,National Forestry,Natural Resource,natural\n            resource degradation,Natural Resource Management,natural\n            resources,NGOs,nongovernmental organizations,participatory\n            approaches,pastures,peer review,Poverty Reduction,private\n            sector,rangelands,regeneration,resource allocations,resource\n            use,Rice,rural development,soil\n            conservation,sorghum,sustainable use,technical\n            assistance,trees,UNDP,water supply,wildlife,yams"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 3 (AFTS3)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF022955-MALI-NATURAL RESOURCE\n            MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF023570-GLO.

Project components were modified\n            by splitting the Institutional Support for Government\n            Services from the Environmental Information Services\n            component; expanding from 150 to 600 to 844 the targeted\n            villages, while at the same time quartering the amount per\n            village and curtailing funding of social investments; and\n            adding communes to villages.
