In Nepal this assessment found while it made\n            sense for donors' projects to be geographically\n            differentiated this was at the expense of sector-wide\n            coordination and mutual learning. Do not lose sight of\n            project beneficiaries. Too much attention to water resource\n            policy and management deflected attention from the need to\n            reform public sector management of large-scale irrigation\n            projects and improve service delivery. As a result the\n            longer-term sustainability of the public irrigation\n            subsector and farmers' livelihoods dependent on it are\n            at high risk in Nepal. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\n            are generally better at working with farmers to increase the\n            productivity of small-scale farmer-managed irrigation\n            systems. The project clearly demonstrated that partnership\n            with NGOs in Nepal enabled agricultural productivity\n            improvements in remote locations where the poorest rural\n            communities are located. Greater attention should be given\n            to monitoring and evaluation to ensure informed policy\n            making and decision making. In Nepal the scope of data\n            collection and storage of data on agricultural input and\n            output performance information significantly contracted\n            during the transition from public to private service provision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Irrigation Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Irrigation Sector

- Irrigation Sector Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the Irrigation Sector\n            Project for Nepal were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was unlikely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned indicate the implementation experience of Nepal\n            Irrigation Sector Project (NISP) has shown that in Nepal it\n            is not administratively advisable to include a stand-alone\n            investment, such as Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project\n            (SMIP), as part of a sector program. For complex design\n            projects, financial management arrangements at least, have\n            to be made simple during the design stage. The failure of\n            the Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research and\n            Extension Project (DOA/AREP) to deliver improved\n            agricultural extension services to Farmer-Managed Irrigation\n            Scheme (FMIS) supported under NISP, has clearly demonstrated\n            the risks associated with relying on separate initiatives to\n            provide services needed for component implementation,\n            especially where close coordination and proper integration\n            between the components are needed. Considerable difficulties\n            remain with regards to the structure and operation of WUA on\n            publicly managed schemes like SMIP. The identification and\n            screening of FMIS for improvement and rehabilitation is a\n            difficult process that requires the use of an objective\n            transparent process, such as those developed under the\n            project. FMIS canals in the hills have been found vulnerable\n            to frequent natural disasters. The experience of M&E in\n            SMIP compared to the FMIS sub-component demonstrated that it\n            is not possible to carry out effective M&E unless clear\n            indications are provided as to how it will be funded, and\n            how it will be undertaken. In sector-wide projects like NISP\n            it is very important that the position of Project\n            Coordinator is filled by a senior experienced officer, and\n            that he or she is kept in post for as long as possible. The\n            full benefit from improvement and rehabilitation of FMIS is\n            only achieved when the investment made includes the\n            provision of technical advice on agriculture and water\n            management, as well as the construction of civil works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Irrigation Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Irrigation Sector
