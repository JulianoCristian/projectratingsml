Despite the\n            satisfactory performance by the Bank, given a demonstrated\n            pragmatism, and flexibility in recovering from serious\n            set-backs, the performance by the Borrower is rated\n            unsatisfactory, based on significant delays, failure to\n            complete the cadastral survey with costs seriously\n            underestimated, and, procurement problems. Although several\n            lessons are country-specific, reflecting the unique\n            circumstances of Paraguay's emergence from a long-term\n            dictatorship, and its continuing, slow transformation to\n            democracy, particularly evident in its institutional\n            framework, other significant lessons address the following.\n            Institutional development in project implementation needs to\n            be emphasized, not only addressing perceived weaknesses, but\n            by undertaking a significant economic reform, an issue which\n            given the country's conservative approach is deemed\n            difficult, aggravated by the highly-politicized civil\n            service. Detailed attention should be paid to institutions\n            whose cooperation is required for a project's success,\n            but which are not implementing agencies, and, the\n            establishment of inter-institutional agreements should be\n            based on the mutual understanding of the benefits to be\n            derived. Most important, in procurement, the use of works\n            criteria was largely preferred, rather than the use of\n            consulting services criteria, because it reduced the scope\n            for subjectivity, as well as the room for interpretation, a\n            fact demonstrated with the procurement of orthophoto\n            mapping, and cadastral surveying."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Land Use Rationalization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Land Use\n            Rationalization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1552043/paraguay-land-use-rationalization-project","projn":"PY-Land Use Rationalization Project -- P007911","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Wetlands,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Information Technology,General Technology,Earth Sciences & GIS","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Paraguay","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_0108110400356"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aerial photographs,aerial\n            photography,agricultural\n            development,Agriculture,basic,boundaries,cad,channel,climate,computer\n            hardware,dams,data\n            collection,earth,equipment,erosion,extension,farmers,field\n            work,flooding,Geodesy,Geographic\n            Information,Geophysics,GIS,images,imaging,integration,land\n            areas,Land Use,Mapping,marketing,modem,Modernization,Natural\n            Resources Management,new technology,point,printing,Quality\n            Assurance,quality control,radar,rural development,satellite\n            imagery,soil,Soil Science,soil scientists,soil\n            surveys,soils,statistical sampling,surveying,Technical\n            Assistance,technical expertise,thematic mapping,tropical\n            soils,vegetation,Western Hemisphere"},"1":{"cdata!":"aerial photographs,aerial\n            photography,agricultural\n            development,Agriculture,basic,boundaries,cad,channel,climate,computer\n            hardware,dams,data\n            collection,earth,equipment,erosion,extension,farmers,field\n            work,flooding,Geodesy,Geographic\n            Information,Geophysics,GIS,images,imaging,integration,land\n            areas,Land Use,Mapping,marketing,modem,Modernization,Natural\n            Resources Management,new technology,point,printing,Quality\n            Assurance,quality control,radar,rural development,satellite\n            imagery,soil,Soil Science,soil scientists,soil\n            surveys,soils,statistical sampling,surveying,Technical\n            Assistance,technical expertise,thematic mapping,tropical\n            soils,vegetation,Western Hemisphere"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development Dept (LCSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF020615-PHRD-NATURAL RESOURCE MGMT.

(b) the\n            establishment of a Geographic Information System as the\n            basis for an economic land use classification and its\n            associated legal and policy studies; (c) a program of\n            studies, including:  (i) institutional analysis of the\n            agricultural sector, and formulation of recommendations for\n            change; (ii) analysis of the existing system of land\n            titling, with recommendations for change based on the new\n            cadastre; (iii) analysis of policy affecting land use\n            practices, and recommendations for change;
