Ratings for the Land\n            Administration Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome\n            was unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. Ratings for the\n            Land Fund Project for Guatemala are as follows: outcome was\n            moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            significant, Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was also moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons learned include: the assessed projects make\n            assertions about enhanced tenure security, increased credit\n            access and reduced conflict over land rights but provided no\n            evidence to back these claims up. There is a literature\n            outside the Bank challenging these assumptions and the Bank\n            has only recently begun to take this into account. There are\n            a number of ways to measure tenure security and the progress\n            toward increasing it; and these measures need to be taken\n            into account in project design and monitored during\n            implementation. Summing up, security of land tenure is not\n            automatically boosted by land administration initiatives;\n            good land administration is a necessary (but not sufficient)\n            step toward secure land tenure. EI Salvador-with its single\n            agency-has made more progress toward technical integration\n            than Guatemala with its separate agencies. A unified agency\n            is preferred, if it can be politically established. If a\n            unified agency is not politically feasible, effective\n            arrangements for data integration must be introduced,\n            otherwise the unsatisfactory experience of Guatemala will be\n            repeated in other places. There are steps that can be taken\n            during project design and implementation to make it more\n            likely that integration will be effective. Regularization\n            may be more urgent, more feasible and more sustainable in\n            urban areas and in fertile rural areas with dynamic land\n            markets. Urban regularization could usefully be accompanied\n            by complementary efforts to improve municipal services,\n            municipal financing and slum upgrading. In rural areas,\n            there is more of a need to adopt an integrated approach to\n            land in private property, protected areas and indigenous\n            communities (the last two typically having been orphaned in\n            land administration projects)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -

Land Administration Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is highly likely;\n            institutional development impact is high; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            These lessons were cited: 1) Continuous high level support\n            is critical: it was critical that the Project quickly\n            delivered results (e.g., maps, cadastre, computerized\n            system, financial surplus) that would show its positive\n            social and economic impact to decision makers and\n            politicians. It was also key that the project could provide\n            timely and important information to decision makers in the\n            aftermath of the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, the 2001 earthquake\n            and the 2002 drought. Finally, the macroeconomic stability\n            that El Salvador has enjoyed during the last fifteen years\n            has created a favorable environment for Project\n            implementation. 2) The single land agency model is the\n            preferred option for land administration projects: This\n            model significantly improves the efficiency of registration\n            and the maintenance of updated information, thereby\n            increasing tenure security and, as a result, public support.\n            It greatly contributes to the financial sustainability and\n            profitability of land administration services. Further, the\n            integration of the cadastre, property, intellectual and\n            commercial registries contributes to an improved investment\n            climate in the country. Finally, it improves project\n            implementation. 3) Land records management through an\n            integrated cadastre-registry system has enormous potential\n            for supporting a growing and dynamic land market and an\n            effective and local revenue collection system. However,\n            tenure security through regularization alone does not spur\n            land investments and facilitate land access. Synergies and\n            sequencing with other sectors (e.g., judicial, rural\n            finance, decentralization) need to be supported and\n            maintained. 4) Broad and active involvement and\n            participation of major stakeholders is key for project\n            success. In particular, active communication toward and\n            participation by civil society are important to ensure the\n            quality of regularization work. Local governments also play\n            a very significant role 5) A pragmatic and incremental\n            approach to legal reforms is often the best approach. 6)\n            Automation and internet access to land records provides a\n            more efficient service and improved access to data and\n            information. 7) Pro-actively involving the private sector\n            through competitive contracting, as was done through the\n            Project with the surveying industry, can generate\n            substantial efficiency gains and cost savings. In fact, use\n            of the private sector and NGOs for land regularization\n            instead of force account for field work has proven to be\n            significantly more effective and efficient. 8) Strong\n            institutional reforms and clarification of responsibilities\n            are key for successful project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"El Salvador -
