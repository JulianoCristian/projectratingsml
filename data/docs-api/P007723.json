The three\n            projects addressed different, but important dimensions of\n            Mexico's transport sector, and, all three projects\n            largely achieved their objectives, despite significant\n            initial implementation problems in the case of the air\n            quality, and the highway projects. Three lessons emerge from\n            these operations. First, much progress can be achieved in\n            reducing the impact of road transport on air quality,\n            through a combination of public and private sector measures,\n            starting with an adequate system of incentives, put in place\n            by federal, and state governments. Second, allocation of\n            highway maintenance funding optimizes outcome, when\n            preference is given to routine, and periodic maintenance\n            over rehabilitation, but network condition is bound to\n            deteriorate if funding for rehabilitation is not made\n            available. Third, regarding infrastructure privatization\n            ,and in order to gain public acceptance, requires as\n            necessary (but not always sufficient) conditions, a\n            transparent privatization process, compliance with\n            commitments by private operators, and government provision\n            of social protection to users of non-commercial services,\n            and to staff made redundant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Transport Air Quality Management\n            for Mexico City, Highway Rehabilitation and Safety, and\n            Infrastructure Privatization Technical Assistance Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Transport Air Quality\n            Management for Mexico City, Highway Rehabilitation and\n            Safety, and Infrastructure Privatization Technical\n            Assistance Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2439807/mexico-transport-air-quality-management-mexico-city-highway-rehabilitation-safety-infrastructure-privatization-technical-assistance-projects","projn":"MX-Infra.

Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated satisfactory overall.\n            Lessons learned included the following: Although Mexico\n            suffered one of its most severe economic crises, the\n            Government decided to cut allocations for new construction\n            and thus concentrate funds available for maintenance of the\n            existing network--evidencing the Government's\n            commitment towards the project's objectives. The\n            project was fully satisfactory in introducing major changes\n            in institutional arrangements. These results were the\n            culmination of a long-term relationship between the Bank and\n            the country, with continuity of the Bank's staff\n            dedicated to Mexico, and enough time to prepare the project.\n            Planning for the use of resources should be based on\n            economic analysis that identifies the optimal choices of\n            road sections to be improved and the type of works to be\n            carried out, through the use of computerized road management\n            systems. Contracting of maintenance on a competitive basis\n            improves efficiency compared to force account operations; it\n            should be used for all routine maintenance and periodic\n            maintenance when there is sufficient knowledge regarding how\n            this can be done. A good design is important in a program\n            like this, in order to maximize the likelihood of a positive\n            output, and get sufficient experience to progressively\n            implement maintenance contracts based on performance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Highway Rehabilitation and Safety Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Highway Rehabilitation\n

         through investments in rehabilitation and resurfacing of\n            paved highways; (b) improve highway rehabilitation,\n            resurfacing and maintenance (HRRM) planning by strenghtening\n            the institutional capacity of the Secretariat for\n            Communications and Transport's (SCT's) highway\n            maintenance directorate; (c) support measures to improve\n            funding for HRRM; (d) reduce transport costs through\n            improvements in traffic safety and more efficient traffic\n            flow on the federal highways; and (e) support further policy\n            improvements through:  (i) studies on road financing; (ii)\n            development and implementation of a computerized data base\n            for the transport

The objectives will be achieved through the\n            implementation of: (a) an institutional strengthening\n            component for improving transport sector planning and\n            policies; (b) a comprehensive, four year HRRM program for\n            the federal highway system; and (c) a road traffic safety\n            program. The institutional strenghthening component will\n            include specific measures and actions to improve: (a) sector\n            planning and coordination, especially for HRRM; (b) HRRM\n            funding and budget preparation; (c) sustainability through\n            development of a coherent framework for road sector\n            financing; (d) control of truck overloading through the\n            issuance of revised vehicle weight and size regulations and\n            a program for their implementation; (e) specifications for\n            HRRM works, to include quarry management and pollution\n            control of construction equipment; (f) the system for truck\n            driver education, testing and licensing; and (g) training of\n            sector staff. The four-year HRRM program will include about\n            27,000 km of highway rehabilitation and resurfacing,\n            improvement and rehabilitation of bridges and depots\n            maintenance, replacement/rehabilitation of equipment, and\n            consultancy services.

         through investments in rehabilitation and resurfacing of\n            paved highways; (b) improve highway rehabilitation,\n            resurfacing and maintenance (HRRM) planning by strenghtening\n            the institutional capacity of the Secretariat for\n            Communications and Transport's (SCT's) highway\n            maintenance directorate; (c) support measures to improve\n            funding for HRRM; (d) reduce transport costs through\n            improvements in traffic safety and more efficient traffic\n            flow on the federal highways; and (e) support further policy\n            improvements through:  (i) studies on road financing; (ii)\n            development and implementation of a computerized data base\n            for the transport sector; (iii) preparation of project\n            planning and evaluation manuals; and (iv) improved\n            consideration of environmental factors in highway\n            maintenance. The objectives will be achieved through the\n            implementation of: (a) an institutional strengthening\n            component for improving transport sector planning and\n            policies; (b) a comprehensive, four year HRRM program for\n            the federal highway system; and (c) a road traffic safety\n            program. The institutional strenghthening component will\n            include specific measures and actions to improve: (a) sector\n            planning and coordination, especially for HRRM; (b) HRRM\n            funding and budget preparation; (c) sustainability through\n            development of a coherent framework for road sector\n            financing; (d) control of truck overloading through the\n            issuance of revised vehicle weight and size regulations and\n            a program for their implementation; (e) specifications for\n            HRRM works, to include quarry management and pollution\n            control of construction equipment; (f) the system for truck\n            driver education, testing and licensing; and (g) training of\n            sector staff. The four-year HRRM program will include about\n            27,000 km of highway rehabilitation and resurfacing,\n            improvement and rehabilitation of bridges and depots\n            maintenance, replacement/rehabilitation of equipment, and\n            consultancy services. The road traffic safety program will\n            include improvement of some 350 hazardous road locations. It\n            will also finance the purchase of equipment for the new\n            licensing and vehicle inspection system and for the\n            preventive medical unit, road safety studies and information\n            campaigns, a vehicle standards study and an international\n            traffic safety seminar."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
