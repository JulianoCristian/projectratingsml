Some lessons learned included: fighting and\n            preventing HIV/AIDS is fundamental to the economic and\n            social development of a country. Therefore, regardless of\n            income level, governments should not rely only on donor\n            resources which are characterized by unpredictability and\n            uncertainty. It is necessary to clarify the institutional\n            setting at the design stage to avoid dual oversight and to\n            make sure that only one structure is accountable for project\n            execution. Technical assistance for project execution and\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) should be embedded in\n            this type of project, especially when national capacities\n            are known to be weak. The technical assistance package\n            should be flexible enough so that it can be redeployed to\n            help address emerging challenges, as the implementation\n            unfolds. For instance, technical assistance for M&E is\n            essential to fine tune results framework, collect data,\n            compare them and use them to better inform policies and\n            strategies. The success of complex, multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS\n            projects in very low capacity environments is likely to be\n            due to the commitment and competence of one or a few\n            exceptional individuals. Since such individuals are\n            typically few and far between, it makes such projects very\n            risky. Furthermore, since the Bank has no mechanism to\n            ensure that such individuals are found and hired, it is\n            difficult to see how appropriate mitigation measures can be developed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Multi-Sectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Multi-Sectoral\n            STI/HIV/AIDS Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/12/11650347/niger-multi-sectoral-stihivaids-support-project","projn":"NE-Multi-Sector Sti/Hiv/Aids Support Project\n            -- P071612","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Adolescent Health,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,HIV AIDS","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Niger","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100113233224"},"theme":"HIV/AIDS,Vulnerability assessment and monitoring,Population and reproductive health,Participation and civic engagement,Health system performance","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to treatment,acute respiratory\n            infections,advocacy work,affected communities,aged,AIDS\n            Campaign,AIDS control,AIDS orphans,AIDS\n            Surveillance,analytical process,available data,behavior\n            change,beneficiary assessment,births,blood donors,blood\n            safety,blood screening,capacity building,Care,child\n            health,child health services,civil society,commercial\n            sex,commercial sex workers,communicable diseases,community\n            level,condom promotion,condoms,contraceptives,cost\n            effectiveness,country context,Currency Unit,Development\n            Goals,development work,drugs,early marriage,Economic\n            Analysis,economic growth,effective\n            prevention,emigration,Epidemiological\n            situation,epidemiological study,epidemiological\n            surveillance,epidemiology,Exchange\n            Rate,exercises,Expenditures,families,family planning,food\n            needs,geographical areas,geographical coverage,girls,health\n            facilities,health indicators,health sector,Health\n            workers,high risk behaviors,high risk\n            groups,high-risk,high-risk populations,HIV,HIV infection,HIV\n            positive,HIV transmission,hospitals,Human\n            Development,hygiene,impact indicators,implementation\n            plan,improved access,improved environment,income,income\n            generation,infant mortality,Institutional\n            Analysis,institutional framework,intervention,laboratory\n            services,lending program,life expectancy,living\n            conditions,local conditions,local level,local levels,low\n            prevalence,macroeconomic framework,malaria,migrant\n            workers,morbidity,mortality,Mother-to-child,Mother-to-child\n            transmission,mothers,Multi-Country AIDS,national\n            health,national levels,national policy,new cases,nutritional\n            status,parasitic infections,Partnership,patients,political\n            commitment,poverty alleviation,poverty reduction,poverty\n            reduction strategy,pregnant women,prevalence\n            survey,prevention of mother,prevention of mother-to-child\n            transmission,preventive activities,preventive\n            strategies,primary health care,private sector,productive\n            sectors,prostitutes,prostitution,public health,public\n            sector,Regional disparities,religious beliefs,religious\n            organizations,reproductive age,reproductive\n            health,reproductive health services,risk behaviors,risk\n            groups,rural areas,safety,screening,service delivery,sex,sex\n            education,sex workers,sexual encounter,sexuality,social\n            assistance,Social Development,social indicators,social\n            services,social support,STIs,street\n            children,syphilis,technical assistance,technical\n            nature,technical support,traditional practices,traditional\n            practitioners,treatment,UNAIDS,urban areas,use of\n            condoms,Vaccination,vaccines,victims,Voluntary\n            counseling,voluntary testing,vulnerable\n            groups,waste,widows,workers,World Health Organization,young\n            boys,young girls,young women,youthAcquired Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome;

mainly concerned\n            with reducing the risk of infection posed by biomedical\n            waste collection, storage, and disposal in connection with\n            this project. The two types of waste health care facilities\n            would produce are solid waste such as that produced by\n            health care providers diagnosing and treating patients as\n            well as ordinary garbage, and liquid waste derived from\n            blood and toxic/hazardous chemicals, along with laboratory\n            research and pharmaceutical waste products, and waste\n            products resulting from surgery, for example, anatomical\n            waste, disinfectants, mercury compounds, x-ray films,\n            syringes, tubes, other instruments, and used bandages. Solid\n            waste comprises the main category of wastes that poses the\n            risk of transmission of Hepatitis B or C and/or HIV/AIDS,\n            especially through sharps, syringes, and other cutting\n            instruments, and is the main focus of this assessment. The\n            report also identifies the risk of air pollution due to the\n            release of hydrochloric acid, and silver and sulfuric oxides\n            as well as carcinogenic particle emissions. Incinerating\n            plastic also raises the risk of toxic gas release. Surface\n            and underground water could be polluted by runoff from these\n            biomedical wastes. Measures to mitigate the risk of\n            contamination include: Building the institutional capacity\n            of hospitals, health centers, and health agencies; equipping\n            health facilities and personnel involved in waste disposal\n            with protective gear (masks and gowns) and equipment;\n            providing health facilities with suitable collection bins\n            for storing biomedical waste; providing disinfectant\n            (bleach) to sterilize needles and \"sharps\"\n            (instruments); and providing health facilities with mobile\n            equipment (carts and wheelbarrows) to aid in removing waste;\n            and building incinerators. Waste management activities will\n            involve the private sector and members of civil society.\n            Efforts will be made to disseminate information through the\n            media, and to train personnel and others exposed to\n            infectious diseases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care Project\n            : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Projet d\u2019appui au programme\n            multisectoriel de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA au Niger :\n            \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/12/2047960/niger-hivaids-prevention-care-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"NE-Multi-Sector Sti/Hiv/Aids Support Project\n            -- P071612","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Niger","authors":{"authr":"Ibrahim, Faria"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02110604072872"},"subsc":"Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Disease transmission; Environmental\n            mitigation; HIV infections; Acquired Immune Deficiency\n            Syndrome; Biomedical chemicals; Biomedical materials; Body\n            fluids; Contaminants; Hazardous waste burning; Hazardous\n            waste disposal; Hazardous waste sites; Hazardous waste\n            transport; Hazardous waste sites cleanup; Toxic waste\n            disposal; Laboratory animals; Solid waste disposal;\n            Disinfection; Bleaching; Medical apparatus; Medical care;\n            Medical instruments; Medical laboratory equipment; Medical\n            personnel protection; Medical practice; Medical wastes;\n            Pharmaceuticals; Hepatitis viruses; Surgical equipment;\n            Underground water pollution; Surface water runoff; Wounds\n            & injuries; Hydrochloric acid; Carcinogens;\n            Institutional capacity; Medical research personnel; Staff\n            training; Information dissemination; Nongovernmental\n            organizations; Waste disposal in ground; Incineration\n            environmental aspects"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026716-PHRD-NIGER: HIV/AIDS PREVENTION\n            AND CARE","repnb":"E637","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Projet d'appui au Programme\n            Multisectoriel de Lutte contre le VIH/SIDA au Niger- gestion\n            des dechets issus des soins de sante - plan de gestion\n            environnementale des DISS"}}},"facets":{}}}
