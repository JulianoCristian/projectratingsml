Some lessons learned included: 1) The use of\n            an adaptable program loan (APL) provided flexibility to the\n            Government to move ahead quickly with the second phase of\n            their 10-year education strategy, move some activities to\n            the second phase, and to improve areas such as monitoring\n            and evaluation, and involve teachers and unions in the\n            design of pedagogic reforms; 2) Monitoring and evaluation\n            systems should be aligned with reform programs allowing the\n            monitoring of reform implementation and the development of\n            evidenced-based policy decision-making; 3) In managing\n            education sector reforms, involving stakeholders at key\n            points of the design, implementation and evaluation of\n            reforms helps build their commitment to reform programs and\n            ensures that planned activities are able to be implemented\n            sequentially. This is especially relevant for reforms where\n            stakeholders are involved or responsible for implementation;\n            4) Major pedagogic reforms such as the introduction of a\n            competency-based approach aims to change significantly the\n            approach and behavior of teachers in classrooms; and 5) The\n            preparation of new projects in Tunisia must have prior\n            discussion with the National Tender Board to apprise them of\n            the procurement procedures that will be agreed upon in the\n            Loan
