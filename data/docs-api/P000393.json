The lessons learned indicate that a good\n            combined effort by the IDA macro-economic and transport\n            sector teams and a real dialogue with the Government,\n            leading to firm commitments from the latter, can make\n            possible the undertaking of vast reform programs. More\n            specifically, the complementary relationship between the\n            adjustment and investment lending can ensure the success of\n            sector wide reforms. The Bank needs to coordinate all its\n            support and insure that the Government will not design\n            conflicting schedules in strategies implementation: the\n            rural roads strategy, for example, has not been rendered\n            sustainable so far because it interfered with much broader\n            decentralization issues that could not be dealt with at a\n            pace compatible with the project.

These objectives will be\n            achieved by: 1) state divestiture from transport operations\n            in favor of a greater involvement of private operators, and\n            institutions more focused on planning, regulation and\n            definition of sector policies; 2) better balance in resource\n            allocation between prudent investments and maintenance\n            expenditures, and sustainable resource mobilization; 3)\n            improved regulatory framework resulting in more\n            liberalization, increased competitiveness and more\n            competition; and 4) development and implementation of a\n            sector policy to protect the environment. The project\n            comprises the following components: 1) civil works on paved\n            roads, unpaved roads, rural roads, port, and the rail and\n            air transports; 2) goods; and 3) technical assistance and\n            training. More specifically, the project will consist of: 1)\n            execution of a three-year time-slice of the road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance program and bridge\n            maintenance program on primary roads of the priority\n            network; 2) execution of a rural transport infrastructure\n            maintenance program; 3) construction of two weighing\n            stations; 4) purchase of data processing supplies and\n            equipment of related offices; 5) provision of technical\n            assistance and consulting services; 6) training; and 7)\n
