Some lessons learned includes: the monitoring\n            indicator must be tailored with cause and effect relations\n            between the project interventions and the indicators.\n            Monitoring indicator selection and target-value setting are\n            critical to measure the effectiveness of project\n            interventions. Inadequate indicators distort the performance\n            results and lower the confidence on evaluation system. When\n            project interventions merely focus on civil works, freight /\n            passenger tariffs and commodities prices should be\n            cautiously used as project indicators unless their\n            correlation with the project interventions is clearly\n            identified and the risk of policy and market fluctuations is\n            considered since they may be affected by external factors\n            other than the project interventions. As experienced in this\n            project, fuel and labor price rose rapidly and a global\n            economic crisis was encountered, which had dominant\n            influence on transport price rather than that of road\n            condition improvements. Similarly, many factors may\n            contribute to traffic safety. It is necessary to conduct\n            quantitative impact evaluation and/or economic analysis to\n            isolate the impacts of project investments from the effects\n            of other exogenous factors that are expected to increase or\n            decrease substantially during project implementation. To\n            avoid major technical changes and environmental impacts, it\n            is critical to control the quality of feasibility study and\n            optimize engineering designs at project preparation stage.\n            Both time and fund for project preparation and\n            implementation should be adequately considered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Anhui Highway

and\n            Improvement Project for China aims to increase the effective\n            use of the road infrastructure in the Anhui Province to\n            support its social and economic development, as evidenced by\n            the increase in the flows of passenger and freight traffic\n            along key corridors across the province at lower costs and\n            with improved safety. The project will include the following\n            components: (i) road rehabilitation will support the\n            provincial rehabilitation and maintenance program from\n            2007-2010 under the Eleventh Five Year Program (EFYP). The\n            Bank contribution will help finance eligible investments\n            under the rehabilitation component of the program. A list of\n            18 segments to be rehabilitated, for about 890 km, has been\n            evaluated and found acceptable in the context of the\n            province-wide program of the road network rehabilitation;\n            (ii) road improvement or upgrading of about 320 km of key\n            provincial and national roads located on the Central-Eastern\n            and Southeastern areas of the Province. These improvements\n            or upgrades will include in some cases the duplication of\n            existing roads following the same alignment with specific\n            bypasses in built-up areas (in order to minimize\n            resettlement actions) or with short segments of new\n            alignments if necessary to avoid difficult topographical\n            conditions; (iii) road maintenance by contract Anhui\n            Provincial Communications Department (APCD) will implement\n            maintenance by contract approach in at least two highway\n            segments of the provincial highway network for a cumulative\n            number of 120 kilometers by the end of the project; and (iv)\n            institutional strengthening program includes the provision\n            of improved tools for road management (technical,\n            environmental, and economic) and a training program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Anhui Highway Rehabilitation and\n
