The lessons learned show\n            that for project design, indicators are important to assess\n            progress at all levels. Special attention is needed to\n            institutional capacity issues to ensure smooth\n            implementation. Coordination of multi-funding agencies: more\n            manageable for government than separate projects, clear\n            principles for donor coordination need to be established at\n            onset; harmonization of fund channeling, procurement, and\n            reporting arrangements would help a lot, especially in\n            places of limited capacities; pooling of various funds for\n            some projects can simplify implementation. Project design\n            should allow the flexibility to adapt to changing\n            circumstances - economic, financial, social context\n            (restructuring); the capacity of the government to provide\n            adequate counterpart funding needs to be assured, and\n            realistic \"disbursement ratios\" are vital. Project\n            Implementation : need for capacity building across all\n            involved government agencies - example of Ministry of Works\n            - design, procurement, supervision/monitoring and evaluation\n            capacity. Private sector tendering for construction (and\n            design / supervision) appears more efficient and cost\n            effective. Government financial management needs to be\n            streamlined - especially the approval process, and\n            delegation of signing authority to minimize delays in\n            project payments. The availability and continuity of\n            appropriate counterpart staff is critical to the success of\n            a project, and lack of availability and continuity of\n            counterpart staff is a significant contributor to the poor\n            performance of projects. Simplified procurement arrangements\n            and adequate supervision of contractors and consultants are\n            important for effective implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea -

A program approach has been adopted\n            which will: (1) develop the institutional capacity to foster\n            and manage a comprehensive population program; (2) deliver\n            effective family planning services; (3) generate an\n            increased demand for family planning; and (4) mobilize\n            public awareness and support for the program through\n            government and non-government channels. The project will\n            significantly contribute to improvements in female\n            reproductive health, thus female health in general. The\n            legitimacy of family planning will be strongly enhanced\n            leading to overall improvement in the social welfare of the\n            current generation and ultimately to macro-economic and\n            environmental benefits from moderated population growth.\n            While government policy aims to provide better family\n            planning services nationwide, in the initial phases program\n            strategy will direct efforts to areas of highest population\n            density. Improved family planning services will be fostered\n            through: (a) provision of improved facilities for family\n            planning delivery and counselling, including appropriately\n            equipping the facilities; (b) operational support for\n            management and supervision; (c) staff training in clinical\n            and communication skills; and (d) incremental staffing. The\n            provision of family planning services and the overall\n            population program will be supported through: (i) improved\n            logistics and contraceptive supplies; (ii) enhancement of\n            nongovernment organizations capabilities in this sector;\n            (iii) development of a health promotion center; (iv)\n            population and family planning research; (v) improved\n            collection of demographic data including a demographic\n            health survey in 1995; and (vi) management and program\n            monitoring and evaluation activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Population and Family\n            Planning Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Papua New Guinea - Population and\n            Family
