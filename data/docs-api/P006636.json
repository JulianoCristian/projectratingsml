The key\n            lessons suggest that even though, adaptive research is an\n            essential, and continuous need for small farmers'\n            competitiveness, it may turn against them, as in this case,\n            because the environment where small farmers operate, is also\n            that where large-scale, entrepreneurial, and most\n            importantly, export-oriented larger farmers, and\n            agro-industries operate, de-facto, a barrier to small\n            farmers' success. Furthermore, while creditworthiness,\n            and technology transfer are necessary to increase\n            productivity, these alone, are not sufficient to guarantee\n            income increases; instead, the sum of other factors, such as\n            infrastructure, marketing, and farmer organizations\n            development, could prod an open environment competitiveness\n            in farming development.
