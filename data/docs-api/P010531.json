This operation was one of\n            the few nationwide health projects in India, and therefore\n            did not benefit from extensive prior experience, and the\n            problems and risks encountered were due to the enormous size\n            and complexity of the country. The Bank should focus\n            attention increasingly on the poor performing states.\n            Moreover, the Bank may have overestimated the capacity of\n            the sector, or substantially underestimated the efforts\n            needed to engage effectively nationwide efforts, especially\n            with the empowered action group (EAG) states to bring them\n            to par. This is reflected in the overall project design and\n            relative budget allocation for supervision, which was\n            similar to less complex Bank investment operations. The RCH\n            project was centrally designed and controlled, a perception\n            that remained throughout the life of the project, and was\n            reinforced by the approach used in implementing the\n            components. While the Mid-Term Review (MTR) attempted to\n            correct this by restructuring financial, training and\n            managerial responsibilities, it was not enough. The\n            resulting limited state ownership, and commitment for\n            results affected project performance in key areas. Thus it\n            is reinforced that State ownership, capacity and governance\n            are key to the success of any project in India, particularly\n            in the EAG states. Other lessons address the value of\n            partnership and coordination cannot be overstated,\n            especially in a large, complex country as India, where no\n            single agency can do it all, and attribution of success must\n            be shared; that stronger emphasis is required on Information\n            Education and Communication (IEC), targeting both\n            communities, and providers; and, that for successful project\n            implementation, management capacities of the Department of\n            Family Welfare (DOHFW) should be strengthened, and the Bank\n            should ensure the availability of more resources for\n            effective supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Reproductive and Child Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Reproductive and Child\n            Health Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/05/5843176/india-reproductive-child-health-project","projn":"IN-Reproductive And Child Health Project -- P010531","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Educational Sciences,Housing & Human Habitats,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Education","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050606101021"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adolescents, advertisements, Antenatal Care,\n            authorization, Central government, Central government\n            administration, Child Development, Cities, citizens, civic\n            engagement, communities, community health, community\n            participation, data collection, decentralization,\n            decision-making, districts, Equipment, Exchange Rate,\n            expenditure, Family Planning, financial incentives,\n            financial management, Financial rate of return, financial\n            systems, FISCAL, Folic Acid, foreign assistance, Gender,\n            health care, Health Indicators, health outcomes, health\n            services, Households, human resource, human resource\n            management, immunization, Immunodeficiency, informed\n            consent, innovation, innovations, institutional capacity,\n            Institutional Development, Institutionalization,\n            integration, intervention, Intrauterine Devices, Iron, IUDs,\n            lack of ownership, Literacy, local government, local\n            government authorities, managers, mass media, Measles,\n            morbidity, Mortality, National level, Nations, Needs\n            Assessment, NGOs, Nurses, Partnership, polio, Pregnancy,\n            private sector, private sector participation, programs,\n            Public Institutions, public sector, radio, rationalization,\n            research results, rural areas, Rural Development, sexuality,\n            slums, state participation, sterilization, STIs, teachers,\n            TOT, training activities, Training Institutes, training\n            materials, urban areas, workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
