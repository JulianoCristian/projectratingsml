Some\n            of the lessons learned included: 1) Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E). Although data is necessarily\n            qualitative in this kind of project, it should be\n            systematically organized to avoid the anecdotal. The Second\n            Palestinian NGO Project (PNGOII) was unable to produce\n            baseline data across all components inhibiting any\n            measurement of development outcomes. More attention to\n            participatory approaches to needs assessment, planning\n            implementation and monitoring should allow baseline data\n            collection to be incorporated in monitoring system design.\n            Nonetheless, it is acknowledged that the working environment\n            will probably continue to be subject to security-related\n            interruptions and delays that force project designers to\n            move ahead without data collection in some cases; 2) Variety\n            in Grant types. Although PNGOII had rather a multiplicity of\n            grant types, it clearly demonstrated the need for different\n            categories. The Partnership Grants paired experienced NGOs\n            operating at a national level with small community based\n            organizations and provided a model for knowledge transfer.\n            It also developed long lasting collaborative partnerships\n            among NGOs in an environment where competition among NGOs is\n            rife. The Emergency Grants demonstrated the value of drawing\n            rapid donor funds to emerging needs; 3) Capacity-Building.\n            This takes time especially in conflict-affected or unstable\n            contexts, and the Bank's commitment to the NGO sector\n            by remaining engaged through a series of projects was\n            critical, although PNGOII was just one of a sequence of\n            projects whose long-term outcome is yet to be measured.\n            Capacity building occurred indirectly through the experience\n            of implementing sub-grants or directly through the\n            components designed to 'teach' skills; and 4)\n            Looking Forward to PNGOIII. Strategic development in the\n            grant components took a back seat to achieving success in\n            the provision of services and creation of a network of NGOs\n            and Community-based organizations all the way to the final\n            beneficiaries. Under any successor projects, it will be\n            important for the relative responsibilities of NGO\n            Development Centers Board and staff to be fully and clearly\n            documented and followed. This should lead to improved\n            awareness of the need for strategic thinking and development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - The Second Palestinian\n            NGO Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - The Second\n            Palestinian NGO Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/04/7585774/west-bank-gaza-second-palestinian-ngo-project","projn":"GZ-The Palestinian Ngo Project (Ii) -- P071040","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Social Accountability,Development Economics & Aid Effectiveness","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Social Development,Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development","count":"West Bank and Gaza","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000310607_20070504153443"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Social Development,Poverty Reduction,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actions, advocacy, auditors, audits, Bank\n            Ratings, basic health service, beneficiaries, best\n            practices, capacity building, CBO, civic engagement, civil\n            society, Code of Ethics, community participation, data\n            collection, development assistance, development cooperation,\n            Development Objectives, development process, disadvantaged\n            people, employment, Environmental Objectives, Financial\n            Management, flexibility, gaps, gender analysis, good\n            governance, Governmental Organization, Governmental\n            Organizations, ICR, Impact Assessment, impact evaluation,\n            Implementation Completion Report, Improvements,\n            institutional capacity, institutional change, institutional\n            development, institutional framework, institutional\n            strengthening, insurance, International Development,\n            interviews, Key performance indicators, labor markets,\n            learning, local government, M&amp;E arrangements,\n            M&amp;E Design, marginalized groups, Middle East,\n            Monitoring &amp; Evaluation, monitoring data, NGO, North\n            Africa, Operations, organizational capacity, Outreach,\n            participatory approaches, participatory monitoring,\n            performance indicators, Poverty Impacts, Preparation,\n            priorities, programs, project beneficiaries, Project Design,\n            project evaluation, project implementation, Project\n            Management, public services, qualitative data, Quality at\n            Entry, quality of services, reconstruction, reflection,\n            service delivery, service providers, Social Development,\n            social services, Stakeholder, Stakeholder Workshop,\n            stakeholders, success indicators, Supervision,\n            sustainability, Sustainable Development, target group,\n            targeting, Technical Assistance, working conditions"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development (MNSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF029798-SECOND PALESTINIAN NGO PROJECT,TF050275-ITALIAN COF.
