Some lessons learned included: the\n            underestimation of the difficulties and risks related to\n            privatization had a significant impact on project\n            implementation. While there was broad agreement on the\n            overall privatization scheme, there was insufficient\n            appreciation and consensus on among other issues, the\n            tariff, and the duration and exclusiveness conditions of the\n            concession agreement. Moreover, even after the agreement had\n            been signed, disagreements persisted about the timing and\n            size of investments, source and cost of finance/loans,\n            tariffs, earnings and efficiency/performance standards. The\n            project suffered from an unrealistic timeframe for the\n            implementation of the legal and regulatory reform. The\n            implementation of the regulatory framework and entity was\n            crucial for the success of this power/water project, but was\n            designed and supported under a different International\n            Development Association (IDA)-financed project, which\n            created some difficulties during implementation. Putting in\n            place robust and realistic tariff adjustment mechanisms is\n            still essential for the viability of the power and water\n            sectors. The issue of affordability, for the poorest\n            consumers, has been a significant one at several points in\n            the implementation of this project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde -
