Some lessons learned includes: the\n            joint co-financing arrangement has been challenged by the\n            slow flow of counterpart funding for payment certificates\n            for works executed by contractors and consultants. The\n            project initially sought to reestablish basic transports\n            services in the areas that came out of a protracted civil\n            war, through spot improvement and maintenance of the\n            existing roads. Capacity of the implementing entities was\n            weak and Technical Assistance (TA) was sought in critical\n            areas. However, the institutions were reluctant to have TA.\n            Proactive project management is necessary to respond to\n            changing circumstances. The design of the NETREP was\n            substantially modified during implementation to take into\n            account the changing situation. NETREP was designed to\n            address sectorial challenges in a single operation within a\n            short period of time. Despite difficult situation in post\n            conflict environment where many things are uncertain and\n            risks to Project Development Objective (PDO) were high, the\n            Bank's decision to quickly respond to the\n            country's immediate challenges, and thus taking risks\n            to help, is commendable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - National Emergency Transport\n

The changes involve: a)\n            an extension of the project closing to complete the on-going\n            road project which is stalled due to insecurity situation in\n            the Blue Nile State; b) reallocation within and among\n            components to: 1) avail funds to institutional development\n            to continue with the capacity building activities; 2)\n            provide additional funding to supervision services to cover\n            the increased cost of supervision, during the extended\n            period of roads contracts execution; and 3) allocate the\n            balance of the Multi Donor Trust Fund for Sudan National\n            Secretariat (MDTF-NS) allocation for the first section of\n            the Damazin-Kurmuk road to the second section of the\n            Damazin- Kurmuk road contract to cover additional financing\n            requirements due to the insecurity, increase in quantities\n            of existing bill items and escalation of prices; c) drop\n            activities that will not be implemented under the NETRP; and\n            d) revision of targets to reflect the changes. The closing\n            date of the project will be extended to June 30, 2013, to\n            allow the completion of ongoing contracts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - National Emergency Transport\n            Rehabilitation Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan -
