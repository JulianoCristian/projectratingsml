Some\n            lessons learned included: emergency response operations\n            require balancing and trading off between speed in response,\n            cost of interventions, and quality of interventions. The\n            integration of citizen engagement mechanisms at the sector\n            and project levels can strengthen the effectiveness of key\n            municipal services by: (i) improving information flows\n            between service providers and citizens; (ii) introducing\n            communication channels that will facilitate citizen\n            feedback. The follow-up RMIDP II could serve as a pilot for\n            the integration of CE mechanisms into key municipal\n            services, notably water and sanitation, and local roads.\n            Importance of ensuring that investments takes place within a\n            strategic vision that is in place. While it is common\n            practice to construct WWTPs in several countries without\n            having first a wastewater management strategy design and\n            adopted, the case of Georgia showed the benefits of having a\n            strategy in place first. The strategy not only introduced\n            more cost-effective technology options, but also encouraged\n            donor organizations, such as SIDA, to commit resources and\n            invest in the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Regional and Municipal\n            Infrastructure Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Regional and Municipal\n
