Lessons\n            learned includes: 1) the project was designed by an outgoing\n            Government, and began to be implemented by a new Government\n            only two months later. The program design was not consistent\n            with the structure and goals of the incoming Government. It\n            is clear from this experience that projects suffer when they\n            are designed under one Government and executed under a\n            subsequent one whose structure and priorities are distinctly\n            different;  2) the project design did not adequately address\n            what was meant by a \"consultant\", and ended up\n            supporting far too many Government line positions as\n            consultants. When the funding ended these people left and\n            the Government was weakened by their departure; and 3) the\n            project design did not adequately address the issue of how\n            taxes were to be paid for by the Government, and what steps\n            would be taken if the Government was unable to meet their\n            tax liabilities. Similar problems arose with counterpart\n            funds. The lesson is that solutions to these possible issues\n            should be more clearly thought through before a project begins."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Environmental Technical Assistance\n            Project (ETAP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia -
