this project. The project also aims to\n            strengthen TCZB as an agricultural banking institution.\n            Specific components to be financed by the project are: (i)\n            on-farm development loans; (ii) crop and fallow-reduction\n            schemes; (iii) irrigation and crop production; and (iv)\n            strengthening of TCZB. The main benefits resulting from the\n            project would be improved agricultural productivity and\n            higher farm income in areas where the Government has\n            undertaken to intensify extension and other support services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Second Agricultural Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Second Agricultural\n            Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/05/725364/turkey-second-agricultural-credit-project","projn":"TR-Agric.
