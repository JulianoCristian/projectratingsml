The\n            primary objective of the project was to improve the earning\n            ability of Burundi coffee, the country's principal\n            export crop. Although the project had a good start,\n            implementation of the institutional reform program was\n            delayed by one year owing to political resistance within the\n            Government. The Bank's performance can be assessed as\n            marginally satisfactory. The performance of the Borrower was\n            generally satisfactory particularly with regard to adhering\n            to the covenants of the Credit Agreement. The overall\n            outcome of the project could be considered as marginally\n            satisfactory. It achieved a number of institutional\n            restructuring and development objectives including a\n            substantial increase in the proportion of fully washed\n            coffee for exports, resulting in increased export earnings.\n            Key lessons learned: (a) although this was not a stated\n            objective of the project, attention could have been given,\n            in the design of the project, to the organization of farmer\n            representation on the Board of the Office du Caf\u00e9 (OdC); (b)\n            The risk of overly bureaucratic behavior of the newly\n            created entities could have been avoided by introducing a\n            more competitive environment. (c) Project financed research\n            would have been more productive if, alongside the\n            traditional agricultural research, efforts had been directed\n            towards identifying and eliminating commercial constraints.\n            (d) The impact of the training program was affected by poor\n            selection of trainees resulting in a mismatch between\n            training needs of the individuals and the training offered.\n            However the lasting value of the training depends on\n            personnel stability. More stringent and clearer regulations\n            and selection criteria should have been adopted, especially\n            for the overseas training. (e) Utilization and the\n            management of the appropriate technical assistance not only\n            supports the project but works as a capacity building tool.\n            (f) If the coffee production is to be high in both quantity\n            and quality, training and extension should be integrated\n            into the sector and made its responsibility."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi -
