The DPC2 reinforces reform areas\n            supported by the First Development Policy Credit (DPC1) and\n            builds the earlier policy-based operations. The DPC2 is\n            aligned with World Bank's strategic directions set out\n            in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY11-14). The main\n            risks are: (a) aggregate demand pressures could linger\n            resulting in persistent rupee shortage. Mitigating factors\n            include: recent monetary and fiscal tightening; a\n            calibration of capital spending by the Royal Government of\n            Bhutan, or RGoB based on foreign grants or loans; and\n            commitment at high levels of the RGoB (in close coordination\n            between Ministry of Finance, the Royal Monetary Authority,\n            in consultation with the World Bank) to targets as evidenced\n            by quarterly review of macroeconomic performance. The\n            expansion of the existing line of credit with the Government\n            of India as well as the currency swap arrangement should\n            help ease pressures on the rupee; (b) capacity constraints\n            due to the small scale of government, mitigated by the\n            RGoB's ongoing capacity building efforts (in many areas\n            supported by development partners); and (c) political risk\n            of changing government priorities, mitigated by the\n            RGoB's wide consultations on the development agenda and\n            its commitment to sustaining reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bhutan - Second Development Policy Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bhutan - Second Development\n            Policy Credit
