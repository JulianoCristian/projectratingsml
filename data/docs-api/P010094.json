This second impact evaluation covers\n            four projects, two in India and one each in Bangladesh and\n            Pakistan. In concept, these four projects were modeled on\n            the Indian Tarai project, which was the subject of the\n            previous evaluation. An important issue for this impact\n            evaluation is the extent to which the leading role assigned\n            to the public sector in these projects has affected the\n            emergence of the private seed industry. The evaluation\n            concludes that the development strategy followed by the\n            Governments and the Bank worked well. The initial injection\n            of training and expertise to assist the public sector\n            provided the basis for private sector development.\n            Decentralization of the seed parastatals in India and\n            Pakistan helped defuse potential opposition to the growth of\n            the private sector. And the Bank's initial support of\n            the public sector has assured it a 'seat at the\n            table' from which to argue for a level-playing field\n            for the private sector. The most successful aspects of these\n            projects were usually training and the creation of\n            institutions for seed testing and certification."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh,
