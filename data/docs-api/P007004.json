The project\n            had two basic objectives: to improve the reliability of\n            electricity service in the Dominican Republic, and to\n            improve Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE)'s\n            operational efficiency and restore its finances,\n            characterized by a chronic state of insolvency and poor\n            operational performance. The Borrower performance in project\n            implementation was deficient. In sum, the project outcome\n            was highly unsatisfactory, as it failed to meet its main\n            objectives. The main lessons learned are: a) There is a high\n            risk that investments in the rehabilitation of power\n            facilities will be wasted if there are no adequate\n            incentives in place for the performance of power utilities.\n            b) A long list of loan conditions on performance goals is\n            not a good substitute for a few and specific actions on\n            institutional change.c) Improving sector efficiency based on\n            performance contracts that call for the financial and\n            operational rehabilitation of a state-owned enterprise which\n            continues operating as a monopoly with limited autonomy and\n            accountability does not work and is not sustainable. d) The\n            participation of private firms in the provision of\n            generation and distribution services may be an essential\n            instrument for improving sector performance in a country\n            like Dominican
