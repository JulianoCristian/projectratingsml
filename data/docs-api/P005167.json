It is likely that the modest achievements of\n            the project will be sustainable. With regard to Bank\n            performance, the International Development Association (IDA)\n            has not played a substantial role in the privatization\n            processin Egypt, though its catalytic role in strengthening\n            the institutional capacity of public enterprises, even with\n            all its shortcomings, formed an important base for the\n            eventual continuation of the process. Overall, Bank\n            performance was rated satisfactory. Borrower performance was\n            deficient overall. Key lessons learned included the\n            following: strong commitment from Borrowers is needed for\n            technical assistance. when there are doubts about government\n            commitment, proper safeguards should be built into the\n            project design. Secondly, risks should be identified and the\n            likelihood of their occurrence assessed and taken into\n            account in the project design. Third, where Borrower\n            commitment to a project has weakened, and willingness to use\n            IDA funding has become insufficient, decisions to cancel the\n            project should be made early. Fourth, Constraints should be\n            taken into acount in establishing realistic targets. Fifth,\n            the timing of privatization should be carefully assessed\n            while an economic reform or structural adjustment program is\n            underway. Sixth, the Bank should consider whether to offer\n            technical assistance for a fee."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Technical Assistance Project for\n            Privatization, Enterprise, and
