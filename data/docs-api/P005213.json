Lessons first point at the need for\n            detailed designs, and tender documents to be ready at loan\n            effectiveness, so as not to delay construction works,\n            regardless of a perceived urgency to present the project to\n            the Board prior to the completeness of its preparation. This\n            in fact caused not only construction delays, but distracted\n            attention to implementation as a result of insufficient\n            preparation. Likewise, technical feasibility of local\n            contractors should be assessed, exemplified in this case by\n            the absence of local technology for protecting dikes during\n            construction. Fortunately, reliable consultants were able to\n            implement contractual incentives, an effective option to\n            prod implementation, and management. The long lending\n            suspension to Iran, calls for a financial management plan,\n            to be partly expressed in a detailed implementation manual,\n            and thus, circumvent the lack of experience with Bank\n            procedures, procurement, and disbursement. Finally, linking\n            Bank disbursements in the local currency - an exchange rate\n            with little relevance to that of the Tehran stock exchange -\n            produced negative results; rather, disbursements should have\n            been linked to the Tehran stock exchange."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Iran - Sistan Flood Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Iran - Sistan Flood Control Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/12/1671223/iran-sistan-flood-control-project","projn":"IR-Sistan Flood Ctrl -- P005213","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Flood Control,Business Environment,Economic Theory & Research,Engineering,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Iran, Islamic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02011504015860"},"subsc":"Flood protection,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,agricultural\n            output,Agriculture,alkalinity,asphalt,assets,bridge,bridges,Budgeting,bulldozers,capacity\n            building,Central Bank,construction,construction\n            sites,Consumer Price Index,contractors,cost overruns,cost\n            streams,culverts,dikes,drainage,earthworks,economic\n            life,Economic Rate of Return,emergency\n            response,excavators,exchange rates,expenditures,extreme\n            floods,feasibility studies,flexibility,Flood,Flood\n            Control,flood control infrastructure,Flood Control\n            Project,flood control works,flood damage,flood damage to\n            property,flood damages,flood emergency,flood event,flood\n            events,flood hazards,flood protection,flood protection\n            facilities,Flood Warning,Flood\n            waters,flooding,Floods,framework,GDP,GNP,gradients,Gross\n            Domestic Product,Gross National Product,heavy\n            rainfall,impact assessment,irrigation,land\n            acquisition,loaders,machinery,maintenance costs,major\n            floods,mean sea level,measurements,momentum,natural\n            disasters,organizational structures,peak flows,ports,private\n            property,procurement,protection against\n            floods,Purchasing,Quality Assurance,Quality Assurance\n            Group,quality control,reservoirs,river training,river\n            training works,rivers,routine\n            maintenance,sand,Sanitation,severe\n            floods,snow,soils,structures,technical\n            assistance,tributary,trucks,vehicles,verge,water level,water\n            storage,Water Supply,wind"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,agricultural\n            output,Agriculture,alkalinity,asphalt,assets,bridge,bridges,Budgeting,bulldozers,capacity\n            building,Central Bank,construction,construction\n            sites,Consumer Price Index,contractors,cost overruns,cost\n            streams,culverts,dikes,drainage,earthworks,economic\n            life,Economic Rate of Return,emergency\n            response,excavators,exchange rates,expenditures,extreme\n            floods,feasibility studies,flexibility,Flood,Flood\n            Control,flood control infrastructure,Flood Control\n            Project,flood control works,flood damage,flood damage to\n            property,flood damages,flood emergency,flood event,flood\n            events,flood hazards,flood protection,flood protection\n            facilities,Flood Warning,Flood\n            waters,flooding,Floods,framework,GDP,GNP,gradients,Gross\n            Domestic Product,Gross National Product,heavy\n            rainfall,impact assessment,irrigation,land\n            acquisition,loaders,machinery,maintenance costs,major\n            floods,mean sea level,measurements,momentum,natural\n            disasters,organizational structures,peak flows,ports,private\n            property,procurement,protection against\n            floods,Purchasing,Quality Assurance,Quality Assurance\n            Group,quality control,reservoirs,river training,river\n            training works,rivers,routine\n            maintenance,sand,Sanitation,severe\n            floods,snow,soils,structures,technical\n            assistance,tributary,trucks,vehicles,verge,water level,water\n            storage,Water Supply,wind"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF021251-PHRD-JAPANESE CTF (USD ACCOUNT),TF039389-MIDDLE EAST AND PACIFIC -\n            SEWERAGE (IRAN, YEMAN, LEBANON),TF037102-YEMEN - SANA'S WS.,\n            NAT'L COM.
