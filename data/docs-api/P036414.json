Some lessons\n            learned included: when planning water transmission for city\n            uses through rural areas, engineers need to consider the\n            needs of local farmers and rural populations en route, to\n            provide some benefits to them also. The duplication of the\n            Lijiang water diversion canal, providing water for rural\n            populations and local farmers, was ultimately necessary\n            overcome their initial opposition. Water quality\n            improvements cannot succeed through collection and treatment\n            of domestic wastewater alone. Complementary industrial\n            pollution reduction programs are necessary to achieve water\n            quality objectives. Community participation in\n            infrastructure planning, implementation, and management is a\n            viable and socially acceptable alternative to redevelopment\n            even in rapidly growing cities. The small area improvement\n            (SAI) component demonstrated the feasibility of proactive\n            community participation, cost sharing, empowerment and\n            poverty alleviation. Introduction of new contracting\n            methods, such as turnkey contracting, should be done after\n            model bidding documents have been introduced, or after\n            standard documents have been thoroughly discussed and\n            understood during project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Guangxi Urban Environment

environmental\n            impacts and countermeasures to eliminate or mitigate them\n            for three subprojects: 1) The Rongsha Lakes Treatment\n            Project in Guilin City replenishes Lake Ronghu and Lake\n            Shahu, improves the wastewater collection system, and builds\n            a new pumping station. 2) The Chaoyangxi Comprehensive\n            Treatment Project in Nanning City renews the Chaoyang\n            Stream, betters the city's wastewater and rain\n            collecting system, and builds wastewater treatment plants.\n            3) The Lijiang Comprehensive Treatment Project in Guilin\n            City replenishes the river and protects its dikes, improves\n            the sewage treatment system and wastewater collecting\n            system, and builds wastewater treatment plants. During\n            subproject construction, measures to prevent raised dust\n            include: encircling the construction site with braided\n            plastic fabrics; storing only earth needed to fill in the\n            site, sprinkling water during the dry season when earth is\n            stored, loaded and transported; closely covering vehicles\n            transporting construction materials like cement, lime, and\n            construction refuse; and removing the concrete mixer and\n            lathes far from inhabitants, institutions, or schools. To\n            prevent and reduce construction noise, workers will abide by\n            the city's rules and regulations; avoid using\n            noise-making machines at noon or during the night; adopt the\n            method of underground pipe-jacking and optimize machine use\n            time. Ecological damage to land and trees in the vicinity of\n            the construction can be alleviated by enclosing the sites,\n            and shortening the construction period. Greenbelts should be\n            planted along the open tunnels as soon as they are\n            completed. The flow of garbage can be checked by burying it\n            in enclosed places like mountain hollows. Dredging will be\n            used to counter the effects of heavy metals and other\n            pollutants in water bodies. Countermeasures to reduce\n            expected negative impacts during the dredging of water\n            bodies include: dredging only during the dry season to\n            reduce water contained in the sediment and shorten drying\n            time; transporting temporarily piled bottom clay to prevent\n            its being washed back into the river; building water\n            overflow tunnels when encircling banks of piled sediment;\n            spreading bactericides to prevent water quality\n            deterioration and the multiplication of flies and\n            mosquitoes; sprinkling a bleaching solution to destroy\n            noisome smells and kill noxious germs; protecting workers\n            with gas masks containing activated carbon fiber; and piling\n            and covering up sediment from solid wastes to prevent runoff\n            pollution and foul smells. During the operational phase,\n            sludge produced by the wastewater treatment plant will be\n            mitigated by clearing inorganic sand from the sedimentation\n            basin, and making mudcakes of the dehydrated sludge to be\n            used as fertilizer, if found to be safe, or in a sanitary\n            land fill, if proven harmful. Shock absorbers will be used\n            too alleviate the noise from the pumping station. To counter\n            wastewater pollution, rainwater amounts will be controlled;\n            wastewater interception, absorption, and clearing capacity\n            will be employed; and the flow of rainwater entering water\n            bodies will be controlled and increased to prevent\n            eutrophication or diverted into another water body."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

Guangxi Urban Environment Project :\n            environmental impact assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This environmental assessment for the\n            Guangxi Urban Environment Project details environmental\n            impacts and countermeasures to eliminate or mitigate them\n            for three subprojects: 1) The Rongsha Lakes Treatment\n            Project in Guilin City replenishes Lake Ronghu and Lake\n            Shahu, improves the wastewater collection system, and builds\n            a new pumping station. 2) The Chaoyangxi Comprehensive\n            Treatment Project in Nanning City renews the Chaoyang\n            Stream, betters the city's wastewater and rain\n            collecting system, and builds wastewater treatment plants.\n            3) The Lijiang Comprehensive Treatment Project in Guilin\n            City replenishes the river and protects its dikes, improves\n            the sewage treatment system and wastewater collecting\n            system, and builds wastewater treatment plants. During\n            subproject construction, measures to prevent raised dust\n            include: encircling the construction site with braided\n            plastic fabrics; storing only earth needed to fill in the\n            site, sprinkling water during the dry season when earth is\n            stored, loaded and transported; closely covering vehicles\n            transporting construction materials like cement, lime, and\n            construction refuse; and removing the concrete mixer and\n            lathes far from inhabitants, institutions, or schools. To\n            prevent and reduce construction noise, workers will abide by\n            the city's rules and regulations; avoid using\n            noise-making machines at noon or during the night; adopt the\n            method of underground pipe-jacking and optimize machine use\n            time. Ecological damage to land and trees in the vicinity of\n            the construction can be alleviated by enclosing the sites,\n            and shortening the construction period. Greenbelts should be\n            planted along the open tunnels as soon as they are\n            completed. The flow of garbage can be checked by burying it\n            in enclosed places like mountain hollows. Dredging will be\n            used to counter the effects of heavy metals and other\n            pollutants in water bodies. Countermeasures to reduce\n            expected negative impacts during the dredging of water\n            bodies include: dredging only during the dry season to\n            reduce water contained in the sediment and shorten drying\n            time; transporting temporarily piled bottom clay to prevent\n            its being washed back into the river; building water\n            overflow tunnels when encircling banks of piled sediment;\n            spreading bactericides to prevent water quality\n            deterioration and the multiplication of flies and\n            mosquitoes; sprinkling a bleaching solution to destroy\n            noisome smells and kill noxious germs; protecting workers\n            with gas masks containing activated carbon fiber; and piling\n            and covering up sediment from solid wastes to prevent runoff\n            pollution and foul smells. During the operational phase,\n            sludge produced by the wastewater treatment plant will be\n            mitigated by clearing inorganic sand from the sedimentation\n            basin, and making mudcakes of the dehydrated sludge to be\n            used as fertilizer, if found to be safe, or in a sanitary\n            land fill, if proven harmful. Shock absorbers will be used\n            too alleviate the noise from the pumping station. To counter\n            wastewater pollution, rainwater amounts will be controlled;\n            wastewater interception, absorption, and clearing capacity\n            will be employed; and the flow of rainwater entering water\n            bodies will be controlled and increased to prevent\n            eutrophication or diverted into another water body."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
