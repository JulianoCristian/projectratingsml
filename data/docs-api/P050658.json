Some lessons learned: Accreditation processes\n            are difficult in remote regions and are vulnerable to\n            manipulation. When carried out as envisioned, the National\n            Board of Accreditation's certification is comprehensive\n            and rigorous. However, it is frequently difficult to arrange\n            for experts to visit institutes in remote regions, and there\n            is potential for manipulation of the accreditation process.\n            Autonomy is important, but institutes must be ready for it\n            in terms of accountability and initiative. A number of\n            institutes receiving autonomy under both projects benefitted\n            in terms of being able to pursue cutting-edge fields of\n            research and cost recovery. However, many were not equipped\n            to make effective use of autonomy, due to low confidence,\n            responsibility and initiative. Systemic reform in Indian\n            technical education is incomplete without the inclusion of\n            private institutes. Given that private institutes enroll\n            approximately 85 percent of all students studying\n            engineering in India, improving the technical education\n            system requires their participation on a much larger scale\n            than occurred in either project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Technician Education Project ;\n            and Technical and Engineering

the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: quality and relevance of education drives demand\n            for technical education and is necessary to increased\n            efficiency. Quality improvements were necessary to not only\n            increase demand for technical education, but also to\n            increase employment rates and salaries of graduates. The\n            increased demand led to a more than doubling of the capacity\n            utilization, which together with the betterment of the labor\n            market outcomes significantly increased efficiency of\n            technician education. As such, quality of education can\n            drive efficiency of education. Low demand and prestige of\n            technician education can be overcome. In many countries,\n            including India, technician education are at time perceived\n            to be the less alternative to academic, generalist secondary\n            and tertiary education. This project succeeded in raising\n            interest and prestige of technician education through its\n            quality improvements and the related marketing campaign of\n            the improvements. Such quality initiatives and the marketing\n            of high placement rates can overcome a perceived low\n            prestige of technician education. Projects can achieve\n            strong results in remote and less economically developed\n            areas. Despite a limited implementation capacity, little\n            experience with Bank projects, and remoteness in\n            transportation, the support states/ union territory (UT)\n            provided the political support and engagement to achieve the\n            project's results. The project confirms that strong\n            outcomes can be achieved despite remoteness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Technician Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Third Technician\n            Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/12/9349535/india-third-technician-education-project","projn":"IN-Third Technician Education Project -- P050658","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"m,Teaching and Learning,Primary Education,Tertiary Education,Access & Equity in Basic Education","teratopic":"Education","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20080411013038"},"theme":"Urban services and housing for the poor,Rural services and infrastructure,Participation and civic engagement,Gender,Education for the knowledge economy","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Vocational training","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access for women, access to training,\n            Accounting, accreditation, achievement, Achievements,\n            advanced human capital, APR, Assessment of Risk, Audits,\n            Bank education, Bank Lending, Beneficiaries, Beneficiary,\n            best practice, best practice guidelines, best practices,\n            Borrower, calculation, civic engagement, classrooms,\n            community programs, Community service, community services,\n            computer science, continuing education, contributions, cost\n            per student, Cost recovery, credit systems,\n            cross-fertilization, CURRENCY, current prices, curricula,\n            curriculum, curriculum design, decentralization, decision\n            making, disadvantaged groups, distance education, economic\n            analysis, Education Department, education institutions,\n            education programs, education projects, Education Quality,\n            Education Sector, educational opportunities, educational\n            outcomes, educational programs, employment, engineering\n            education, enrollment, enrollment capacity, enrolment rate,\n            enrolments, entrepreneurial skills, equal access, Exchange\n            rate, expenditures, extension centers, External efficiency,\n            faculty members, family members, female students, female\n            teachers, Financial Analysis, Financial Management,\n            financial sustainability, formal training programs, further\n            education, girls, graduate programs, Higher Education, Human\n            Development, Human Resource Development, income, indigenous\n            people, industrial training, institutional autonomy,\n            interventions, knowledge economy, knowledge sharing, labor\n            force, labor market, labor market needs, leadership,\n            Learning, learning opportunities, learning outcomes,\n            learning process, learning resources, lectures, library\n            resources, lifetime, literacy, Loan, long term planning,\n            manuals, market demands, marketing, marketing campaigns,\n            middle-income families, non-formal training, nonformal\n            training, orphans, peer institutions, Performance\n            Indicators, polytechnics, post-secondary education, poverty\n            alleviation, poverty level, principals, private investment,\n            Private sector involvement, productivity, professors,\n            project based teaching, public goods, public institutions,\n            public schools, purchases, qualified teachers, Quality % of\n            teachers, Quality Assurance, quality of education, quality\n            of infrastructure, quality of teaching, rapid growth, rate\n            of return, recurrent cost, recurrent costs, repetition,\n            repetition rate, rural areas, rural students, salaries,\n            salary, sale, sales, savings, schools, secondary school,\n            shortage of faculty, skill development, skilled labor,\n            skills training, Social Development, Stakeholder,\n            stakeholders, student body, student costs, student drop out,\n            Student intake, student participation, student population,\n            teacher, teacher shortage, Teachers, teaching, teaching\n            positions, Technical Education, technical knowledge,\n            Technical Training, technical training institutions,\n            termination, Tertiary education, training facilities,\n            training \u00b7 Funds, tuition, unemployment, urban services,\n            vocational education, Vocational training, vocational\n            training courses, youth"}},"owner":"S.A.

To meet\n            the demands of the changing labor market, International\n            Development Association (IDA) supported India's long\n            term program of reforms in the middle level technical\n            education system dealing with training of technicians and\n            supervisors.

in remote states of the Northeastern\n            region, to expand capacity, and improve the quality of\n            technician education, in order to meet specific economic\n            needs of each state. It will also increase the access of\n            disadvantaged groups - i.e., women, and rural youth - to\n            technician education, and training. The components will: 1)\n            develop and expand capacity, by establishing six new\n            educational polytechnics, and a skill development center.\n            Furthermore, existing polytechnics will be strengthened ,\n            with the introduction of new programs. Continuing education,\n            and non-formal training programs, will be introduced per\n            industry requirements, and community needs, providing\n            student, and faculty housing facilities; 2) enhance the\n            quality of education, by modernizing existing laboratories,\n            and workshops, developing, and revising curricula to meet\n            labor market needs, and entrepreneurial requirements.\n            Learning resources will be improved, promoting interaction\n            with industry, and community members; and, 3) improve\n            efficiency of state boards, council, or directorates in\n            dealing with technician education, by conducting research\n            studies for systemic reforms, instituting computer-based\n            project, and financial management systems, and providing\n            substantial academic, and financial autonomy to project polytechnics."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
