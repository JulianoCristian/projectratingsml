Some lessons\n            learned included: continuity of Bank staff in charge of\n            project supervision is critical to the success of projects\n            that operate in a challenging environment. The linkage\n            between project components, outputs, and outcomes needs to\n            be clearly identified at project design stage to arrive at\n            more realistic project development objectives (PDOs). PDOs\n            need to be supported by project components that are\n            consistent with the results framework. An effective\n            mechanism to jump-start institutional development of\n            newly-formed entities and to speed up the learning curve is\n            to organize twinning arrangements with well-known\n            institutions that are committed to the sponsorship of best\n            practices.

pilot sectors. The closing\n            date of the project will be extended for five months from\n            October 31, 2012 until March 31, 2012. This will be the\n            second project extension with a cumulated extension period\n            of 23 months. Overall implementation progress has been\n            encouraging despite a number of operational difficulties and\n            delays related to project activity disruptions caused by the\n            repeated domestic political and social unrests that took\n            place over the course of implementation.
