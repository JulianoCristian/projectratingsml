Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: in Vietnam it is increasingly likely that\n            projects that build water infrastructure will be called on\n            to perform environmental restoration as well as their core\n            activities, if they are to have sustainable outcomes. The\n            four projects studied share certain characteristics. First\n            and foremost is the nature of their relationship to the\n            environment. Whereas traditionally Bank water sector\n            projects had either an institutional or infrastructure focus\n            or both, it is becoming nearly impossible to avoid\n            addressing environmental restoration and environmentally\n            related land use questions in many areas of the country. In\n            the four evaluated projects it was assumed that investments\n            in infrastructure will overcome what were in essence\n            environmental problems. If all the mangroves have been\n            destroyed it is never enough just to plant new ones:\n            reforestation and forest protection have to address the\n            underlying social causes of encroachment and provide\n            alternative sources of income if they hope to stop\n            environmentally negative actions that produce income for the\n            malefactors. Conversely, addressing livelihood problems can\n            have positive environmental impacts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Irrigation Rehabilitation Project;\n            Water Supply Project;
