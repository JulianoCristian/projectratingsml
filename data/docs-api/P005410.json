The project will support the\n            achievement of these objectives through:  (a) increasing\n            private investments in agriculture; (b) improving access by\n            small farmers to institutional credit; (c) promoting\n            mobilization of domestic savings; and (d) strengthening\n            CNCA's management efficiency and financial situation.\n            The project will finance farm investments through CNCA\n            during the period September 1983 to August 1986, including:\n            (a) investments by small farmers; (b) investments by\n            Agrarian Reform Cooperatives; (c) investments by medium and\n            large farmers; and (d) agro-industry investments. The\n            project will also include improvement of CNCA's\n            physical infrastructure, management information systems and\n            loan monitoring and evaluation, and define a
