The\n            Economic Recovery Credit Project had the following ratings:\n            outcome was highly satisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was not evaluable; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The Economic Management Credit Project had the\n            following ratings: outcome was moderately satisfactory;\n            sustainability was likely; institutional development impact\n            was modest; Bank performance was unsatisfactory; and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The Third Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project had the following ratings: outcome\n            was moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability was likely;\n            institutional development impact was modest; Bank\n            performance was unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. The main lessons learned from this review are:\n            1) Country ownership matters very much. The components of\n            the loans that were owned by the country, such as the public\n            resource management and some of the structural adjustment\n            components were generally successfully implemented; 2) As a\n            general rule, it would be very useful for the Bank to listen\n            better and to go to extra lengths to explain it s positions,\n            and to solicit views and seek genuine agreement with country\n            authorities. This could improve country ownership of\n            programs; 3) It is important to keep a good and substantive\n            dialogue with the main development partners; again by\n            listening better to their view points, keeping them better\n            informed about those of the Bank, and seeking to reach\n            agreements when possible; and 4) As has happened already\n            with the Fourth Structural Adjustment Credit, it would be\n            preferable to keep the design of adjustment operations\n            simple and focused on a limited number of key policy areas,\n            whose implementation can be realistically expected within\n            the short disbursement period dictated by an adjustment operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - First

development impact as modest, Bank performance\n            as satisfactory, and Borrower performance as satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned include: A macroeconomic adjustment\n            program dealing with policy reforms and administrative\n            restructuring at the central levels of Government should not\n            be combined with a grassroots operation in widely dispersed\n            rural areas. These usually require intensive supervision and\n            likely some technical and operational support, which is\n            difficult to accommodate within the structure of an\n            adjustment operation. Another approach may be to arrange\n            with one of the resident bilateral donors to provide this\n            type of assistance under a cofinancing agreement. Careful\n            attention should be paid to the design of progress and\n            output monitoring indicators, to ensure that there is a\n            clear relationship between the inputs provided under the\n            project and the expected output. That was not always the\n            case in this project. For example, the impact of the\n            mandated recruitment of additional primary school teachers\n            on primary school enrollment ratios could have been offset\n            by other factors, leading to a constant ratio. The correct\n            assessment of the impact would require estimates holding\n            other influences constant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Economic Management Credit
