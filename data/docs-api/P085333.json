The project comprises two main components:\n            1) The Cuijiaying navigation and power complex component\n            entails the construction of a dam, ship-lock, power station,\n            including access roads and bridges. In addition, these works\n            further require dredging along diversion channels, and works\n            to strengthen reservoir banks. 2) The institutional\n            development component includes provision of capacity\n            building to implementing agencies - Hubei Provincial\n            Communications Department (HPCD) - and the Cuijiaying\n            Complex Management Office (CCMO) through specific training,\n            and study tours.

Proposed measures to reduce risks\n            include the following: Prevent floods by maintaining normal\n            levels for dams and reservoirs. Adopt measures to prevent\n            riverbank erosion and dam breaches. Promote repair and\n            maintenance of the flood release gates and channels, and\n            provide incentives to promote water and electricity\n            conservation. Collect wastewater in sedimentation tanks,\n            acquire underground sewage treatment equipment and use\n            septic tanks for temporary residences. Spray water regularly\n            to damp down dust, and promptly clean up dirt scattered by\n            construction machinery. Choose low-volume construction\n            machinery, schedule work for daytime, and impose time limits\n            in sensitive areas. Adopt water and soil erosion prevention\n            measures such as building retaining walls, protecting\n            slopes, and drainage systems. Promptly refill earth and tamp\n            id needed if there is (tree) cutting. Recover vegetation\n            promptly from borrow pits and disposal areas for excavated\n            materials. Regularly monitor the environment. Protect\n            cultural relics. Avoid discharging industrial wastewater\n            into reservoir area and other water bodies unless\n            pre-treated to reduce pollution. Ships and vessels are\n            banned from discharging waste oil, manure, and garbage into\n            water bodies, and they must be equipped with oil-water\n            separators. Ships and vessels must also be controlled for\n            noise. Apply regulations to prevent accidental spills of\n            hazardous waste; leaks and spills must promptly be reported.\n            Establish a fishery protection system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Fifth Inland Waterways Project -\n            environmental assessment summary"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Fifth Inland Waterways\n            Project - environmental assessment summary"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/01/5653073/china-fifth-inland-waterways-project-environmental-assessment-summary","projn":"CN-China:  Fifth Inland Waterways -- P085333","docty":"Board Report","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Water Conservation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"China","authors":{"authr":"Hubei Provincial Communications Bureau"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050310095854"},"subsc":"Ports, waterways and shipping,Renewable energy","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Board Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accidents, afforestation, agricultural\n            production, agriculture, Air Pollution, Air Quality,\n            Animals, approach channel, basin, beach, catchment, channel,\n            channels, clay, compaction, concrete, Conservation,\n            CONSTRUCTION, construction activities, construction sites,\n            discharge, disposable income, diversion, domestic wastes,\n            drain, drainage, drainage area, drinking water, dust,\n            economic development, ecosystem, electricity, engine,\n            environmental impacts, environmental management,\n            environmental monitoring, environmental problems,\n            ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, EROSION, evaporation, excavation,\n            Exploitation, export, fish, flood control, Forestry,\n            framework, frost, garbage, garden, grade, Hail, high water,\n            Hydropower Development, ice, industrial solid waste,\n            industrial water, INFORMATION DISCLOSURE, inundation,\n            irrigation, land development, landslip, navigation,\n            neutralization, Noise, Noise Pollution, oil, paving, pH, pH\n            value, PM, Pollution, power generation, precipitation,\n            pretreatment, production process, PUBLIC HEALTH, rainfall,\n            Rainfall distribution, RIVER, river course, roads, runoff,\n            Safety, sand, screening, Secondary sewage treatment,\n            sediment, sedimentation, seepage, sewage, sewage treatment,\n            shallow water, ships, slag, slope stability, Soil\n            Conservation, Soil Erosion, Solid Waste, solid wastes,\n            speed, spring, sterilization, stone, SURFACE WATER, surface\n            water quality, temperature, transport, transportation,\n            trees, urban garbage, vegetation, vibration, waste water,\n            wastes, water body, water consumption, water Engineering,\n            water intakes, WATER LEVEL, water levels, Water Pollution,\n            Water Pollution Prevention, water power utilization, water\n            quality, water quality protection, water resources, water\n            supply, water system, wind"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"31752"},"facets":{}}}
