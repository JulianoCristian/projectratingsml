The two\n            main components address the following: 1) Improving\n            transparency, and economic governance will require a\n            comprehensive reform of the public finance system, for which\n            the component will include: a) budget preparation, and\n            management, on the basis of a comprehensive computerized\n            system, to which all agencies involved in budget, and\n            expenditure management would be connected. The system would\n            encompass the whole national budget, i.e., wages, non-salary\n            operating costs, investment, debt service, income\n            mobilization (customs, taxes); b) adjusting the existing\n            institutional, and procedural framework to international\n            standards.
