The objectives of the project were: (i) to\n            increase agricultural productivity by providing adequate\n            drainage infrastructure; (ii) to evacuate excess water and\n            salt out of the production areas, and hence reverse the\n            deterioration of the land resource base; and (iii) to\n            strengthen the Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage\n            Projects (EPADP) for the design, construction supervision\n            and management of drainage activities, with particular\n            emphasis on improvement of monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) and maintenance of the improved drainage\n            facilities. EPADP performance was highly satisfactory in\n            design, investigations and implementation; it fully complied\n            with all the legal covenants related to annual reviews,\n            staffing and budgetary provisions. The performance of the\n            World Bank is considered satisfactory throughout. The\n            following are the major lessons learned: (i) Technical\n            assistance and training requirements, if not provided\n            through Bank financing, must be agreed to in detail between\n            the Borrower and Co-financiers before project negotiations;\n            (ii) Strict enforcement of conditions defined in contract\n            documents, particularly those relating to completion of\n            works and cancellation of contracts including forfeiture of\n            performance bonds, should be adhered to by Borrower; (iii)\n            Civil works contractors should be pre-qualified to eliminate\n            those who cannot perform well or have a troubled\n            contracting; (iv) Well-defined monitoring indicators,\n            particularly those related to impact analysis must be\n            prepared at appraisal and periodic reviews of such\n            indicators should take place during project supervision; and\n            (v) Project supervision missions should have included in\n            addition to the engineer, M&E specialist, etc., an\n            agriculturist who could have followed up on the\n            project's impact on agricultural production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Fifth Drainage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Fifth Drainage Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/04/733944/egypt-fifth-drainage-project","projn":"EG-Drainage V -- P005052","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Roads & Highways,Wetlands,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Business in Development","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Water Resources,Agriculture,Transport,Private Sector Development","count":"Egypt, Arab Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa!$!517202"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019111604"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Agriculture,Transport,Private Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,acquisition,agricultural\n            lands,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,Agriculture,catchment,catchment\n            area,Construction,cost recovery,crop,crop\n            yields,cropping,cropping patterns,data\n            collection,dates,Drainage,Drainage Area,drainage\n            facilities,drainage infrastructure,drainage\n            systems,Equipment,Excavation,FAO,farm,farm\n            income,farmers,farming,fur,Gender,impact analysis,impact\n            evaluation,income,Internal Rate of Return,local\n            contractors,long- term sustainability,maintenance\n            costs,Natural Resources,private sector,private sector\n            contracting,Procurement,Rate of\n            Return,reporting,salinity,selling,Vehicles,water\n            logging,Water Resources,water tables,weed control"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,acquisition,agricultural\n            lands,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,Agriculture,catchment,catchment\n            area,Construction,cost recovery,crop,crop\n            yields,cropping,cropping patterns,data\n            collection,dates,Drainage,Drainage Area,drainage\n            facilities,drainage infrastructure,drainage\n            systems,Equipment,Excavation,FAO,farm,farm\n            income,farmers,farming,fur,Gender,impact analysis,impact\n            evaluation,income,Internal Rate of Return,local\n            contractors,long- term sustainability,maintenance\n            costs,Natural Resources,private sector,private sector\n            contracting,Procurement,Rate of\n            Return,reporting,salinity,selling,Vehicles,water\n            logging,Water Resources,water tables,weed control"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe, Middle East and North Africa"}},"repnb":"14247"},"740029":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/05/740029/egypt-fifth-drainage-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/05/740029/egypt-fifth-drainage-project","new_url":"1985/05/740029/egypt-fifth-drainage-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/05/01/000009265_3970625094716/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/05/01/000009265_3970625094716/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2562","docdt":"1985-05-31T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-05-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Fifth Drainage Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Fifth Drainage Project's\n            objectives are to increase farm production by reversing the\n            deteriorating salt and water balance in 465,000 feddans\n            (482,670 acres), and to strengthen the Egyptian Public\n            Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP) to improve standards\n            of implementation, quality control, maintenance and\n            monitoring.
