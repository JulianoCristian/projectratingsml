The lessons learned indicate\n            that the demand survey for the Private Enterprise Support\n            Project (PESP) resulted in an overestimation of credit\n            demand and did not go far enough in identifying demand for\n            specific lending products. The PESP required partial payment\n            from enterprises for technical assistance. However, this\n            component was not successful as enterprises, generally were\n            not interested such assistance, perceiving the support\n            either as a waste or available free of charge through grant\n            financing. In the end, the project did not disburse any\n            funds for this component. It is important to make sure that\n            the implementation framework is clear from the outset of the\n            project and that lines of authority are unambiguous. While\n            the government has taken a number of important steps to\n            strengthen the business environment, PESP enterprise surveys\n            indicated a number of perceived deficiencies in the business\n            environment continue to adversely affect private enterprise\n            development. PESP had seven different task managers over an\n            eight-year period. Such changes substantially disrupted\n            project supervision, reduced institutional memory, and led\n            to frequent shifts in approaches and strategies. Auditing\n            remains a major issues for SME support projects in\n            underdeveloped financial and banking sectors such as the\n            Kyrgyz Republic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Private Enterprise Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Private\n            Enterprise Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/03/3067567/kyrgyz-republic-private-enterprise-support-project","projn":"KG-Private Enterprise Support Project -- P008524","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Municipal Financial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Kyrgyz Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040402150337"},"subsc":"Banking,Other industry","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,actual\n            cost,assets,auditing,audits,bank officers,Bank\n            Performance,banking sector,banking\n            system,capitalization,collateral,commercial\n            banks,competition policy,competitiveness,cost of\n            capital,credit officers,credit policies,credit\n            risk,debt,debt\n            servicing,depositors,deposits,depreciation,economic\n            conditions,economic rate of return,economic\n            reform,economics,feasibility studies,financial\n            crisis,financial institutions,financial management,Financial\n            Sector,Financial Sector Development,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,Institutional Development,institutional\n            reform,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            accounting standards,local enterprises,macroeconomic\n            performance,macroeconomic stability,management\n            efficiency,management information\n            systems,maturity,microfinance,operating costs,political\n            interference,portfolio,private banking,private commercial\n            banks,Privatization,problem\n            loans,productivity,profitability,real GDP,regulatory\n            framework,Return on equity,risk evaluation,risk\n            management,Savings,shareholders,Structural\n            Adjustment,Technical Assistance,transaction\n            costs,transparency,working capital,World Trade Organization,WTO"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,actual\n            cost,assets,auditing,audits,bank officers,Bank\n            Performance,banking sector,banking\n            system,capitalization,collateral,commercial\n            banks,competition policy,competitiveness,cost of\n            capital,credit officers,credit policies,credit\n            risk,debt,debt\n            servicing,depositors,deposits,depreciation,economic\n            conditions,economic rate of return,economic\n            reform,economics,feasibility studies,financial\n            crisis,financial institutions,financial management,Financial\n            Sector,Financial Sector Development,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,Institutional Development,institutional\n            reform,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,international\n            accounting standards,local enterprises,macroeconomic\n            performance,macroeconomic stability,management\n            efficiency,management information\n            systems,maturity,microfinance,operating costs,political\n            interference,portfolio,private banking,private commercial\n            banks,Privatization,problem\n            loans,productivity,profitability,real GDP,regulatory\n            framework,Return on equity,risk evaluation,risk\n            management,Savings,shareholders,Structural\n            Adjustment,Technical Assistance,transaction\n            costs,transparency,working capital,World Trade Organization,WTO"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financial Intermediary Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF022156-PHRD 2-PRIV.
