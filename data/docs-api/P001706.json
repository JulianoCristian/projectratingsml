The project is aimed at protecting the\n            small but significant institutional gains made to date in\n            the sector, as well as preventing deterioration in\n            maintenance equipment and the road network itself, while\n            discussions between the Government, the IMF and the\n            Association proceed on a request for assistance in preparing\n            an overall plan for reform of the economy, including\n            financing of road maintenance. The main project risk would\n            be the failure of the financial arrangements concerning the\n            Road Fund. Should sufficient funds not be forthcoming, road\n            maintenance operations would have to be reduced, either in\n            extent or in duration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Road Maintenance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali -
