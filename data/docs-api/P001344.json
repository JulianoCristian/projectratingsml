The lessons\n            learned indicate that Kenya's inability to secure more\n            favorable terms under the Project Performance Assessments\n            (PPAs) can be attributed to several factors, such as a\n            fragile macro-economic environment, poor governance of the\n            sector, weak financial performance of Kenya Power and\n            Lighting Company Limited (KPLC) as the power offtaker under\n            the PPAs, an inadequate track record with implementation of\n            an autonomous regulatory framework, and perceptions of high\n            resource risk in the case of geothermal power development.\n            Another important lesson was the recognition that, for\n            projects involving substantial resource risk, a\n            public-private partnership approach may be necessary to\n            ensure successful implementation. During its seven years of\n            existence, the Electricity Regulatory Board (ERB) has\n            experienced a high turnover of its top management amid\n            disputes with the Government about entity's managerial\n            practices. The setting up of a dedicated project\n            implementation team, including external experts, if needed,\n            at an early stage of project formulation is also a lesson to\n            be drawn from the implementation of the Project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya -
