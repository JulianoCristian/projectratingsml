The lessons learned indicate that\n            a Technical Assistance project which accompanies an\n            adjustment credit should not be prepared as an\n            after-thought. It should be properly designed and be subject\n            to the standard quality assurance requirements. It is\n            particularly important to make an adequate risk assessment\n            and include risk mitigation measures in the project design.\n            Substituting conditionality for government commitment or\n            weak institutional capacity does not accelerate the reform\n            process. Sustainable buy-in of a controversial change\n            proposal can only be secured through extensive debates where\n            all options are explored and the stakeholders are convinced\n            of the relative pros and cons of each option. Expectation of\n            the pace of accountability reform should be realistic. In\n            many young democracies in Africa, where elected leaders\n            struggle to balance competing interests and face constraints\n            in pursuing accountability reform, it will not be realistic\n            to expect radical improvement in a short period of time.\n            Continuity of Task Team Leaders and management attention to\n            problem projects is key to success. Financial management\n            reform and procurement reform are often part of an overall\n            public sector reform program of a country, so effective\n            support to the country requires a Bank team with a broad\n            based multi-sector expertise."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - Third Fiscal Restructuring and\n            Deregulation Program Technical Assistance

Assistance\n            Project are made in support of policy reforms designed to\n            accelerate economic growth and reduce poverty; and to help\n            deepen structural reforms launched in 1995 to improve public\n            sector management, promote private sector growth, and\n            strengthen the social safety net; and to help Malawi\n            implement policy reforms, especially in the area of\n            financial management, supported by the Credit. The Credit\n            will also assist the Government in maintaining macroeconomic\n            stability by meeting financing requirements (gap) in the\n            balance of payments. In the fiscal accounts, the Credit will\n            enable the Government to maintain an overall non-interest\n            expenditure level at about 24 percent of GDP. This will\n            allow the Government to protect outlays in key social\n            sectors, while reducing domestic borrowing, thereby helping\n            to reduce inflation and interest rates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi - The Third Fiscal Restructuring and\n            Deregulation Program Project and the Third Fiscal\n            Restructuring and Deregulation Program Technical
