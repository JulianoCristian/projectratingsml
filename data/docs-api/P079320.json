Some lessons learned included: 1)\n            for proper monitoring of project progress and to take\n            corrective measures during implementation, a proper\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system should be\n            designed and instituted at the earliest, especially for\n            less-than-ideal conditions for implementation. In\n            particular, more technical assistance and regular\n            independent technical reviews are required from the start,\n            given difficulties in systematically gathering and analyzing\n            data; 2) when one of the major impacts of the project is to\n            increase rice yields in irrigated areas, activities related\n            to crop production should have been included under ARP III.\n            Along with water, other inputs such as improved seeds, as\n            well as introduction of an improved package of practices for\n            irrigated agriculture, are necessary for increasing crop\n            yields; 3) it is important at this stage to focus on\n            irrigation system maintenance and management rather than new\n            construction given current capacity constraints. For\n            accruing optimal benefits from rehabilitated irrigation\n            schemes, attention should be given to the irrigation canal\n            network designs including establishing equity in water\n            service delivery over the entire command area with the help\n            of topographical surveys and ensuring timely maintenance of\n            the scheme; and 4) the difficulties in obtaining reliable\n            information and the constantly changing environment make it\n            difficult to conduct supervision in a traditional way. A\n            closer monitoring of project activities and impact with\n            constant dialogue with Government through a field presence\n            should be considered. Sufficient supervision resources for\n            providing this level of support will be paramount."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor Leste - Third Agriculture\n            Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor Leste -
