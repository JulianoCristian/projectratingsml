The action plan proposes\n            improving the institutional and legal framework for medical\n            waste management (HCWM); improving HCWM in health care\n            facilities; training the hospital staff and the waste\n            operators; sensitizing the population to risks associated\n            with HCWM; promoting private company participation; and\n            supporting the plan's implementation. The plan\n            recommends using a modern incinerator for the national\n            hospital, using a one-combustion room incinerator (home\n            made) at the regional hospitals and health centers; and\n            using stabilized side and bottom pits at health posts. The\n            incinerator model suggested is compatible with the strategy\n            of waste segregation at the source, in order to greatly\n            reduce infectious wastes and restrict contamination of other\n            non-contagious wastes (papers, plastics, pipes, and\n            syringes, etc). All non-contaminated wastes will be treated\n            more classically (disinfection, burial, garbage dumps). The\n            system allows or the total melting of needles, the most\n            feared vectors for accidental transmission of HIV/AIDS.\n            Promoting the use of non-chlorinated plastic containers in\n            health centers--where the volume of incinerated waste is\n            expected to be insignificant--will help reduce pollution.\n            Where the use of incinerators is not the preferred option,\n            the following alternatives are proposed: chemical\n            disinfection, disposal in garbage dumps or burial within the\n            hospitals, if the appropriate area is available. The other\n            systems (autoclaving, microwaves) are not recommended\n            because they are very expensive and require highly qualified\n            staff for operation. For liquid wastes, chemical\n            disinfection is the most effective one for treating\n            infectious wastes. For this reason, it should be given\n            priority in the project. The report further recommends using\n            a combined system (disinfection and septic tank) for\n            regional and rural areas. In the central hospitals, owing to\n            the importance of water volume, it is preferable to choose a\n            physico-chemical treatment, which includes a disinfecting\n            post, although this system would require more study."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Multisector HIV/AIDS and\n            Endemic Diseases Control Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritanie - Projet\n            multisectoriel de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA et les maladies\n            end\u00e9miques : \u00e9valuation environnementale"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/03/2329598/mauritania-multisector-hivaids-endemic-diseases-control-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"MR-Multisector Hiv/Aids Control Project-Icr\n            -- P078368","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Mauritania","authors":{"authr":"Mbaye Mbengue FAYE, Nouakchott"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03051404055411"},"subsc":"Other social services,Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Medical wastes;
