The lessons learned indicate that\n            flexibility of the Bank to grant a selective project\n            extension, including a new component, even though the\n            project had already been extended twice, allowed the\n            Government of Pakistan (GOP) to develop and issue the new\n            deregulation policy. Continuous dialogue with the GOP during\n            the project was crucial for the timely implementation of\n            sector reform agenda. The sector reform agenda is\n            implemented better by a ministry responsible for a limited\n            sector portfolio. In Pakistan, the GOP's decision to\n            transfer responsibility of the telecommunications sector to\n            the Ministry of IT and Telecommunications (MOITT) provided\n            the impetus for GOP's announcement of a progressive\n            sector policy. Appointment of dedicated Project Manager is\n            necessary to ensure smooth implementation of the project.\n            Appointment of key staff of the two regulatory entities\n            should have been a condition of project processing to ensure\n            smooth start-up of the project. The establishment of new\n            regulatory entities requires considerable time and\n            resources; the project design should have been be less\n            ambitious. Given that this project was focused on regulatory\n            reform in the telecommunications sector, adequate legal and\n            economic due diligence are essential to ensure appropriate\n            project design. For procurement of complex systems like\n            National Frequency Management and Monitoring System (NFMMS),\n            the procurement process should start only after spectrum\n            policy has been announced and human resources plan is\n            available. A training program for capacity building in new\n            institutions should be designed and agreed to at the\n            beginning of the project, as it is crucial for institution\n            development. For the assessment of the project's\n            impact, it is essential to create performance indicators\n            that are relevant, measurable and easily available, and\n            establish a monitoring unit designed to collect and analyze\n            the data required to monitor the development of the project.\n            Telecommunications Sector Reform: As per international\n            experience, the introduction of a CPP regime and prepaid\n            calling cards contributed to substantial growth in the\n            mobile market. Maintaining monopoly on leased lines and\n            fixed market, blocks growth in liberalized market segments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Telecommunications Regulation and\n

support\n            the reform and efficient development of the Pakistan\n            telecommunications sector by implementing a suitable\n            regulatory framework for both public and private\n            telecommunications operators and the efficient allocation\n            and use of the radio spectrum. More specifically, the\n            project will assist in establishing the Pakistan\n            Telecommunications Authority (PTA) and the Frequency\n            Allocation Board (FAB). The project addresses the Government\n            of Pakistan's (GOP's) objectives and priorities\n            for the sector through the following components: 1)\n            technical assistance through a \"technical cooperation\n            arrangement\" with a reputable regulatory agency. Under\n            this arrangement, PTA's and FAB's priority tasks\n            will be to adopt appropriate organizational structures for\n            their entire range of regulatory activities; 2) staff\n            training for PTA and FAB will be incorporated in the\n            provision of technical assistance through the arrangement of\n            relevant courses and seminars in Pakistan, study trips\n            abroad, and training by the equipment suppliers; 3)\n            procurement and installation of an integrated radio spectrum\n            management and monitoring system designed as an integrated\n            network that will provide both administrative and technical\n            facilities and which can be easily expanded in the future as\n            the use of the spectrum increases; and 4) support to\n            GOP's sector reform program through studies of sector\n            issues tofacilitate the privatization process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Telecommunications Regulation and\n            Privatization Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Telecommunications\n            Regulation and Privatization Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/10/732862/pakistan-telecommunications-regulation-privatization-support-project","projn":"PK-Telecom Reg & Privat -- P034101","subtopic":"ICT Policy and Strategies,Public Sector Economics,Broadcast and Media,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961008010138"},"subsc":"Central Government","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Information and Communication Technologies","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Information and communications","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agriculture,autonomy,BANK\n            LOANS,Bank procedures,bidding,Capital\n            Markets,cd,CITIES,commercialization,competitive\n            bidding,competitive\n            environment,competitiveness,components,consumer\n            interests,consumer protection,consumers,data\n            transmission,economic efficiency,economic growth,Economic\n            Rate of Return,Enterprise Reform,exchange rate,Financial\n            Services,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,Housing,Institutional Development,interest\n            rate,investment banking,legislation,licenses,operating\n            efficiency,organizational structure,Packages,private\n            sector,private sector participation,Privatization,PTC,public\n            sector,public services,radio,radio frequency,radio frequency\n            management,radio frequency spectrum,radio spectrum,radio\n            spectrum management,regulatory framework,regulatory\n            systems,revenue sharing,Rural\n            Electrification,savings,taxation,technical\n            assistance,telecommunication,telecommunication\n            equipment,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            Authority,Telecommunications Company,telecommunications\n            investment,telecommunications market,telecommunications\n            operators,Telecommunications Regulation,telecommunications\n            sector,telecommunications services,Telegraph,telephone\n            connections,telephone density,telephone\n            lines,Transport,Urban Development,Water Supply,Writeoffs"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agriculture,autonomy,BANK\n            LOANS,Bank procedures,bidding,Capital\n            Markets,cd,CITIES,commercialization,competitive\n            bidding,competitive\n            environment,competitiveness,components,consumer\n            interests,consumer protection,consumers,data\n            transmission,economic efficiency,economic growth,Economic\n            Rate of Return,Enterprise Reform,exchange rate,Financial\n            Services,Fiscal Year,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,Housing,Institutional Development,interest\n            rate,investment banking,legislation,licenses,operating\n            efficiency,organizational structure,Packages,private\n            sector,private sector participation,Privatization,PTC,public\n            sector,public services,radio,radio frequency,radio frequency\n            management,radio frequency spectrum,radio spectrum,radio\n            spectrum management,regulatory framework,regulatory\n            systems,revenue sharing,Rural\n            Electrification,savings,taxation,technical\n            assistance,telecommunication,telecommunication\n            equipment,Telecommunications,Telecommunications\n            Authority,Telecommunications Company,telecommunications\n            investment,telecommunications market,telecommunications\n            operators,Telecommunications Regulation,telecommunications\n            sector,telecommunications services,Telegraph,telephone\n            connections,telephone density,telephone\n            lines,Transport,Urban Development,Water Supply,Writeoffs"}},"owner":"Information & Communication Tech (TWICT)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020230-MULTISECTOR REHABILITATION,TF021385-SINDH URBAN DEVELOPMENT II,TF020975-PRIVATIZATION OF\n            TELECOMMUNICATION SECT.","repnb":"P6380"},"facets":{}}}
