First,\n            institutional development consists of strengthening the\n            CALBIR (Cesme-Alacati Union) by setting up the Union's\n            technical and financial management systems; hiring and\n            monitoring the performance of a private operator for\n            improved water and sewerage services; and providing\n            technical assistance for a high level of project supervision\n            and on environmental issues.  Second, improving the\n            operational condition of the water supply system will\n            support hydrogeological investigations to increase water\n            production of the wells in the Ildir area; relocation of\n            wells in the Ildir area; construction of a water barrier;\n            provision of operational equipment to improve water and\n            wastewater services; and provision for urgent repairs and\n            upgrading of the water supply system.  Third, completion of\n            sewerage system will develop and improve the sewerage\n            network; construct a pre-treatment plant for the combined\n            waste water flow from Cesme
