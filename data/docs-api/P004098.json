The loan will be used to help cover the foreign\n            exchange requirements of subprojects to be financed by KLTCB\n            over the next two years. In order to encourage increased\n            mobilization of medium-term foreign commercial borrowings by\n            KLTCB, the loan will incorporate a special amortization\n            feature, which will permit the blending of Bank and\n            commercial resources. There is no special risk associated\n            with the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Eighth Development Finance\n            Corporation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea - Eighth Development\n            Finance Corporation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/11/726198/korea-eighth-development-finance-corporation-project","projn":"KR-Kdfc VIII -- P004098","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Korea, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912512075"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accelerated\n            depreciation,accounting,ADB,agriculture,assets,balance of\n            payments,Bank Lending,Bank of Korea,banking sector,banking\n            system,Basic metals,bonds,capital markets,Central\n            Bank,cities,Commercial banks,commercial loans,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,current prices,debt,Demand\n            deposits,Deposits,development banks,development\n            strategy,disintermediation,economic development,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economic sectors,employment,equity\n            investments,excess demand,exchange rate,export\n            growth,exports,financial disintermediation,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediaries,financial\n            intermediation,FINANCIAL SECTOR,Financial Structure,fiscal\n            policies,Forecasts,foreign banks,Foreign Exchange,GNP,Gross\n            Fixed Capital Formation,Gross National Product,growth\n            potential,growth rate,housing,imports,income,industrial\n            expansion,Inflation,insurance,interest rate,interest\n            rates,inventory,KDB,labor costs,Labor productivity,Land\n            Development,legislation,Lending Rates,Low interest\n            rates,maturities,maturity,nonbank financial\n            institutions,nonbank institutions,offerings,private\n            banks,productivity,Profitability,protectionism,real GNP,real\n            wages,regional banks,Resource Allocation,Resource\n            Mobilization,retained earnings,Savings,savings\n            accounts,Savings Deposits,securities,short term\n            debt,specialized banks,term finance,transaction costs,value\n            added,wages,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accelerated\n            depreciation,accounting,ADB,agriculture,assets,balance of\n            payments,Bank Lending,Bank of Korea,banking sector,banking\n            system,Basic metals,bonds,capital markets,Central\n            Bank,cities,Commercial banks,commercial loans,comparative\n            advantage,competitiveness,current prices,debt,Demand\n            deposits,Deposits,development banks,development\n            strategy,disintermediation,economic development,Economic\n            Rate of Return,economic sectors,employment,equity\n            investments,excess demand,exchange rate,export\n            growth,exports,financial disintermediation,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediaries,financial\n            intermediation,FINANCIAL SECTOR,Financial Structure,fiscal\n            policies,Forecasts,foreign banks,Foreign Exchange,GNP,Gross\n            Fixed Capital Formation,Gross National Product,growth\n            potential,growth rate,housing,imports,income,industrial\n            expansion,Inflation,insurance,interest rate,interest\n            rates,inventory,KDB,labor costs,Labor productivity,Land\n            Development,legislation,Lending Rates,Low interest\n            rates,maturities,maturity,nonbank financial\n            institutions,nonbank institutions,offerings,private\n            banks,productivity,Profitability,protectionism,real GNP,real\n            wages,regional banks,Resource Allocation,Resource\n            Mobilization,retained earnings,Savings,savings\n            accounts,Savings Deposits,securities,short term\n            debt,specialized banks,term finance,transaction costs,value\n            added,wages,working capital"}},"owner":"East Asia & Pacific Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"3115"},"facets":{}}}
