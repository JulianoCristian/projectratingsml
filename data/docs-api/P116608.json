Some lessons learned includes:\n            ownership, leadership, commitment and capacity of the\n            authorities, at the highest level, in design and\n            implementation of the policy reform agenda have been the\n            most important factor in the success of an operation.\n            Technical assistance in parallel to the operations which\n            builds capacity as well as nurture collaboration and joint\n            work improves performance. Alignment with Government\n            priorities and incremental dialogue provides valuable weight\n            to immediate and short term policy exigencies while building\n            consensus for broader and bolder reforms. The ability of the\n            team to work in close collaboration with Development\n            Partners (DPs) resulted in harmonizing results framework\n            through common policy dialogue with the Government. Close\n            coordination has proven to be an effective way to support\n            budget planning and execution. The timing of one of the\n            operations also changed to match the change in budget\n            timeframe which moved the financial year from July- June to\n            align with the calendar year. This meant that there was a\n            six month bridging gaps (i.e. a financial year of six\n            months) and to sustain the reform momentum, an operation was\n            prepared within

and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan Program operation for Mauritius\n            supports reforms which respond to two major challenges: (i)\n            the 'triple trade shock' of trade preference\n            erosion and high oil prices, and (ii) the transition from\n            low wage, low skill sugar and apparel exporter to\n            innovative, knowledge and skill based services economy. In\n            the mid-1990s a new vision began taking shape in Mauritius\n            of a higher value added, more diversified, skill and\n            knowledge intensive economy. To realize this, planners\n            recognized they will need to invest massively in human\n            capital and infrastructure, make better use of advanced\n            technologies and reform the regulatory environment to\n            harness the creativity of the private sector. Yet, little\n            was achieved in these areas during the decade which\n            followed. Instead, trend growth slowed as new sectors failed\n            to generate hoped for levels of output and employment while\n            traditional ones lost ground to increasing competition in\n            their export markets. The miracle years of the 1980s receded\n            into history. Although Fourth Development Policy Loan (DPL4)\n            is the last operation of the series, dialogue around\n            substantive policy issues is maintained and the Government\n            has requested a continuation of the DPL engagement, which is\n            currently being prepared. There are a number of specific\n            areas for deepening the existing policy dialogue through a\n            new DPL series, Information and Communications Technology\n            (ICT) reforms, trade regulatory environment, public debt\n            management, investment climate reforms, rationalization of\n            social protection, to name a few. In this process,\n            strengthening coordination with the African Development Bank\n            (AfDB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be\n            essential to improve delivery of development assistance,\n            particularly given the availability of resources from both\n            institutions for future lending. It must be noted; however,\n            that future World Bank (WB) lending in Mauritius as part of\n            a new DPL programmatic series will be subject to the WB\n            capacity to lend in the country."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritius - Fourth Trade and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritius - Fourth Trade and\n
