With that in mind, the project\n            comprises (a) rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and\n            flood protection works in all but the southwestern region;\n            (b) rehabilitation of roads and associated structures in the\n            northwestern and southwestern regions; and (c)\n            reconstruction and refurnishing of primary schools.
