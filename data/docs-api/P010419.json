The key lessons address primarily, the\n            inappropriate decision making process, particularly, the\n            political weakness, and reluctance to bring about reform\n            measures, for although there was an awareness on the need\n            for reform among financial officials, the absence of\n            committed efforts hindered the opportunity to forge the\n            reform program. Furthermore, the central coordinating unit\n            within the Central Bank, with representation from the\n            Ministry of Finance and Planning, was ill conceived, and\n            inadequate to mandate reform measures. In addition, the\n            absence of a reform framework for the financial sector, was\n            conducive to a politically biased, and ad-hoc approach to\n            reform. Under these circumstances, the Bank should require\n            the government to set up a strong coordinating unit, to\n            ensure an effective, and continuous

Sri\n            Lanka by supporting policy and regulatory reforms in the\n            financial sector; (b) to assist in domestic resource\n            mobilization for long-term investment by stimulating the\n            development of local bond markets; (c) to enable the private\n            sector to respond to the changing economic environment by\n            providing investment finance; and (d) to help deepen the\n            financial system and strengthen the key players.  Major\n            elements of the project are to:  (a) improve the policy and\n            regulatory framework, especially in areas affecting\n            mobilization of domestic resources for term investment\n            through commercial channels; (b)  a credit component for\n            financing private sector investments; and (c) a technical\n            assistance component to:  (i) provide assistance for the\n            preparation and implementation of various policy reforms\n            including establishing a viable bond market; (ii) prepare\n            the state-owned commercial banks for restructuring and\n            recapitalization; (iii) provide support for implementing new\n            accounting and auditing standards; (iv) operationalize debt\n
