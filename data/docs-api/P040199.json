The lessons\n            learned indicated that there is a need for well designed\n            outcome indictors, in-service teacher training reform,\n            community, and especially parents participation. The\n            Adjustment Program Loan (APL) is well suited for achieving\n            program objectives that require long term investments, such\n            as improvements in the quality of basic education.\n            Successful approaches tend to include allowances for\n            adaptation to improve the fit between design and the\n            particular needs of local contexts. Mexico has decentralized\n            to the states the function of providing universal basic\n            education since 1992. The basis of successful pilot programs\n            seems to be the availability of pertinent research findings\n            to orient the selection of appropriate intervention which\n            the pilot will test, as well as the necessary institutional\n            base to carry out the pilot. The relationship between\n            education and income in Mexico is positive, and economic\n            rates of returns are positive for all levels. Achievement\n            and sustainability of organizational and operational changes\n            require continuous reinforcement of ownership and\n            participation throughout project design and implementation.\n            Appropriate policies and relevant sector interventions\n            require a capacity not only to assess student learning\n            outcomes, but also to identify which factors produce the\n            best results. The design of schemes involving inter-state\n            competition needs careful planning and probing for political\n            feasibility prior to implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -

       Program Loan (APL), which supports the government's\n            compensatory education programs, as outlined in its\n            Education Development Program (PDE) through CONAFE (National\n            Agency for Educational Development), working exclusively\n            with underserved (i.e., rural, poor, indigenous, and\n            marginalized urban areas) communities. The APL further\n            improves the quality of its compensatory programs, continues\n            its policies to redress inequities in the sector, continues\n            to decentralize, and provides a smooth transition across\n            presidential administrations. There are two projects\n            components. The first improves quality in basic education by\n            1) carrying out in-service training of teachers, principals,\n            supervisors, and other administrative staff; 2)\n            strengthening school-based management at the local community\n            and school association levels; 3) strengthening supervision;\n            and 4) building and rehabilitating school infrastructure as\n            well as providing equipment and teaching aids. The second\n            component strengthens institutional capacity at the federal\n            level by strengthening the national evaluation system,\n            implementing a regional planning exercise, and setting up\n            pilot programs for migrant children, for children aged 9-14\n            in urban marginal areas, and for indigenous children in\n            regular schools.
