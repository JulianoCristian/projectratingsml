These overall objectives were\n            designed to target, in particular, the low-income population\n            and enhance the capacity of the sector. This was in line\n            with the ongoing Government strategy aimed at redressing\n            inequities in public housing intervention by further\n            addressing the segment of the Tunisian population that could\n            neither afford the type of housing produced by the public\n            sector nor obtain access to the existing housing finance\n            channels. One lesson learned from the Fourth UDP is that the\n            experience gained from previous Bankprojects (Second and\n            Third UDPs) was not used in an efficient and timely manner\n            to benefit this project. The weaknesses of the project\n            discussed in this ICR are, for the most part, a repetition\n            of the same weaknesses experienced in the previous projects.\n            The cost recovery issue remains the perfect example. The\n            findings of this ICR suggest that the project only partially\n            achieved its development objectives. If it has successfully\n            contributed to demonstrate, at both the strategic and\n            operational levels, the rational of the rehabilitation\n            policy, it did not, however, pursue with the same rigor the\n            equally important objective of land development for\n            low-income families that was one of the cornerstones of the\n            Government's housing strategy. The experience of this\n            project also suggests that active participation of the\n            target population is necessary for the success of urban\n            operations and their sustainability. Moreover, considering\n            the physical dimension of such projects, more attention\n            should be paid to the qualitative aspects of thebuildings\n            and spaces created."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Fourth Urban Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Fourth Urban\n            Development
