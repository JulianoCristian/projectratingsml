Some\n            lessons learned included: in a sector-wide approach (SWAP),\n            the leadership of development partners requires a mix of\n            \"hard skills\", \"soft skills\", and\n            flexibility. The World Bank proved to play an important role\n            in supporting fiduciary processes and participating in the\n            technical dialogue. While there is agreement that ownership\n            is an important determinant of success, the concept of\n            ownership is often seen as a dichotomous process either\n            there is ownership or not. The World Bank expressed repeated\n            concerns about the government's ownership of the\n            program, for example, the use of consultants to prepare the\n            macro plan and concerns that the government initially raised\n            about a SWAP. No sector is an island and it is important for\n            sector programs to coordinate with efforts to strengthen\n            public administration and governance. A SWAP is an\n            evolutionary process that requires flexibility and\n            adaptation to succeed. With support, governments can\n            transform monitoring and evaluation (M and E) systems from a\n            pro forma system of collecting data to a powerful tool for\n            monitoring and decision making."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Primary Education\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Primary\n            Education

           moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            usefulness of an education sub-sector approach. Under the\n            project, the Government took increased ownership and\n            activities began to be somewhat mainstreamed and integrated\n            into the regular system activities. Harmonization of\n            management, planning, procurement, accounting and reporting\n            arrangements helped to reduce Government of Bangladesh (GOB)\n            transaction costs significantly. Need for a robust\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E): during the early phases\n            of PEDP II, it was difficult to obtain sufficient focus on\n            results and timely reporting. Much of the information\n            available centered around progress of activities instead of\n            key implementation reforms and outcomes. Development partner\n            coordination: use of the results-based financing approach,\n            the pooling of development partners funding, and use of the\n            Government's systems for PEDPII resulted in the\n            development partners having more harmonized implementation\n            arrangements and joint planning towards key program results.\n            Implementation support: a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) that\n            uses a common results-based approach with Government and\n            development partners, and implements through regular\n            government systems requires joint responsibilities for\n            supervision within an integrated Implementation Support Plan\n            (ISP) defined before the SWAp is launched and ideally,\n

Second Primary Education\n            Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Second Primary\n            Education Development Project is to improve quality,\n            equitable access, and efficiency in primary education\n            through a sub-sector program approach. Specifically, the\n            program will assist the Government to: (a) improve the\n            quality of teaching and learning, and raise student\n            achievement; (b) increase access to schooling for the\n            disadvantaged; and, (c) strengthen planning and management\n            of primary education, including establishing a national\n            monitoring and evaluation system for primary education. This\n            program is in line with both the Country Assistance Strategy\n            (CAS) and sectoral goals, and the Interim Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper (PRSP), which aims to develop a\n            cost-effective, and better managed primary education system.\n            The first component will improve quality through\n            organizational development and capacity building ,including\n            program management, and monitoring and evaluation. It\n            comprises three subcomponents, aimed at supporting\n            investments which will result in improved educational\n            management, including good governance of the primary\n            education system, with a focus on increasing authority and\n            accountability at district, upazila, and school levels while\n            addressing fiscal, and supervisory irregularities in the\n            sub-sector. The interventions proposed in the second\n            component represent the core quality inputs of the project,\n            and provide the framework for systemic and institutional\n            change, interventions that are designed to ensure program\n            schools meet the agreed primary school quality level\n            criteria. Other interventions, linking capacity building to\n            program implementation, would include strengthening primary\n            education apex institutions such as the National Academy of\n            Education (NAPE), and the National Curriculum and Textbook\n            Board (NCTB), support for Primary Training Institutes for\n            initial teacher training, and Upazila Resource Centers for\n            in-service teacher training. The third component consists of\n            a summary of all physical facilities requirements under the\n            other components, and includes support for improving\n            existing ones, and providing new infrastructure, facilities,\n            furnishings and equipment. Finally, the fourth component\n            focuses on promoting, and facilitating access to quality\n            schooling for those children who have never attended formal\n            primary schooling, or who have dropped out, mainly due to\n            poverty. It also includes capacity building interventions\n            which are essential for institutionalizing strategies, and\n            processes critical for ensuring access for children\n            disadvantaged by poverty, and special needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Primary Education\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second

Environmental aspects will be considred in both\n            design and construction/reconstruction of buildings,\n            latrines, and tube wells. Since arsenic has contaminated the\n            tube well water, remedial measures will be taken. Engineers\n            will sink/re-sink the tube wells into arsenic free layers\n            and re-test the water of the new tube wells with the help of\n            the health department to ensure safe drinking water in the\n            primary schools. In geographical locations where arsenic has\n            contaminated the tube wells, alternate measures will be\n            taken. For example deep-set hand tube wells will be sunk in\n            alluvial normal areas; half deep-set hand tube wells with\n            Tara pumps will be used in high alluvial areas; ring wells\n            will be used in hilly areas; and deep-set hand tube wells at\n            designated lower depths will be used in saline-affected\n            coastal areas. Water testing laboratories have been\n            established in different districts and regional levels to\n            test water quality--for bacteria as well as arsenic. For\n            sanitation, twin pit latrines (alternating pit use) will\n            ensure one pit is dry and made germ-free. The dried-up\n            residual matter can be used as green manure. Building design\n            and construction will incorporate environmental practices.\n            They will ensure soundness to resist cyclone and tidal\n            surges, withstand earthquakes of moderate magnitude,\n            facilitate cross-ventilation, and minimize dampness with\n            pre-cast hexagonal ventilators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Primary Education\n            Development Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Second Primary\n            Education Development Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/08/2530794/bangladesh-second-primary-education-development-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"BD-Bangladesh - Primary Education\n            Development Project II -- P074966","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Sanitation and Sewerage,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03100204005721"},"subsc":"Primary education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aquifer,arsenic,bacteriological\n            quality,Calcium,Coastal\n            areas,COD,Conductivity,Construction,drinking\n            water,Electrochemical,Environmental Practices,ground\n            water,Hardness,heat,high tide,Iron,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Water,latrines,lime,manure,Oxygen,PH,Phosphate,pit\n            latrine,PVC,safe drinking water,Safe Water,saline\n            water,Salinity,Sanitation,School Sanitation,SEPTIC\n            TANK,Water Quality,water quality testing,Water\n            Resource,water source,Water supply,water table,water testing,wells,Zinc"},"1":{"cdata!":"aquifer,arsenic,bacteriological\n            quality,Calcium,Coastal\n            areas,COD,Conductivity,Construction,drinking\n            water,Electrochemical,Environmental Practices,ground\n            water,Hardness,heat,high tide,Iron,Irrigation,Irrigation\n            Water,latrines,lime,manure,Oxygen,PH,Phosphate,pit\n            latrine,PVC,safe drinking water,Safe Water,saline\n            water,Salinity,Sanitation,School Sanitation,SEPTIC\n            TANK,Water Quality,water quality testing,Water\n            Resource,water source,Water supply,water table,water testing,wells,Zinc"}},"owner":"S.A.
