Lessons learned suggest\n            the following. Transparent grant programs - based on agreed\n            international standards, or quality assessment and peer\n            review - can change academic culture and resource\n            allocation, thus contribute to improving the quality, and\n            efficiency of education outcomes. Nonetheless, block grant\n            funding mechanisms need to be supported by socialization to\n            develop a climate of acceptance, by the recording of\n            implementation experience to establish a body of supporting\n            evidence, and finally, by the reform of the legal and\n            regulatory framework. In addition, the central project\n            coordination unit proved essential in supporting a\n            decentralized implementation, and was fully effective in its\n            procurement, and financial management capacity, as did the\n            national level institutions, which ensured the integrity of\n            the selection process, the high quality of the proposals, as\n            well as the effective monitoring and evaluation block grant\n            programs. However, dissemination and feedback mechanisms\n            must be incorporated into project design in order to develop\n            examples of best practice, and support systemic change,\n            while reforming the structure, and governance of\n            institutions of higher education, requires changing the way\n            the money flows in the institution. In this case project\n            financing provided the incentive for such change at the\n            study program level, and allowed the universities to\n            experiment with innovative ways in restructuring the study programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Higher Education Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Higher Education\n            Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2412129/indonesia-higher-education-support-project","projn":"ID-Development Of Undergrad.
