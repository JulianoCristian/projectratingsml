Under the first project about 14,000 sq.\n            km. of deeper offshore acreage has been offered to the oil\n            industry for bidding. The proposed project would concentrate\n            on the shallow water area and would consist of: (i)\n            collection, processing and evaluation of new seismic data in\n            the shallow offshore area, extending from the coastline to\n            the 20 meter water depth; (ii) evaluation of this new data\n            and its integration with existing information; (iii)\n            preparation of a report on the shallow water area and its\n            promotion within the industry; (iv) negotiation of\n            exploration and production contracts in this area with oil\n            companies; (v) monitoring the work programs of these\n            companies once exploration begins; (vi) institutional\n            support and training; and (vii) preparation of a petroleum\n            pricing study. The project would help determine the\n            existence of economically exploitable oil deposits in the\n            shallow water area and is expected to attract foreign\n            capital for intensive exploration work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Second Petroleum Exploration\n            Promotion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea-Bissau - Second Petroleum\n            Exploration Promotion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/02/723054/guinea-bissau-second-petroleum-exploration-promotion-project","projn":"GW-Oil Expl.
