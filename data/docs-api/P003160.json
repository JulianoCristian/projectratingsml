The station will have an\n            installed capacity of 600 MW, to be provided by four 150 MV\n            turbo generating units, the first to be in operation by June\n            1974 and the fourth unit by June 1975. The station will be\n            designed so that capacity could be subsequently increased to\n            900 MW."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zambia - Kariba North Hydroelectric Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zambia - Kariba North\n            Hydroelectric Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1970/06/1556399/zambia-kariba-north-hydroelectric-project","projn":"ZM-Kariba North Power -- P003160","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Strategic Debt Management,Public Sector Economics,National Governance,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Zambia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903172962"},"subsc":"(Historic)Hydro","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Administrative Arrangements,administrative\n            costs,Authority,Bank loans,Borrower,budget surplus,Central\n            Government,Commitment,commitment\n            charge,commitments,competitive bidding,contractors,Cost of\n            living,creditors,creditworthiness,debt,debt service,Debt\n            service ratio,Development\n            Finance,disbursements,execution,expenditure,expenditures,external\n            debt,External Public Debt,financial rate of return,Foreign\n            aid,foreign exchange,foreign exchange reserves,government\n            loans,grace period,Guarantor,housing,licenses,LOAN,loan\n            agreement,loan agreements,loan\n            finance,MfA,ministers,Nations,outstanding debt,private\n            sector,Public Debt,Public Sector,Public utilities,Rate of\n            Exchange,redemption,repayment,representatives,Roads,savings,short\n            term borrowing,specialized agencies,tax,taxation,technical assistance,telecommunications,transport"},"1":{"cdata!":"Administrative Arrangements,administrative\n            costs,Authority,Bank loans,Borrower,budget surplus,Central\n            Government,Commitment,commitment\n            charge,commitments,competitive bidding,contractors,Cost of\n            living,creditors,creditworthiness,debt,debt service,Debt\n            service ratio,Development\n            Finance,disbursements,execution,expenditure,expenditures,external\n            debt,External Public Debt,financial rate of return,Foreign\n            aid,foreign exchange,foreign exchange reserves,government\n            loans,grace period,Guarantor,housing,licenses,LOAN,loan\n            agreement,loan agreements,loan\n            finance,MfA,ministers,Nations,outstanding debt,private\n            sector,Public Debt,Public Sector,Public utilities,Rate of\n            Exchange,redemption,repayment,representatives,Roads,savings,short\n            term borrowing,specialized agencies,tax,taxation,technical assistance,telecommunications,transport"}},"owner":"WB Off:Maputo - Southern AFR 2 (AFCS2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"P843"},"facets":{}}}
