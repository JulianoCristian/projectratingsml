development impacts. Lessons point at the\n            Integrated Social Protection Support, part of a continuum of\n            actions implemented by the Government in the social, with\n            support from the Bank, through previous, and expected sector\n            work, adjustment loans, and investment operations. This\n            support created the conditions for the rationalization, and\n            integration of social protection functions, and to improve\n            effectiveness of service delivery to poor, and vulnerable\n            populations, particularly, the internally displaced\n            populations. The project focused on appropriate structural\n            reforms which the Government was willing to implement to\n            improve the institutional underpinnings of the social\n            sector. Such was the case of the consolidation of the health\n            sector reform (Law 100 of 1993), creating the insurance\n            system for the poor (subsidized regime), which the\n            Government was willing to rapidly expand. Strategic choices\n            and trade-offs are required, particularly in the design of a\n            sector adjustment loan, which must balance the establishment\n            of policy conditions, with a realistic assessment of the\n            expected objectives and what can be accomplished in the\n            available timeframe. The project thus benefited from a\n            smaller number of conditions, and prioritization of those\n            conditions, facilitating preparation and follow-up\n            activities. Nevertheless, specific output or target\n            indicators should be considered to evaluate the long-term\n            impact of reforms in selected social protection programs,\n            and services provided to the poor, and vulnerable\n            populations. The fast-track timing of this operation led to\n            a focus mainly on process, and input indicators, preventing\n            the inclusion of measurable outputs as conditions. Further\n            lessons suggest that project design would benefit from a\n            prioritization of identified problems in the Policy Matrix\n            (though with a limited focus on inputs and processes in such\n            Policy Matrix), so that only when major reforms are\n            operational, would a discussion of indicators be appropriate."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
