Both World Bank and Borrower performances are rated\n            highly satisfactory. Lessons learned include the following:\n            The operation provides a good example of successful\n            coordination between privately-owned consumer cooperatives\n            (PBSs) and a government oversight/quasi-regulatory\n            institution (REB). The system has now gained considerable\n            maturity which is demonstrated by the ability to replicate\n            new cooperatives and find capable staff in rural areas to\n            man technical and management functions. The ability to\n            mobilize these cooperatives to take over comparatively large\n            networks previously managed by and deal with consumers used\n            to fraudulent practices speaks highly of the sustainability\n            of the system. Another lesson to be learned is the\n            importance of training rural technicians (wiremen, linesmen,\n            etc.) to strengthen the rural private sector to sustain\n            private sector led construction work and to help in widening\n            the consumer base. Major lessons could also be learnt from\n            the loss reduction, rehabilitation, and regularization\n            exercise underway in the taken-over area. However, it will\n            be some time before the final results could be made known\n            and conclusions drawn on the success of various alternatives\n            being followed by different PBSs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
