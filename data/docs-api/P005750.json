Some\n            lessons learned included: the benefits of a comprehensive\n            project design can be outweighed by complexity, difficulty\n            in implementation, and resources being spread too thin, even\n            in a middle-income country like Tunisia. The effectiveness\n            of complex projects implemented by multiple actors can be\n            undermined unless the project management unit (or its parent\n            agency) has sufficient authority to proactively coordinate\n            key implementation agencies. Attempts to move from public to\n            private provision of services can be undermined if there is\n            not sufficient attention to beneficiary, needs, perceptions,\n            and

- Agricultural Support Services Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Agricultural Support\n            Services Project for Tunisia were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory.  Some lessons learned included: the project\n            concentrated too much on cooperatives as a vehicle to help\n            farmers. It neglected private marketing intermediaries,\n            which were already providing some of the desired services\n            (advice and help on variety selection, inputs, cultivation,\n            harvest, post harvest handling, help on marketing, pest\n            control, and in some cases credit). An analysis should have\n            been done to identify several value chains for each product.\n            Then each sector should have received assistance, beginning\n            at the farm level, by looking to the end market and finding\n            out exactly what buyers would pay for. Farm level actions\n            could have been subsidized in part at the outset for newly\n            created value chains, moving toward cost recovery after a\n            transition period for the private sector value chains as\n            they became well established. Competitiveness of Tunisian\n            products is a matter of both quality and price. Quality\n            standards are now better controlled thanks to several\n            activities of the project through partnerships between\n            importers and Tunisians processors, improved regulations,\n            better laboratory infrastructure, and information\n            management. The remaining challenge is to maintain a price\n            that is competitive for both the increasingly demanding\n            local market and the export market. However, the marketing\n            of agricultural produce is currently characterized by\n            controls of some food prices at the wholesale level,\n            administrative controls of marketing margins and\n            insufficient clarity in wholesale market transactions. This\n            environment does not provide the right incentives for\n            producers to address quality issues, as quality is often\n            associated with higher costs that they might not be able to\n            recuperate. Unless the current marketing practices do not\n            change, improvements in quality as a result of better\n            service delivery will not materialize."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -

Following the\n            country's environmental legal, and regulatory\n            framework, adverse impacts, and mitigation measures\n            stipulate the following.

The use of pesticides, and fertilizers\n            may endanger natural resources, and human health: guidelines\n            will be prepared for an optimal use of these products, and,\n            information on integrated pest management will be\n            disseminated. Genetic losses due to artificial insemination\n            may occur: coordination with national institutions, should\n            identify strategic programs for the conservation of\n            biological native diversity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisie - Projet de Renforcement des\n            Services d'Appui a l'Agriculture : etude\n            d'impact sur l'environnement"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisie - Projet de renforcement\n            des services d'appui \u00e0 l'agriculture :\u00e9tude\n            d'impact sur l'environnement"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/05/1121290/tunisie-projet-de-renforcement-des-services-dappui-lagriculture-etude-dimpact-sur-lenvironnement","projn":"TN-Agricultural Support Services Project -- P005750","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Tunisia","authors":{"authr":"Jaafar Friaa, Expert Environnement"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01060604005223"},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,Central government administration,Animal production","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment; Agricultural\n            services; Agricultural research; Legal & regulatory\n            framework; Soil erosion; Water pollution; Effluents;\n            Environmental impact; Monitoring criteria; Research\n            planning; Water supply systems; Vegetative soil; Toxicity of\n            pesticides; Toxicological testing; Sewage treatment systems;\n            Soil contamination; Solid wastes; Lubricants; Natural\n            resource management; Environmental guidelines; Pest\n            management; Information dissemination; Genetic diversity;\n            Artificial insemination; Biodiversity conservation"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF025459-PHRD-AGRICULTURE SUPPORT SERVICES","repnb":"E468"},"1346287":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/05/1346287/tunisia-agricultural-support-services-project","available_in":"French,English","fullavailablein":[{"lang":"French","entityid":"000012009_20040804124453","node_id":"1346287"}],"url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/05/1346287/tunisia-agricultural-support-services-project","new_url":"2001/05/1346287/tunisia-agricultural-support-services-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/06/29/000094946_01060904004529/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/06/29/000094946_01060904004529/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"7063","datestored":"2002-11-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2001-05-25T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Agricultural Support Services Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Agricultural Support Services\n            Project aims to develop, on a pilot basis, organizational\n            structures for producers that represent their needs and\n            interests; and improve the institutional capacity and\n            quality of agricultural services delivered by public and\n            private institutions and producer organizations; and improve\n            the flow of information for all stakeholders.
