ODS (ozone depleting substances)\n            production and use of primary CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)\n            were phased out through the implementation of the\n            sub-projects and legislative enactment. In addition to\n            meeting some of the incremental costs of phase-out, this\n            GEF-funded (Global Environment Facility) project enabled\n            appropriate Western technologies to be identified and\n            introduced into the country. Despite these positive\n            outcomes, the performance of the 3R component (recovery,\n            reclamation, and recycling) was unsatisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) Establishing and\n            improving the proper legal and regulatory framework, and the\n            institutional system were essential. 2) All sub-projects\n            experienced a \"learning curve\" as ideas and\n            technologies imported from the West needed adapting before\n            they could be transferred. 3) Earlier legislation\n            encouraging the recovery of refrigerants by imposing a heavy\n            excise duty on CFCs backfired to some degree.

Specifically this project will assist the Czech\n            Republic to: a) initiate the phase out of the production of\n            chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); b) phase in the operation of a\n            national network for refrigerant recovery/reclamation/\n            recycling; and c) support applied engineering efforts to use\n            ODS substitutes in manufactured goods, thereby reducing the\n            immediate and future needs for regulated subjects. There are\n            5 sub-projects including: a) engineering assistance for ODS\n            production phaseout; b) design and operation of CFC\n            refrigerant reclamation facilities and establishment of\n            refrigerant recovery capacity in the national network of\n            servicing companies; c) introduction of non-ODS refrigerant\n            in the commercial, industrial and refrigerated transport\n            sectors; d) introduction of non-ODS insulation technologies\n            in cold room panel manufacturing; and e) setup of a project\n            management unit (PMU)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Czech Republic - Technical Support and\n            Investment Project for the Phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Czech Republic - Technical\n            Support and Investment Project for the Phaseout of Ozone\n            Depleting Substances"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/08/698122/czech-republic-technical-support-investment-project-phaseout-ozone-depleting-substances","projn":"CZ-Ods Phaseout (Gef) -- P008377","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Montreal Protocol,Global Environment Facility,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"GEF Project Document","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment","count":"Czech Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961219144032"},"subsc":"Other industry","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Health, Nutrition and Population,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aerosol propellants,aerosols,air,Bank\n            procedures,Carbon,carbon tetrachloride,cash flow\n            analysis,CFC,CFCs,chlorofluorocarbons,co,debt,developed\n            countries,emissions,environmental issues,environmental\n            regulations,Expenditures,financial risk,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foams,funds flow,HCFC,HFCs,imports,INCREMENTAL\n            COSTS,insulation,legislation,mandates,MFMP,Montreal\n            Protocol,Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the\n            Ozone Layer,ODS,operating costs,operating losses,Ozone,Ozone\n            depleting potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,ozone\n            layer,Ozone Layer Depletion,ozone layer\n            protection,pollution,producers,profitability,Reclamation,Recycling,refrigeration,REGULATORY\n            FRAMEWORK,retirement,Retrofitting,rigid\n            foams,safety,savings,solvents,stratospheric ozone\n            layer,technical assistance,transfer\n            payments,Transport,UNEP,United Nations Environment Programme,Workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"aerosol propellants,aerosols,air,Bank\n            procedures,Carbon,carbon tetrachloride,cash flow\n            analysis,CFC,CFCs,chlorofluorocarbons,co,debt,developed\n            countries,emissions,environmental issues,environmental\n            regulations,Expenditures,financial risk,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foams,funds flow,HCFC,HFCs,imports,INCREMENTAL\n            COSTS,insulation,legislation,mandates,MFMP,Montreal\n            Protocol,Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the\n            Ozone Layer,ODS,operating costs,operating losses,Ozone,Ozone\n            depleting potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,ozone\n            layer,Ozone Layer Depletion,ozone layer\n            protection,pollution,producers,profitability,Reclamation,Recycling,refrigeration,REGULATORY\n            FRAMEWORK,retirement,Retrofitting,rigid\n            foams,safety,savings,solvents,stratospheric ozone\n            layer,technical assistance,transfer\n            payments,Transport,UNEP,United Nations Environment Programme,Workers"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF028661-GET-CZECH TECH.
