Some lessons learned included: while\n            using existing Government channels and structures for\n            implementation was consistent with longer-term public sector\n            management objectives, reliance solely on existing civil\n            service staff was insufficient to address capacity\n            constraints. APL II foresaw greater recourse to contracted\n            staff. Experience revealed that cash and food transfers met\n            different needs at different times of the year. Design of\n            APL II sought greater flexibility in resource programming\n            between cash and food. A financial management assessment was\n            done during appraisal. The main strength identified was the\n            avoidance of setting up parallel systems. Some weaknesses\n            identified include delays in reporting, shortage of\n            qualified accountants and auditors, limited focus on\n            internal audit, and delayed staffing of the external audit\n            function. Means to strengthen the multi-donor framework\n            developed in First Adaptable Program Loan (APL I) were\n            identified. Coordinated semi-annual project reviews were\n            placed as dated covenants of the project and the donor\n            coordination unit was reinforced."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Second Productive Safety Nets\n            (APL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia -

For a\n            quarter-century, images of severe drought and widespread\n            starvation have become relentlessly linked with Ethiopia.\n            Each day, they manage hunger, extreme hardship, and multiple\n            sources of uncertainty. Most vulnerable households work as\n            subsistence farmers on small plots of degraded land, and are\n            subject to the vicissitudes of weather. International\n            Development Association (IDA) financed Productive Safety Net\n            Program (PSNP) which launched in 2005 to help the country\n            shift from an emergency relief system to a more effective\n            development-oriented safety net. Up to 192 million paid\n            workdays have been generated through community projects that\n            addressed some of the roots of food insecurity by\n            rehabilitating severely degraded land and creating\n            productive community assets such as terraced fields, feeder\n            roads, and small-scale irrigation systems. Ethiopia faced a\n            potentially devastating crisis from a vicious circle of\n            drought, food shortages and high food prices. An estimated\n            12 million people were affected. The project drew on the\n            Bank's global experience in safety net design and\n            collaborated with the government in adapting insights to the\n            Ethiopian context. The project played a vital role in\n            warding off famine in 2008. As a result food security\n            improved among participating households, as measured by\n            self-reported caloric intake. Agricultural productivity\n            increased, community water supplies were improved and family\n            health benefited. The government of Ethiopia provided\n            in-kind contributions through program supervision and\n            management support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Etiop\u00eda - Obras p\u00fablicas y donaciones\n            generan red de protecci\u00f3n social"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia -
