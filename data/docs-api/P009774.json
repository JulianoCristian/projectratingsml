The head regulators for the three irrigation\n            canals taking off from the barrages would be replaced by new\n            structures. The project would also include the development\n            of a Drainage Master Plan for the entire Mahanadi delta,\n            including the implementation of selected works identified\n            under the Master Plan, a program of water management pilot\n            operations and the construction of staff accommodation and\n            other buildings required for the supervision and management\n            of the project. The risk associated with the project, apart\n            from those normally inherent in irrigation projects in\n            India, is that one or both of the old weirs might collapse\n            while the new barrages are being constructed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Mahanadi Barrages Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Mahanadi Barrages Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/10/726215/india-mahanadi-barrages-project","projn":"IN-Mahanadi Barrages -- P009774","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Water Supply and Systems,Engineering,Water Conservation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912511769"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Extension,Agricultural Inputs,Agricultural\n            Production,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,Audits,average\n            yields,Barrages,canal irrigation,canal\n            systems,canals,catchment,catchment area,cereals,civil\n            engineering,clay,coal,Construction,covering,covers,creeks,crop,crop\n            rotation,Cropping,crops,dam,development\n            projects,discharge,diseases,ditches,diversion,Drainage,drainage\n            ditches,drainage systems,drainage works,drains,dry\n            season,embankments,Engineering,Engineering\n            Design,Equipment,erosion,excess capacity,extension\n            services,falling,farm,farmer,farmers,farms,fertilizer,fish,flood\n            control,flood\n            protection,flooding,floods,Foodgrains,groundnut,groundnuts,Groundwater,heavy\n            monsoon,High Yielding\n            Varieties,hoists,housing,humidity,hydraulic\n            jump,Hydrology,incomes,irri,Irrigation,jute,labor\n            force,laboratories,leakage,limestone,manganese,marketing,mechanical\n            engineering,minerals,nitrogen,oilseeds,Paddy,pest\n            control,pests,potatoes,power generation,pressure,private\n            mills,produce,programs,pulses,Quality Control,rabi\n            crops,rainfall,Rice,Rice Research,rivers,rural\n            development,sand,sea,Seed,Seepage,shoals,silt,Soils,structures,Transport,uniform\n            flow,velocity,water distribution,Water losses,Water\n            Management,water resources,Water Supply,watercourses,Weirs,wells,winds,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Extension,Agricultural Inputs,Agricultural\n            Production,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,Audits,average\n            yields,Barrages,canal irrigation,canal\n            systems,canals,catchment,catchment area,cereals,civil\n            engineering,clay,coal,Construction,covering,covers,creeks,crop,crop\n            rotation,Cropping,crops,dam,development\n            projects,discharge,diseases,ditches,diversion,Drainage,drainage\n            ditches,drainage systems,drainage works,drains,dry\n            season,embankments,Engineering,Engineering\n            Design,Equipment,erosion,excess capacity,extension\n            services,falling,farm,farmer,farmers,farms,fertilizer,fish,flood\n            control,flood\n            protection,flooding,floods,Foodgrains,groundnut,groundnuts,Groundwater,heavy\n            monsoon,High Yielding\n            Varieties,hoists,housing,humidity,hydraulic\n            jump,Hydrology,incomes,irri,Irrigation,jute,labor\n            force,laboratories,leakage,limestone,manganese,marketing,mechanical\n            engineering,minerals,nitrogen,oilseeds,Paddy,pest\n            control,pests,potatoes,power generation,pressure,private\n            mills,produce,programs,pulses,Quality Control,rabi\n            crops,rainfall,Rice,Rice Research,rivers,rural\n            development,sand,sea,Seed,Seepage,shoals,silt,Soils,structures,Transport,uniform\n            flow,velocity,water distribution,Water losses,Water\n            Management,water resources,Water Supply,watercourses,Weirs,wells,winds,yields"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"3111"},"facets":{}}}
