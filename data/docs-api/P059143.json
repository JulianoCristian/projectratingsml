The additional credit will\n            help finance the costs associated with scaling up the Urban\n            Micro-credit component of the project to reach a hitherto\n            underserved segment of the urban poor, which are the poor\n            rickshaw-pullers affected by a ban on Non-Motorized\n            Transport (NMT) in certain Dhaka roads. The additional loan\n            will be passed-on by the Government as a grant to the apex\n            microfinance institution called the Palli Karma-Sahayak\n            Foundation (PKSF) for implementation of the expanded\n            activities that will scale up the project's impact and\n            development effectiveness.

Bangladesh aims to\n            continue the International Development Association's\n            (IDA's) support for poverty alleviation through\n            microcredit. The Project has five main components. 1) The\n            mainstream microfinance - rural microcredit component will\n            continue to support horizontal and vertical expansion of\n            rural microcredit, to respond to the unmet demand and the\n            need for larger loans per borrower, respectively. 2) The\n            urban microcredit component will support scaling-up of urban\n            microcredit activities and will cover up to 270,000 urban\n            borrowers. 3) The hard-core poor component will target\n            program expansion, change the current microcredit delivery\n            system, and diversify financial services. 4) The\n            microenterprise lending component will help progressive or\n            graduate microcredit borrowers or microentrepreneurs who\n            have entrepreneurial talents to scale-up their activities.\n            5) The institutional development component will strengthen\n            Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation's (PKSF) and small and\n            medium-size partner organizations' (POs) capacity to\n            increase outreach, broaden the range of financial services\n            benefiting the poor and hard-core poor, and improve\n            POs' creditworthiness and sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Second Poverty Alleviation\n            Microfinance
