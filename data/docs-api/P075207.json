Some lessons learned included:\n            The Borrower\u0092s or Implementing Agencies (IA\u0092s) initiative\n            has a greater chance to succeed than one promoted by\n            International Financial Institutions (IFIs). Public\n            Enterprise Roads of Serbia\u0092s\u0092 (PERS\u0092s ) commitment to the\n            introduction of Performance-based Contracts (PBCs) was\n            critical to the early success of the intervention. When such\n            ownership and commitment exists, the Bank should work\n            closely to support the government. In this case, the Bank,\n            together with European International Bank (EIB) and European\n            Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) who have\n            showed commitment to the same agenda, should continue\n            helping the Government of Serbia (GOS) realize that the\n            cost-effectiveness of PBCs can be achieved through: (i)\n            breaking up the monopoly of regional contractors who receive\n            routine maintenance contracts under traditional unit-based\n            contracts without competition; and (ii) introducing more\n            output-based services in the PBCs. Recommendations of road\n            safety audits should be directly incorporated into the road\n            designs at the earlier stages of the design process.\n            Contractors should have staff specifically responsible for\n            implementation and monitoring of Environmental Management\n            Plans (EMPs), in order to ensure compliant environmental\n            safeguards implementation. Closer collaboration with the\n            ministries responsible for utilities should be achieved\n            prior to the start of the civil works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia - Transport
