The\n            three micro-finance institutions are Credit Rural (a rural\n            community-based credit scheme), Credit Mutuel (a credit\n            union-type of structure that caters to small businessmen,\n            traders, and civil servants), and Le Programme Integre pour\n            le Developpement de l'Entreprise (PRIDE) (a traditional\n            micro-finance nongovernmental organization focusing on\n            women-owned informal activities and enterprises). There are\n            three components. The first sets up a micro-finance support\n            and monitoring unit which manages a general\n            performance-based institution building program that trains\n            central bank staff in financial and institutional\n            management, and builds model credit unions. The second\n            component consists of specialized assistance for each\n            institution in the form of investments, specialized\n            consulting, and performance-based incentives. Specifically,\n            capacity-building for the staff of the three institutions\n            will entail advisory assistance and short-term consultants,\n            training, and equipment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Microfinance Capacity-Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Microfinance\n            Capacity-Building
