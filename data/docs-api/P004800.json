Lessons reinforce that while\n            ownership, and commitment by the Borrower is crucial, it\n            remains difficult to ascertain these two factors, beyond the\n            needed funds. One way to maximize these two factors, could\n            be by minimizing staff changes, on both the Bank and\n            Borrower sides, but involving greater number of people on\n            the borrower's side in project preparation, through\n            workshops, and other means of information, to reduce\n            dependence on few key staff members, and gain support for\n            project objectives, regardless of the fact that project\n            preparation may become more time consuming, and expensive.\n            Moreover, coordination of action plans by a number of\n            agencies does become cumbersome; rather, commitments on a\n            few agreed-upon actions by a few agencies, instead of a\n            myriad, disconnected actions by many agencies, would be\n            simpler, and should make possible to match the\n            country's, and implementing agencies' objectives,\n            with the Bank's strategic objectives. Further lessons\n            suggest the need for an early agreement on procurement\n            procedures; to ensure implementation of a strong financial\n            management; to ensure that terms of reference reflect the\n            needs of the agency, and its management capability; and, to\n            ensure flexibility, and relevance in the design of capacity\n            building

major inter-city raodways\n            by widening to 4-lane standards; 2) resurface and restore\n            existing roads to allow them to carry increasing traffic and\n            heavier vehicles; 3) provide technical assistance and\n            trainng; and 4) support the procurement of various related\n            types of equipment for the Ministry of Transport and\n            Communications and other agencies.  The major environmental\n            issues associated with the project are\n            transportation-related air pollution and noise, and the\n            potential for involuntary resettlement of people along or\n            within the existing inter-city roadway.   The sectoral\n            environmental assessment is primarily aimed at describing\n            the environmental documentation requirements, legal and\n            regulatory framework, and the institutional capabilities of\n            affected agencies.  Suggestions are made for warrented\n            project definition and screening procedural changes,\n            mitigation planning, training, and other institutional\n            aspects of the
