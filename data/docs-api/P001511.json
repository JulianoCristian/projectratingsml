The Bank played\n            an important role in the implementation of the project.\n            Madagascar has made significant progress in its shift from a\n            command economy, with almost two decades of economic\n            decline, to a market oriented economy. From 1988 to 1990,\n            economic recovery continued at a reasonable pace, although\n            Madagascar still remains highly dependent on external aid.\n            Efforts must be made to stimulate private savings and\n            investment among both households and enterprises and to\n            expand exports. ITPAC was successful in carrying forward the\n            reform effort in Madagascar and setting the stage for\n            renewed interest in Madagascar by domestic and foreign\n            private investors. The program design lesson from this\n            experience is that when multiple objectives are to be\n            achieved, the pace is dictated by the slower actions to be\n            implemented. Public enterprise reform, although an important\n            objective, had an impact on trade reform which was advancing\n            on a faster track. Lapses in macroeconomic management and\n            lower than expected export expansion, together with the\n            delay in tranche release, contributed to the reemergence of\n            foreign exchange constraints and threatened the\n            sustainability of the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Industry and Trade Policy\n            Adjustment Program

to\n            increase the efficiency and productivity of the economy,\n            reallocate resources to the more productive sectors,\n            reorient these sectors towards exports and a greater use of\n            domestic inputs, and stimulate the revival of the efficient\n            segments of the industrial sector. Following a significant\n            effort in the area of economic stabilization and some\n            initial policy improvements at the sectoral level, the\n            cornerstone of the policy package is a major trade\n            liberalization supported by exchange rate adjustment. The\n            broadening of a market-oriented system for allocating\n            foreign exchange would be accompanied by the removal of\n            protective import prohibitions, rationalization of the\n            import tariff structure and further price decontrol. The\n            policy package would also include measures in the areas of\n            public investment, public enterprises and the banking\n            system. The quick-disbursing proceeds of the Credits would\n            increase the total amount of foreign exchange available to\n            finance imports by all economic agents under a liberalized\n            import regime, thereby supporting the movement towards a\n            market determined foreign exchange allocation system."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Industry and Trade Policy\n
