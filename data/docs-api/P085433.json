Lessons are as\n            follows. 1) Lending in the social protection sector - The\n            launching of the Unified System of Beneficiary Selection was\n            a significant achievement for the Government. However, for\n            it to reach its full potential, and ensure objective\n            targeting of social safety net programs, the system may need\n            to be adapted to address specific requirements of particular\n            agencies. The census of beneficiaries also needs to be\n            carried out with a transparent sampling plan (to avoid any\n            appearance of favoritism of urban/less poor areas over poor\n            rural areas). Also of importance are the local technical\n            expertise, technical capability, and, the complexity of the\n            issue of undocumented families and individuals. 2) Lending\n            in a crisis situation - the experience of this operation\n            demonstrates that in a crisis situation, Bank lending can\n            effectively achieve short-term crisis alleviation, along\n            with modest advances on medium policy actions. Flexibility,\n            setting realistic expectations and a frank appraisal of\n            risks as input to program design (the establishment of loan\n            conditions), and, collaboration across sectors and with\n            other major donors are critical to success in Bank lending\n            under these conditions, although moral hazard remains a risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic -

Social Crisis Response\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objectives of the Social Crisis\n            Response Adjustment loan Project are to help the Dominican\n            Republic cope with the current economic and social crisis\n            and to stimulate overdue and continuing reforms in the\n            social and electricity sectors. The Dominican Republic in\n            early 2003 entered a period of financial crisis,\n            precipitated b y a major bank failure, followed b y\n            macroeconomic contraction, rapid currency depreciation and\n            inflation, increasing incidence of  electricity blackouts as\n            power companies could not afford to import fuel, and social\n            impacts in the form of substantial real declines in\n            household incomes and cutbacks in social services benefiting\n            the poor. The poor are most vulnerable to the fall in real\n            incomes, as they lack the resources to absorb the higher\n            cost of  living. This has led to growing social tensions in\n            the form of  protests and violence. The Dominican Republic,\n            once one of  the fastest growing economies  in the region,\n            now faces an untenable fiscal situation and is at risk of\n            further social unrest. The loan would support government\n            actions in three areas. First, it would help build the\n            response capacities and performance of  social and\n            electricity programs through improved targeting of\n            resources to the poor, the protection of  key social and\n            electricity programs in the 2004 budget, and steps to\n            accelerate the inclusion of  the large group of\n            undocumented Dominicans. Second, it would support a rapid\n            response program in the electricity sector to \"keep the\n            lights on\" during the current period of  social\n            tensions. And third, it would provide a stimulus for medium\n            term reforms in the social and electricity sectors in such\n            areas as targeting mechanisms, program evaluation, health\n            reform, and electricity sector sustainability.   The first\n            category of  risk is governance, in the context of  the\n            upcoming May 2004 Presidential elections, a period that\n            could involve the misuse of  social programs for election\n            campaign purposes. Linked to that risk is that of  ad hoc\n            budget reallocations during the fiscal year, from protected\n            to unprotected programs. The second category of risk is that\n            of non- compliance with actions for the two floating\n            tranches, including maintenance of  a satisfactory\n            macroeconomic framework. Finally, there is the risk of  a\n            surge in civil disturbances that would undermine consensus\n            for social and electricity sector reforms, taking the\n            country into deeper crisis. The loan is expected to be\n            disbursed during the first six months of  2004 in three tranches."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Social Crisis Response\n            Adjustment Loan
