Some lessons learned included: the\n            project provides the lesson that complex designs, especially\n            those with many overlapping activities, are more difficult\n            to understand and manage, and measure. Many of the grants\n            were awarded to and managed by specialists from one or two\n            academic or research institutions, indicating that the\n            process was less than competitive. In addition, there was a\n            tendency for many grants to be research-driven rather than\n            farmer-driven and thus not always entirely responsive in\n            addressing the farmers' problems. The development of a\n            credit system geared to agricultural producers is difficult\n            when a subsidized interest program is also in operation, and\n            makes it difficult to encourage modifications in operational\n            practices by banks and Mutual Fund Institution's\n            (MFIs). The project clearly showed that formation and\n            development of cooperatives and associations is a long-term\n            undertaking requiring continuing efforts, often longer than\n            the project period."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Small Scale\n            Commercial Agriculture Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

Herzegovina will focus\n            activities in the Southeastern part of the country. The area\n            has a Mediterranean climate, which is favorable for early\n            production of fruit and vegetables, has potential for\n            on-farm irrigation resources and continues to have\n            traditional trade with neighboring countries. This area was\n            impoverished by the war but has the potential to respond\n            readily to a revitalization program. The project will 1)\n            encourage farmers to adopt more productive and profitable\n            production systems and increase the marketability of their\n            surplus production; 2) create a dynamic commercial\n            agriculture by strengthening linkages among farmers and\n            markets through the promotion of private sector investment,\n            and credit for farming, agro-processing and trading; 3)\n            facilitate the export of agriculture products, through\n            information and technical assistance; and 4) support\n            measures and investments to strengthen the physical and\n            institutional infrastructure of rural communities. The\n            project components are: a) market integration; b) private\n            agribusiness support; c) commercial farmers development; and\n            d) project management. The increased production and\n            productivity resulting from the project will increase\n            farming and other rural incomes, and reduce unemployment and
