There are\n            both project specific and general lessons to be learned to\n            ensure that such approaches are improved in the future in\n            the following areas: (1) Multi-sectoral projects: The\n            project assumed that the institutional capacity was similar\n            for the health and education sectors. This was not the case\n            in this project. From the start support for education policy\n            changes received strong support from the UNMIK education\n            office, and the capacity built there sustained project\n            activities. Less trained manpower available in the health\n            sector and changes in Ministry staff affected the ability of\n            the government to carry out the policy changes anticipated.\n            (2) Choice of Project Activities: The project activities\n            were overcomplicated and over sophisticated for the\n            timeframe. There was no need to include social protection as\n            a component. In addition, a pragmatic blend of policy and\n            praxis might have ensured more ownership. Preparation for\n            the school grant scheme undertaken at the end of the project\n            reinforced the message of decentralization which the project\n            was sending on education. Similarly the introduction of\n            training for public health care physicians and nurses\n            towards the end of the project contributed not only to the\n            impact of the project on policy formation but also health\n            care delivery.  Research in the Western world on introducing\n            innovation into government recognizes that this can come as\n            a response to crisis. This project took such an opportunity.\n            However key factors in the successful introduction of\n            innovations include:  (a) Keeping them simple in approach;\n            (b) Making them easy to execute; (c) Shooting for quick\n            results; (d) Making them appealing to the widest\n            constituency possible and (e) Keeping them apolitical.\n            Application of the above principles to project design might\n            have increased impact and enhanced its ultimate\n            sustainability.  A central Project Implementation Unit for\n            both components would have facilitated coordination and\n            oversight, particularly when there were changes in government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo -

There are three main project\n            components. This component focuses on education: 1) It\n            assists the policy design, implementation planning, and\n            training of a comprehensive decentralized system of\n            education funding; and develops management systems and\n            related software aimed at capturing essential school data\n            and information, and builds an information culture. 2) It\n            strengthens governance and the institutional capacity of the\n            University of Pristina by providing technical support to\n            legislate the university's mandate and operating\n            procedures, and develops its strategic planning and\n            management capacity. 3) It develops the staff's\n            capacity to define modern standards and assess student\n            performance. 4) It develops the education department's\n            governance and management structures. The second component\n            develops a health and welfare strategy through 1) designing\n            and implementing mechanisms for the financing system; and\n            providing technical assistance to develop a social\n            protection strategy; 2) strengthening the capacity of the\n            health insurance fund; and 3) preparing an implementation\n            plan for restructuring the health sector.
