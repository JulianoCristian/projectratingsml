The Education For All Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Education For All Project for Guinea\n            was moderately unsatisfactory with a substantial risk to\n            development outcome. Both the Bank and the Borrower\u0092s\n            performance in the project was moderately unsatisfactory.\n            Key changes made to the project through the following four\n            restructurings include: revision of results framework to\n            focus on primary education, scaling up of activities for\n            primary education, additional financing revision of PDO and\n            some revision of the results framework to align with project\n            activities, and an extension of the closing date by six\n            months. The following six lessons were learned from this\n            project: (1) Strategic sequencing is critical in ensuring\n            objectives can be achieved. Although many of the project\u0092s\n            objectives have been achieved, a number of them might have\n            been achieved in a timelier and more efficient manner if\n            they had been more carefully selected and appropriately\n            sequenced. (2) Student learning achievement levels which\n            have been evaluated regularly by national structures, often\n            in collaboration with regional institutions or specific\n            programs can be used to inform policy. (3) One of the\n            important building blocks for undertaking difficult reforms\n            (e.g., related to human resources, budgeting, etc.) is the\n            involvement of institutional staff intimately familiar with\n            the issues rather than relying on a parallel project unit.\n            (4) The Bank\u0092s swift engagement in periods following a\n            crisis can bring important dividends. (5) While consultancy\n            services and technical assistance (TA) supported under the\n            project had a positive impact on achievement of outcomes,\n            the lack of skills transfer to staff from government\n            institutions could inhibit the development of long-term\n            capacity within the institutions. (6) In instances where a\n            project\u0092s life extends far beyond what was originally\n            envisaged, in-depth and periodic evaluations may provide the\n            necessary data to effectively evaluate the project\u0092s\n            progress towards achievement of the PDO as well as to\n            undertake measures which further increase the likelihood\n            that the project will achieve its intended development goals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - The Education For All Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - The Education For All
