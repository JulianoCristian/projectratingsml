They often are of a political economy nature, as\n            well as technical; and both kinds of risks need to be\n            recognized and planned for. In Indonesia, reluctance to\n            introduce accompanying regulations to new laws was an\n            indicator that new institutional arrangements had yet to\n            mature; and that government was not yet ready to firm up its\n            options for defining new responsibilities. Conventional\n            government processes (budget processes, fiduciary controls)\n            should be amenable to adjustment, especially when the\n            emphasis is on piloting new methods. The purpose of piloting\n            is to learn and adapt, which requires some flexibility. All\n            three projects were piloting new complex reforms in an\n            unsettled environment. All three were closely sequenced,\n            offering limited opportunity for transmitting learning from\n            one project to another. Projects introducing new\n            institutions must be seen as opportunities for learning and\n            improving, and sequencing should have that in mind."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, and Third Phase\n            of the Provincial Health Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia -

Some lessons\n            learned included: stakeholders welcomed the opportunity to\n            conduct bottom-up planning under the project and many\n            believed that establishing the capacity to conduct evidence\n            based planning was a major achievement of Health Work\n            Services (HWS). Participants at the central level felt that\n            the Minister of Health (MOH) components will have been\n            stronger had there been more concerted efforts on behalf of\n            MOH during project preparation. Complex projects like HWS\n            require a lot of learning and adaptation, particularly\n            during the first years of implementation, and a longer\n            implementation period is warranted. Workshop participants at\n            all levels agreed that clear objectives and indicators are\n            important for guiding project implementation and to keep it\n            focused. Central level participants mentioned that the\n            objectives of the central components were not well defined.\n            The unclear role of the province level at the beginning of\n            decentralization contributed to the rather loose description\n            of the provincial component of the project. Participants\n            confirmed that districts appreciated being invited to\n            participate in designing the district component during\n            project preparation. Participants agreed that performance\n            during implementation was better where the project appraisal\n            document (PAD) clearly described the scope of project

This report\n            focuses on specific measures to safeguard isolated\n            vulnerable peoples, or IVP. The latter are individuals or\n            communities including but not limited to indigenous people\n            that share similar characteristics such as being outside the\n            mainstream of political and economic power, physical\n            isolation, language and cultural barriers, or part of an\n            ethnic minority. By targeting the welfare of IVP the project\n            addresses health care for some of the poorest segments of\n            the society. Approaches to developing the capacity of the\n            government to collect data on IVPs as a discrete group will\n            be incorporated into the project's implementation. The\n            project will ensure that measures are incorporated into\n            proposals that involve stakeholders in project design and\n            implementation, including training for participatory\n            planning. The report also advocates that community groups be\n            provided an opportunity to give feedback directly to the\n            Bank on implementation issues to enhance transparency. It is\n            expected that improved transparency and community\n            participation will reduce the incidence of\n            \"unofficial\" charges and user fees. Infrastructure\n            will be developed as appropriate in remote areas to improve\n            access for isolated communities. Options to be considered\n            include the construction of more health centers and the use\n            of mobile health units. Additionally, the project will\n            consider options for increased recruitment and training of\n            health workers from IVP communities as well as developing\n            culturally appropriate approaches to working with IVP. By\n            improving the quality of health care providers, it is\n            expected that there will be an opportunity to build trust\n            among communities. Lastly, the project will support\n            developing culturally appropriate communications materials\n            in order to improve the access of IVP to health information;\n            option for incorporating traditional beliefs, medicines, and\n            health care practices into the training of health care\n            workers will be considered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Health Workforce and Services\n            Project : indigenous peoples plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Health Workforce and\n            Services Project : indigenous peoples plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/01/2128861/indonesia-health-workforce-services-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","projn":"ID-Health Workforce & Services (Php 3)\n            -- P073772","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Health Systems Development & Reform,Gender and Health,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Indonesia","authors":{"authr":"Indonesia"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03020404013312"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Tertiary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"burden of disease,communities,community\n            groups,community participation,decision\n            making,districts,expenditures,health care,health care\n            financing,health care providers,health care services,health\n            centers,health insurance,health outcomes,health\n            providers,health services,health status,health system,health\n            workers,Health\n            Workforce,isolation,medicine,medicines,midwives,pregnant\n            women,primary health care,public health,public\n            sector,quality of health care,service delivery,social\n            issues,Social Marketing,traditional medicine,villages,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"burden of disease,communities,community\n            groups,community participation,decision\n            making,districts,expenditures,health care,health care\n            financing,health care providers,health care services,health\n            centers,health insurance,health outcomes,health\n            providers,health services,health status,health system,health\n            workers,Health\n            Workforce,isolation,medicine,medicines,midwives,pregnant\n            women,primary health care,public health,public\n            sector,quality of health care,service delivery,social\n            issues,Social Marketing,traditional medicine,villages,workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF030308-CANADIAN (GEN) CTF FY03 -\n            SOCIAL PROTECTION,TF030305-CANADIAN (GEN) CTF FY03 -\n            EDUCATIONAL FOR ALL,TF050430-PHRD-INDONESIA: IMPROVING\n            DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH WORK FORC-,TF040965-INDONESIA: HEALTH WORK FORCE\n            AND SERVICES,TF040924-INDONESIA: HEALTH WORK FORCE\n            AND SERVICES,TF026831-PHRD-INDONESIA: IMPROVING\n            DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH WORK FORCE","repnb":"IPP31"},"facets":{}}}
