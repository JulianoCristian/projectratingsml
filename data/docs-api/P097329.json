Some lessons learned included: civil works in\n            public sector reform programs can be risky so it will be\n            advisable to finance them selectively and support them\n            appropriately. Different components could be combined into\n            one project where there is a compelling case to do so and\n            where there are strong mechanisms for overall coordination\n            and oversight. It is important that projects have more\n            realistic and measurable targets based on the implementation\n            context and relevant international experience. The successes\n            in this project illustrate the important results that can be\n            achieved while working within the existing reform space.\n            However, the public institutions' long-term\n            effectiveness may be undermined if broader reforms in the\n            enabling environment are not also undertaken, such as\n            revised statistical legislation or the enactment of an Audit\n            Act. In future operations, mechanisms for stronger policy\n            dialogue could be built in through, for example, a component\n            on information sharing in investment lending or through a\n            Development Policy Loan or a results-based lending\n            instrument.
