The\n            Bank played a supporting role in the fulfillment of the\n            project. Several lessons can be learned from this project:\n            Changes in the institutional structure, and management\n            approach of established government-controlled institutions,\n            can only be achieved by: strong commitment, support on the\n            part of the government, and substantial supervision efforts\n            of the Bank. Appropriate development of project\n            implementation, and follow-up capacity of individual\n            financial institutions, remains an important objective of\n            industrial development lending operations and continues to\n            require serious attention during supervision. The\n            achievement of the Pakistan Industrial Credit (PICIC)'s\n            medium-term objectives is not only sensitive to overall\n            economic developments in Pakistan, but will also depend on\n            further improvements in PICIC's management systems and\n            staff resources. Continuation of competent management with\n            clear operational goals and strong leadership are vital to\n            the institution's full recovery from its past period of
