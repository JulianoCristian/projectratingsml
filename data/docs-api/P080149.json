Decentralized Infrastructure\n            Reform and Development Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Decentralized\n            Infrastructure Reform and Development Loan Project for\n            Mexico were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory, and sub Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned include: multi-sector Sector\n            Wide Approach (SWAp) operations may not be practical. They\n            require significant effort to design and supervise, and\n            potentially dilute the Bank's ability to provide good\n            policy advice and technical assistance. Moreover, SWAps\n            require an in-depth understanding of the sector and a team\n            of Bank specialists to engage in policy issues within each\n            sector, which was generally missing in the Project due to\n            resource constraints. Output-Based Disbursement (OBD)\n            provides a useful tool for facilitating implementation of\n            well-defined limited projects, as local procurement\n            procedures deemed acceptable to the Bank can be used and\n            there is a focus on outcomes. When an OBD approach is used\n            for large-scale sector-wide operations it is more difficult\n            to find output indicators that both meet the requirements of\n            the Bank's OBD policy and are useful for measuring\n            broad sector performance. The project underscored the\n            importance of not only improving sector environmental\n            management (transport, water, and housing) but also working\n            with the environmental agency responsible for regulating the\n            sectors. The project leaves the state with a legacy of good\n            practice at the sector and state level both are necessary to\n            sustain the environmental management system. SOP is\n            under-investing in periodic maintenance of the state road\n            network. Investments in periodic maintenance should be more\n            of a priority for SOP and the state government due their\n            high levels of economic return. This is common problem among\n            public works agency and usually requires a higher level\n            political commitment and supervision to ensure that periodic\n            maintenance is a priority. Continued focus on water company\n            sustainability although the performance of municipal water\n            companies has improved under the project, many are still in\n            a precarious financial condition and subject to local\n            political interference. The additional responsibility of\n            wastewater treatment will put additional strain on the water\n            companies, and make it even more important to improve their\n            operational performance and financial condition."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
