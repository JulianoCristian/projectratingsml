Lessons convey that often times, and\n            contrary to current Bank practices of starting an operation\n            with institutional reforms, to increase the possibility of\n            downsizing, followed by capacity building, it may be\n            advantageous to pay attention to the client's\n            arguments. In this case, the government demanded immediate\n            actions, to take full advantage of the pluralistic momentum\n            of changes, and guided this approach, to reach a successful\n            capacity building stage. However, it was felt that some\n            missing elements within the economic management component,\n            could have been useful at the outset of the project, such as\n            the need to address budget formulation, and execution, as\n            well as emphasizing transparency, and accountability.\n            Finally, assessing the impact of the project, particularly\n            the development impact of capacity building, may be\n            difficult to assess in the short term, and, the long-term\n            impact can only be measured in terms of increased\n            productivity, and efficiency over many years. However, it is\n            possible - and necessary - to monitor accuracy, and quality,\n            i.e., through benchmarks of effectiveness, least-costs, and\n            benefits of the training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Public Sector Reform and\n            Capacity Building Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cape Verde - Public Sector Reform\n            and Capacity Building Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/01/1003152/cape-verde-public-sector-reform-capacity-building-credit-project","projn":"CV-Pub.
