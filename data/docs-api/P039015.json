Lessons learned from the\n            project: The problems faced at the beginning of the project\n            emphasize the need for thorough project preparation and\n            design. A great deal of effort is needed, in terms of time,\n            expense and expertise, to establish the necessary platform\n            of reformed policy, legislation, and guidelines to ensure\n            the success of processes such as introducing private sector\n            participation into urban water service provision, shifting\n            to a demand responsive approach in rural water, and\n            establishing a water resources strategy. The impact of and\n            need for strong project management, good departmental\n            leadership and political support in such reform / pioneering\n            projects cannot be overemphasized."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - First National Water\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - First National Water\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/04/6789061/mozambique-first-national-water-development-project","projn":"MZ-Natl Water 1 (Fy98) -- P039015","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Mozambique","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060515103707"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sanitation","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to urban services, Administrative\n            capacity, asset holding company, bulk water, bulk water\n            supply, Capacity building, Central government, city water,\n            city water supplies, construction, contract management,\n            drainage works, Flood Risk, high levels, hygiene, hygiene\n            promotion, international river basins, international waters,\n            management of water, management of water supply, management\n            of water supply systems, municipal staff, municipalities,\n            NATIONAL WATER, National Water Policy, national water\n            resources, national water resources management, National \u00b7\n            Water, National \u00b7 Water Policy, performance indicators,\n            piped water, point sources, private operator, private\n            operators, programs, Project Management, provision of\n            sanitation services, public health, Public Works, rainfall,\n            riparian, riparian states, river basin, river basins,\n            Rivers, Rural Water, Rural Water Supply, safety equipment,\n            sanitation infrastructure, sanitation management, Sanitation\n            Policy, sanitation services, Sanitation strategy, Sanitation\n            Water, service delivery, small communities, small scale\n            providers, small towns, stakeholder participation,\n            sustainable services, sustainable water, sustainable water\n            supply, urban sanitation, Urban Water, urban water sector,\n            urban water services, Urban Water Supply, urban water supply\n            systems, wastewater, wastewater generation, water board,\n            water companies, Water Department, WATER DEVELOPMENT, water\n            infrastructure, Water Law, water management, water points,\n            Water Policy, water projects, Water resource, Water resource\n            management, Water Resources, Water Resources Management,\n            water schemes, Water Sector, water sector development, water\n            service, water service provision, water services, water\n            supplies, water supply activities, water supply service,\n            water supply services, water system"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Anglophone (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF022176-PHRD 2-PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM I/PSDPS,TF024310-USTDP CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF029560-PHRD-NATIONAL WATER DEVELOPMENT 1,TF033349-MOZAMBIQUE - NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES,TF033445-MOZAMBIQUE - WATER RESOURCES,TF034135-MOZAMBIQUE - NATIONAL WATER\n            RESOURCES MGMT & DEV.

There are\n            five components in this project. First, institution building\n            and policy development will develop a regulatory and\n            monitoring framework and capacity, and undertake studies for\n            development of water sector policy. Second, preparation for\n            private sector management of urban water supply will support\n            the bidding process for the private sector management of the\n            water supply systems of the five cities, design and\n            construct emergency works, prepare plans for the provision\n            of sanitation services in the five cities. Third, rural\n            water supply and sanitation (RWSS) will reorient and reform\n            the management and implementation of RWSS. Fourth, water\n            resources management will develop a national water resources\n            management strategy.

The project has\n            three components: i) urban and peri-urban water supply; ii)\n            rural water and sanitation; and iii) water resources\n            management. This project will involve little resettlements.\n            However, the study does provide guidance for future\n            resettlement planning, as well as standard environmental\n            requirements. During construction, noise, dust and air\n            emissions should be minimized by using modern equipment.\n            Measures must be taken to prevent oils and chemicals from\n            seeping into the ground or into water courses. Used oils and\n            lubricants should be collected and disposed out of the\n            working area. Trenches should be carefully backfilled to\n            avoid later subsidence and erosion. During operation, intake\n            water quality should be monitored regularly to minimize the\n            risk of unknown substance or minerals adversely affecting\n            drinking water. Significant leakage of pipes will cause\n            erosion and flooding, and should be prevented by automatic\n            monitoring of pressure of flow."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - National
