Project\n            restructuring is for the Romania, project, loan to (i) drop\n            two activities and correspondingly, cancel \u00806.7 million from\n            the loan, (ii) modify one intermediate results indicator,\n            and (iii) extend the current closing date by six months,\n            from September 25, 2012 to March 25, 2013, resulting in a\n            cumulative extension of 30 months from the original closing\n            date of September 30, 2010.  This will be the third\n            restructuring of the project and in line with BP 13.30,\n            seeks RVP approval given the cumulative extension exceeding\n            24 months beyond the original closing date. The project was\n            restructured two times.  The first restructuring was\n            conducted in September 2010 to (i) align the Project\n            Development Objective (PDO) to more precisely reflect the\n            current post-accession EU integration challenges facing the\n            borrower; (ii) discontinue the food safety (whose\n            unsatisfactory performance was a risk to achievement of\n            PDOs); (iii) revise project activities; (iv) revise the\n            results framework and monitoring; and (v) extend the project\n            closing date by 12 months to September 30, 2011.  In\n            addition, an amount of \u00800.8 million was cancelled from the\n            loan and the loan amount became \u008040.6 million. The project\n            has progressed since the second extension, albeit at a\n            slower pace than expected mainly because of the slow\n            decision making process in the Ministry of Agriculture and\n            Rural Development (MARD) triggered by frequent changes of\n            high-level management (ministers and deputies).  In\n            addition, the continued financial crisis prevented the\n            allocation of sufficient budget funds to the Project in the\n            first half of 2012, slowing down payments and thus\n            implementation of ongoing contracts and procurement of new\n            contracts. However, following budget adjustments, MARD has\n            provided all funds required for completion of the ongoing contracts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Modernizing Agricultural Knowledge\n
