Much remains to be done to improve the\n            business environment and attract private investors. The\n            economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks and even\n            more dependent on cotton than it was before the reform\n            program was initiated. Poorly implemented changes in the\n            sector have compromised the 1998-99 crop year, and made more\n            difficult the implementation of a reform process aimed at\n            empowering producers. Poor management in the energy sector\n            aggravated a power shortage in 1998, due to a drought in the\n            region. Despite increased budget allocations to priority\n            sectors, the delivery of essential services has not\n            significantly improved. Implementation of ongoing projects\n            in education, health, and transport in support of this\n            objective is far behind schedule. The changes supported by\n            the project are likely to be sustained. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are rated satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include the following: A two-tranche operation was\n            not the most appropriate instrument in a difficult political\n            environment. A series of single-tranche operations would\n            have increased leverage and flexibility. Staff continuity on\n            both sides contributed to a good quality dialogue, even when\n            the political environment was not conducive to reform. An\n            attempt should have been made to quantify the program's\n            objectives, and a monitoring and evaluation system should\n            have been put in place."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Third Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Third Structural\n            Adjustment Credit

to strengthen the supply response to the\n            devaluation of the CFA franc and to consolidate refroms\n            initiated since 1990. In particular, the devaluation has\n            provided Benin the opportunity both to accelerate refroms\n            that were constrained by the previous overvaluation - such\n            as lower import tariff protection and privatization of\n            previously uncompetitive enterprise - and to generate a\n            great supply response from the measures taken since 1990.\n            This credit will support the Government's efforts to\n            maintain a substantial real depreciation through appropriate\n            macroeconomic policies, assure a strong supply response to\n            the devaluation, and improve the delivery of essential\n            public services required for higher growth in the medium\n            term. The adjustment package proposed under the operation\n            consists of a an acceleration of fundamental policy reforms\n            in two areas. First, the credit will support improved\n            incentives for private sector development through further\n            simplification and rationalization of foreign trade\n            taxation, a deeper restructuring of domestic indirect and\n            direct taxation, additional changes in the regulations\n            governing commercial activity, investment and the labor\n            market, and the public enterprise divestiture. Second, it\n            will support improved management of public resources and\n            delivery of public services by restructuring current\n            expenditures, improving public investment programming and\n            execution, and reorganizing key ministries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Third Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin -
