About 500 ha of coconut will be established by a\n            public estate at Muara Wahau. As both sites are forested,\n            commercially valuable timber will be recovered during land\n            clearing. The major risks associated with the project are\n            poor coordination of implementation and reduced crop yields\n            due to poor soil quality."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Fourth Transmigration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Fourth Transmigration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/04/725689/indonesia-fourth-transmigration-project","projn":"ID-Transmig.Iv(E.Kalima -- P003818","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Forestry,Agribusiness,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Rural Development","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912585444"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            exports,Agricultural extension,Agricultural\n            Inputs,agricultural laborers,agricultural\n            machinery,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,annual\n            crops,Audits,beans,biomass,cassava,chipping,cloves,cocoa,Coconut,coconuts,coffee,concession,Cooperatives,copra,crop,crop\n            development,crop pests,Crop Production,crop\n            yields,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,cultivars,cultivation,diseases,dry season,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equipment,erosion,exchange\n            rate,FARM,FARM INCOME,Farm Incomes,farm\n            work,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,Fertilizer,fertilizers,field\n            trials,fishing,Food Crops,food production,food security,food\n            supply,foodcrops,forest,Forestry,foundation seed,fruit\n            trees,funds for research,gardens,government\n            regulations,grasslands,groundnuts,groundwater,Housing,imports,inflation,Land\n            Clearing,land development,Land\n            Use,legumes,Livestock,logging,maize,marginal\n            lands,marketing,mixed farming,natural\n            resources,pepper,Pesticide,Plant\n            Protection,plantations,Planting,population\n            growth,poultry,produce,Production\n            Costs,rattan,reclamation,Resource Management,rice,rice\n            procurement,seed,seedlings,Seeds,size of farms,soil\n            conservation,soil surveys,Soils,soybean,sugar,sustainable\n            use,Timber,timber marketing,Timber Utilization,tree\n            crops,trees,vegetables,vegetation,Village Water Supply,water supply,Yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            exports,Agricultural extension,Agricultural\n            Inputs,agricultural laborers,agricultural\n            machinery,AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,annual\n            crops,Audits,beans,biomass,cassava,chipping,cloves,cocoa,Coconut,coconuts,coffee,concession,Cooperatives,copra,crop,crop\n            development,crop pests,Crop Production,crop\n            yields,Cropping,Cropping\n            Patterns,cultivars,cultivation,diseases,dry season,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equipment,erosion,exchange\n            rate,FARM,FARM INCOME,Farm Incomes,farm\n            work,farmers,farming,farming\n            systems,farms,Fertilizer,fertilizers,field\n            trials,fishing,Food Crops,food production,food security,food\n            supply,foodcrops,forest,Forestry,foundation seed,fruit\n            trees,funds for research,gardens,government\n            regulations,grasslands,groundnuts,groundwater,Housing,imports,inflation,Land\n            Clearing,land development,Land\n            Use,legumes,Livestock,logging,maize,marginal\n            lands,marketing,mixed farming,natural\n            resources,pepper,Pesticide,Plant\n            Protection,plantations,Planting,population\n            growth,poultry,produce,Production\n            Costs,rattan,reclamation,Resource Management,rice,rice\n            procurement,seed,seedlings,Seeds,size of farms,soil\n            conservation,soil surveys,Soils,soybean,sugar,sustainable\n            use,Timber,timber marketing,Timber Utilization,tree\n            crops,trees,vegetables,vegetation,Village Water Supply,water supply,Yields"}},"owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"3943"},"facets":{}}}
