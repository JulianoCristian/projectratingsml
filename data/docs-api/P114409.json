Some lessons learned\n            include: the project design should allow flexibility\n            regarding the types of field investigation works that can be\n            financed. Thus, if types of field investigation works are\n            strictly prescribed, then a project restructuring will be\n            required, which may delay implementation of the project due\n            to the time required for restructuring and subsequent\n            probability of missing the favorable weather conditions.\n            Procurement of technically sophisticated geo-technical\n            studies should be initiated as early as possible. Given the\n            technically complex nature of some geo-technical studies and\n            non- availability of specialized firms in the local market\n            as well as possible limited interest of internationally\n            renowned firms, it is advisable to start procurement of such\n            studies as early as possible. Otherwise, the consultant\n            selection might result in very few or no bids for such\n            consultancy services, which may require rebidding and delay\n            project

The development of renewable energy in\n            Armenia was of triple importance. Firstly, it used local\n            energy sources, secondly it used renewable energy sources\n            and thirdly, it used clean sources of energy. Armenia\n            Renewable Energy Project designed the scheme for small\n            hydropower stations, and developed model business plans and\n            guidelines for the renewable energy sector. Ninety Two\n            hydropower stations were constructed under the project which\n            would meet six percent of the internal demand for\n            electricity.

Project\n            development objective for Armenia is to assess the\n            feasibility of exploratory drilling of the geothermal site\n            with the estimated highest geothermal potential; this\n            objective continues to be relevant. The extension is\n            necessary to allow completion of the second phase\n            investigation works for Karkar site, which has been\n            identified as more promising based on first phase\n            investigations. Second phase investigation works include\n            three dimensional Magneto-Telluric (MT) sounding,\n            interpretation of the results of the three dimensional MT\n            sounding, supervision of the implementation of the\n            three-dimensional MT sounding, and assessment of economic\n            and financial viability of Karkar site. Second phase works\n            were delayed because the project originally envisaged a\n            three-dimensional seismic survey as part of second phase\n            works, which was replaced by the three-dimensional MT\n            sounding as explained in the restructuring paper of June 14,\n            2010. Given this and the seasonal nature of investigation\n            works, an extension until September 30, 2012 is necessary to\n            complete second phase works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Second GeoFund\n            Geothermal Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/12/13235339/armenia-second-geofund-geothermal-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"AM-Geofund 2: Armenia Geothermal Project -- P114409","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Information Security & Privacy,Renewable Energy,Housing & Human Habitats,Educational Technology and Distance Education,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Education,Communities and Human Settlements,Energy,Information and Communication Technologies,Transport","count":"Armenia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20101213232451"},"subsc":"Renewable energy","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Communities and Human Settlements,Energy,Information and Communication Technologies,Transport","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"ABBREVIATIONS, ACRONYMS, CONTENTS, drilling,\n            GEOTHERMAL, GEOTHERMAL PROJECT, geothermal site, MT, sites, sounding"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF093653-GEOFUND 2 ARMENIAN GEOTHERMAL PROJECT","repnb":"58391"},"facets":{}}}
