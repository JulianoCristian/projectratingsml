In the case of a\n            reactivation of the Bank's full program in Madagascar,\n            there will be a need to move from a project approach to a\n            scaled-up national safety net system capable of providing\n            longer-term support to vulnerable households. This support\n            will need to be more sustained and predicable, rather than\n            the one-off interventions in responding to emergency that\n            was the focus of the EFSRP. A self-standing Social\n            Protection operation should therefore be considered under\n            IDA 17. The EFSRP also helped implement anti-cyclone\n            building norms in the country, particularly for social\n            infrastructure. Given the high rate of destruction,\n            rebuilding with mitigation in mind will have high returns\n            for the country in terms of safety and sustainability of\n            this infrastructure. Cash-for-work had a measurable and\n            immediate effect on stabilizing and improving food\n            consumption. A combination of geographical and\n            community-based targeting backed by the development of\n            guideline proxy-means indicators was able to target benefits\n            to food insecure households. To further develop this\n            targeting approach, the FID is now working with the Bank on\n            developing a proxy means test that would be used to validate\n            potential beneficiaries based on their family composition,\n            assets, etc. thus adding an objective way of measuring\n            households' poverty status. This information will also\n            benefit the construction of a beneficiary database,\n            presently developed by Intervention Fund for Development (FID)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar
