The project's objectives were to: (a)\n            increase agricultural productivity and cropping intensity\n            and therefore rural incomes of about 43,000 small-scale\n            farmers; (b) reduce market risks by smoothing out production\n            throughout the year; (c) develop the technological base for\n            the future development of La Mojana Region; (d) improve cost\n            recovery from public sector investment in irrigation; and\n            (e) strengthen community Participation. Although the\n            Bank's performance was deficient during the early\n            stages of project design and implementation, its'\n            overall performance is considered satisfactory. Both the\n            Government (Borrower) and INAT (Implementing Agency)\n            performed deficiently, though both should be recognized for\n            positive contributions. The key lessons learned from the\n            project are as follows: (a) Bank support for the work of a\n            dedicated group within an organization which has many\n            weaknesses can lead to some success; (b) Borrower ownership\n            and commitment is fundamental for effective implementation\n            and sustainability; (c) SSI projects require a high level of\n            attention to technical, economic, institutional and social\n            issues in addition to engineering; (d) an engineering-minded\n            irrigation agency with a narrow mandate and limited\n            experience in agricultural matters is unlikely to have\n            sufficient capacity to ensure that on-farm development\n            activities are adequately carried out; and e) greater\n            involvement of Water User Associations and the regional\n            irrigation offices in all stages of project implementation\n            should be reinforced in order to improve project impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Small Scale Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Small Scale Irrigation
