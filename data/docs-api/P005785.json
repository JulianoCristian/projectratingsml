It\n            will also assist the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries\n            in the establishment of extension centers in the border\n            governorates of Saadah and Hajjah. The project comprises:\n            (a) infrastructure development (civil works, equipment and\n            supplies) needed to support credit activities and extension\n            services; (b) technical assistance and training in several\n            key areas of CACB operations; and (c) funds to assist CACB\n            to expand its lending program. The proposed project's\n            main benefit would be to strengthen CACB as an institution\n            and thereby establish a solid foundation for the ongoing\n            provision of agricultural credit to Yemeni farmers to enable\n            them in turn to finance the irrigation schemes, tractors,\n            improved seeds, fertilizers and other inputs which they need\n            to expand their production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen Arab Republic - Agricultural Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen Arab Republic -\n            Agricultural Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/11/725565/yemen-arab-republic-agricultural-credit-project","projn":"RY-Agr.Credit -- P005785","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Research,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901000585"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agricultural credit","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,agricultural\n            development,agricultural problems,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,Balance Sheets,bank lending,banking\n            services,cattle,Central Bank,Central Bank of Yemen,Central\n            Planning,Climatic conditions,commercial\n            banks,commodities,cotton,crops,cultivable land,dairy\n            products,debt,demand for food,deposits,development\n            agencies,development projects,diet,drainage,drinking\n            water,employment,equipment,expenditures,exports,Extension,extension\n            services,FAO,farmers,farming,feed,Financial\n            Institutions,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,Fisheries,Food\n            Crops,food grains,food production,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,fruits,GDP,goats,gross domestic\n            product,Housing,IFAD,imports,Income\n            Statements,incomes,inflation,insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,irrigation,labor costs,labor force,Land\n            Resources,lands,legumes,lending rates,Livestock,livestock\n            development,living standards,low income,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,agricultural\n            development,agricultural problems,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agricultural\n            Research,Agriculture,Balance Sheets,bank lending,banking\n            services,cattle,Central Bank,Central Bank of Yemen,Central\n            Planning,Climatic conditions,commercial\n            banks,commodities,cotton,crops,cultivable land,dairy\n            products,debt,demand for food,deposits,development\n            agencies,development projects,diet,drainage,drinking\n            water,employment,equipment,expenditures,exports,Extension,extension\n            services,FAO,farmers,farming,feed,Financial\n            Institutions,financial sector,FISCAL YEAR,Fisheries,Food\n            Crops,food grains,food production,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,fruits,GDP,goats,gross domestic\n            product,Housing,IFAD,imports,Income\n            Statements,incomes,inflation,insurance,interest\n            rate,interest rates,irrigation,labor costs,labor force,Land\n            Resources,lands,legumes,lending rates,Livestock,livestock\n            development,living standards,low income,"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"4102"},"facets":{}}}
