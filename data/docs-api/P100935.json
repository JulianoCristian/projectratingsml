Lessons\n            learned include: while it is always a good practice to keep\n            the project design simple and its scope commensurate with\n            implementation capacity, this is critical in post-conflict\n            countries where capacity is low not only within governments\n            but also outside of the government. There is competition\n            among projects/program for a limited number of qualified and\n            experienced staff. In Afghanistan, several donors execute\n            projects directly because of weak capacity of implementing\n            agencies, unlike the Bank which channels financing through\n            the government budget and systems. While the Bank's\n            approach is no doubt critical for long term capacity\n            building, the direct execution approach has a comparative\n            advantage in terms of timely execution. This option needs to\n            be considered in designing emergency projects, where: (i)\n            timely action is critical; and (ii) co-financing or parallel\n            financing by other donors to directly execute projects is a\n            possibility. The new Bank policy that allows potential\n            reallocation of cancelled International Development\n            Association (IDA) funds within the country provides an\n            incentive to both governments and Bank teams to identify\n            surplus funds that would remain unutilized and lapse at the\n            end of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Avian Influenza

Preparedness Emergency Project will help the Government\n            of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in developing\n            strategies to manage future outbreaks of infectious and\n            zoonotic diseases that may emerge and re-emerge. The\n            Environmental and Social Safeguards will be benefited from\n            this in two major ways: (1) Environmental safeguards will be\n            mainstreamed into protocols and procedures for the\n            inspection and disposal of animals during an outbreak in due\n            consideration of OIE standards, and (2) Policies on\n            compensation for poultry owners affected by future outbreaks\n            will be developed. There are no Social Safeguards triggered\n            by the project, which will have significant positive social\n            impact by protection of human lives through HPAI early\n            warning, prevention and containment, improved poultry\n            farming practices, increased public awareness of HPAI and\n            improved hygiene and food preparation practices and waste\n            management. Development of compensation policies to affected\n            poultry owners will contribute to mitigate the effects of\n            losses suffered from HPAI pandemic. Expected potential\n            adverse effects for each of the project activities are as\n            follows: Improper transport of any contaminated birds, bird\n            products or waste (eggs, manure and feathers) and equipment\n            (for example in open containers) may pose environmental and\n            public health risks; inadvertent release of chemicals in the\n            environment from unsatisfactory decontamination procedures\n            (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles,\n            etc.); and inadvertent human exposure and spread of the\n            virus due to: improper culling and disposal of dead birds\n            (wild birds, sick and dead birds from backyard and\n            commercial poultries); lack of, or improper  personal\n            protection equipment; improper disposal of farm waste (i.e.\n            bedding, manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an\n            outbreak); improper waste management from laboratories and\n            hospitals/clinics. These negative environmental impacts may\n            be mitigated through following appropriate biosafety level\n            standards; upgrading labs; training staff; following\n            internationally accepted lab waste management practices;\n            setting policy and operating procedures and the manual for\n            collecting infected and dead wild birds for sampling\n            purposes; public education and warning people; following\n            relevant guidelines on culling; on the worksite, using\n            hazmat zone concepts, buddy system, rest breaks and\n            decontaminating procedures as in OSHA and other occupational\n            health and safety standards; using pesticides to control\n            vectors during any storage or transport prior to disposal;\n            providing counselors for people, especially children,\n            affected by culling procedure; colleting and transporting in\n            closed, leak-proof containers;

- Avian and Human Influenza\n            Control and Preparedness Emergency Project : environmental assessment"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Avian and Human Influenza Control\n            and Preparedness Emergency Project will help the Government\n            of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in developing\n            strategies to manage future outbreaks of infectious and\n            zoonotic diseases that may emerge and re-emerge. The\n            Environmental and Social Safeguards will be benefited from\n            this in two major ways: (1) Environmental safeguards will be\n            mainstreamed into protocols and procedures for the\n            inspection and disposal of animals during an outbreak in due\n            consideration of OIE standards, and (2) Policies on\n            compensation for poultry owners affected by future outbreaks\n            will be developed. There are no Social Safeguards triggered\n            by the project, which will have significant positive social\n            impact by protection of human lives through HPAI early\n            warning, prevention and containment, improved poultry\n            farming practices, increased public awareness of HPAI and\n            improved hygiene and food preparation practices and waste\n            management. Development of compensation policies to affected\n            poultry owners will contribute to mitigate the effects of\n            losses suffered from HPAI pandemic. Expected potential\n            adverse effects for each of the project activities are as\n            follows: Improper transport of any contaminated birds, bird\n            products or waste (eggs, manure and feathers) and equipment\n            (for example in open containers) may pose environmental and\n            public health risks; inadvertent release of chemicals in the\n            environment from unsatisfactory decontamination procedures\n            (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles,\n            etc.); and inadvertent human exposure and spread of the\n            virus due to: improper culling and disposal of dead birds\n            (wild birds, sick and dead birds from backyard and\n            commercial poultries); lack of, or improper  personal\n            protection equipment; improper disposal of farm waste (i.e.\n            bedding, manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an\n            outbreak); improper waste management from laboratories and\n            hospitals/clinics. These negative environmental impacts may\n            be mitigated through following appropriate biosafety level\n            standards; upgrading labs; training staff; following\n            internationally accepted lab waste management practices;\n            setting policy and operating procedures and the manual for\n            collecting infected and dead wild birds for sampling\n            purposes; public education and warning people; following\n            relevant guidelines on culling; on the worksite, using\n            hazmat zone concepts, buddy system, rest breaks and\n            decontaminating procedures as in OSHA and other occupational\n            health and safety standards; using pesticides to control\n            vectors during any storage or transport prior to disposal;\n            providing counselors for people, especially children,\n            affected by culling procedure; colleting and transporting in\n            closed, leak-proof containers; only using trained and\n            vaccinated personnel; thoroughly disinfecting materials and\n            surfaces that come into contact with bird droppings, blood,\n            or other contaminated materials; and disinfecting workers\n            and others who come in contact with exclusion work zone."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Environment and social safeguards
