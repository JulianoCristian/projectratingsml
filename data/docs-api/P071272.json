Ratings for the\n            Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory.

Reaching the\n            poorest of the poor can prove difficult through group\n            formation owing to rigid rules of attendance, set savings\n            contributions, joint liability, and other group\n            non-negotiable. Going forward, the strategy may need to be\n            altered towards household or individual support, or\n            differentiated models that consider the needs of the poorest\n            of the poor, prior to group formation. This multi-stage\n            approach is bound to incur additional costs. This implies\n            trade-offs between depth and coverage and between short-term\n            and long-term impact that should be accommodated in project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

This is\n            the goal of the Employment Generation & Marketing\n            Mission (EGMM), which was established in 2005 by the Andhra\n            Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Program (APRPRP). Andhra\n            Pradesh's unemployment rate is slightly higher than\n            that of India, but these numbers do not give the full\n            picture of employment challenges. Rural areas are plagued\n            with low incomes and underemployment with many people\n            working in the informal sector, manual labor or seasonal\n            small scale farming. EGMM's mission is to respond to\n            this problem by facilitating employment in the formal sector\n            which offers more stable and higher incomes for economically\n            underprivileged rural youth so that poor households can\n            leave poverty within one generation. To achieve its goal of\n            generating employment for rural youth, EGMM works with the\n            state government, the private sector, and community\n            institutions of the rural poor. Accurate targeting is an\n            important component of the program. EGMM targets rural youth\n            from poor families of SHGs who are between 18 and 28 years\n            of age."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Creating jobs for rural youth in Andhra\n            Pradesh, India"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Creating jobs for rural youth in\n            Andhra Pradesh, India"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/01/17658927/creating-jobs-rural-youth-andhra-pradesh-india","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Absenteeism, attrition, boarding, cities,\n            classrooms, college education, community institutions,\n            community programs, Creating Jobs, curriculum, curriculum\n            development, districts, earning, employment, employment\n            generation, Employment Opportunities, employment training,\n            girls, hotel, housing, housing conditions, income, informal\n            sector, insurance, job creation, Job fairs, job market, Job\n            Placement, job seekers, job training, labor force, laborers,\n            Learning, literacy, manpower, manual labor, minimum wages,\n            non-farm employment, personality, poor communities, poor\n            families, poor households, poor rural women, Poverty\n            alleviation, Private Companies, private sector, remote\n            areas, RURAL, Rural areas, Rural Community, Rural\n            Development, rural families, rural family, rural\n            institutions, rural labor, RURAL LIVELIHOODS, rural poor,\n            Rural Poverty, Rural Poverty Reduction, rural training,\n            rural women, rural workforce, Rural Youth, sanitation,\n            savings, self-help, Service Sector, skills development,\n            targeting, teachers, training centers, Training cost,\n            training course, Training Program, training programs,\n            Trainings, unemployed, unemployed youth, unemployment,\n            unemployment rate, urban areas, village level, villages,\n            white collar workers, young people"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social protection and risk management,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","projn":"IN-Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction\n            Project -- P071272","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Youth and Governance,Housing & Human Habitats,Labor Markets,Primary Education","teratopic":"Education,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Social Protections and Labor","authors":{"authr":"Shah, Parmesh"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000445729_20130502141616"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Health,General education sector","theme":"Education for all,Participation and civic engagement,Poverty strategy, analysis and monitoring,Rural policies and institutions,Social risk mitigation","colti":"Livelihoods learning series ; series 2, note\n            no. 4","historic_topic":"Education,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Governance,Social Protections and Labor","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Rural Dev. & Livelihood Support (SASDL),Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF026723-PHRD-INDIA: ANDHRA PRADESH\n            RURAL POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT,TF057811-ANDHRA PRADESH RURAL POVERTY\n            REDUCTION PROJECT: PILOTING DROUGHT ADAPTA,TF058021-MAKING GLOBALIZATION WORK FOR\n            THE RURAL POOR IN INDIA,TF090131-MAKING GLOBALIZATION WORK FOR\n            THE RURAL POOR IN INDIA (BANK-EXE FOR INC,TF091148-INDIA: EMPOWERING DISABLED\n            PEOPLE IN INDIA,TF091828-CAPACITY BUILDING OF THE CCS\n            NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRICULTURAL MARKETI","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"repnb":"77215"},"facets":{}}}
