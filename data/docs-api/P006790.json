Some lessons learned included:  a\n            commitment to project implementation should be assured prior\n            to project execution, both on the part of the Government and\n            the Borrower; this commitment should translate into putting\n            in place a project execution unit endowed with sufficient\n            power to obtain executive decisions necessary for successful\n            implementation. At the project preparation stage a realistic\n            appraisal of the institutional framework of the Borrower and\n            the sector should be undertaken; in particular,\n            institution-building components should be included in a\n            project only if there is a sector-wide institutional\n            framework in place thereby ensuring that they have a\n            reasonable chance of being implemented.
