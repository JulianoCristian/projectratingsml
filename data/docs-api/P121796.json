Some lessons\n            learned included: in Latvia, the comprehensive spending\n            review undertaken jointly by the World Bank and\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) allowed the Government to\n            rapidly design a relevant program to respond to the crisis.\n            An important lesson from Latvia was that investing in\n            economic and social data analysis in good times and on a\n            regular basis is all the more relevant in a time of crisis,\n            especially given that the cost of such practice remains low.\n            The World Bank's support through the Special\n            Development Policy Loan (SDPL) series provided a framework\n            for the Government's policy reforms in the social\n            sectors during a time of deep fiscal cuts. The reform\n            experience in Latvia has shown that pension expenditures\n            exhibit very high inertia in times of recessions and even\n            extremely reform-minded governments are not able to quickly\n            reduce spending on such programs. Pension spending actually\n            increased by 27 percent in real terms over 2008-2010.\n            Although the Constitutional Court ruling about the pension\n            reform was very specific and related to the lack of\n            consultation on allowing cuts in pensions, the Government\n            did not pursue their reform. Budget rules should take into\n            account economic cycles. It is important to consider the\n            trajectory of social protection expenditures particularly\n            unemployment benefits and social safety net support programs\n            across the economic cycle in designing fiscal rules and\n            buffer-stock savings mechanisms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Safety Net and Social Sector Reform\n            Program

This operation is part of the special\n            lending support by the World Bank for the Republic of\n            Latvia. This is the second operation in a program of two\n            loans focused on safety net support and social sector\n            reform; the first Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL 1)\n            was fully disbursed on September 27, 2010. The second\n            Special Development Policy Loan (SDPL 2) supports actions\n            related to protecting the most vulnerable within a reform\n            program that underpins fiscal adjustment in the education\n            and health sector. The government has embarked on a\n            'funds follow the student' financing reform in the\n            education sector to increase efficiency and education\n            quality in light of the shrinking school-age population. The\n            government has made progress in implementing the SDPL\n            program. In substance, Latvia is on track to meet nine out\n            of the eleven triggers outlined in SDPL 1 for the second\n            operation.
