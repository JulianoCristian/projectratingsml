Some\n            lessons learned included: given the importance of land in\n            West Bank and Gaza (WBG), there must be sustained support\n            for the land sector at the highest levels of the Palestinian\n            Authority (PA). Despite the commitment of the PA to the\n            reforms in the land sector, and the commitment of the donors\n            to support this important priority, substantial project\n            resources were not spent.
