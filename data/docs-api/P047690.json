Lessons learned from the projects included:\n            There is a clear need for stronger monitoring and evaluation\n            of research projects. The lack of hard evidence about the\n            results of Competitive Grant Schemes (CGS) investments in\n            research and extension is a considerable shortcoming of all\n            but one project. In each of these countries, agricultural\n            productivity has risen since the mid 1990s, with growth\n            increasingly based on intensification rather than area\n            expansion. All institutions need a portion of the budget\n            that is core funded to cover costs of maintenance and\n            upgrading of physical and human resource infrastructure. CGS\n            usually only fund operating costs and the subprojects they\n            finance have only 2-3 years' duration. The CGS model is\n            more likely to strengthen the strongest agencies providing\n            research and extension services than it is to reduce the\n            disparities between the strong and the weak. The principle\n            of competition between alternative service providers breaks\n            down where the range of providers is limited and many of the\n            potential providers lack the skills needed to prepare viable\n            sub-project proposals."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Agricultural Technology and\n            Rural Education Project; Peru - Agricultural Research

- Agricultural Research and Extension Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is highly likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; and both Bank\n            and Borrower performances are satisfactory. Among the\n            lessons cited were the following: 1) The APL because of its\n            long-term nature is useful to carry out sustained policy\n            dialogue, since many of the institutional reforms proposed\n            in a project such as this require a strong political\n            commitment on the part of Government, and the reform of\n            public sector institutions are difficult to achieve from\n            within. 2) A competitive grant system is feasible within the\n            Peru and has been advantageous from several viewpoints: It\n            is a useful stimulus to the development of a decentralized,\n            private-sector led agricultural innovation system and\n            provides a means for leveraging additional resources. The\n            emphasis on a detailed business plan is valuable in ensuring\n            a market orientation to proposals. A two-phase selection\n            process with initial review of project profiles followed by\n            detailed preparation of proposals for those selected is\n            effective, particularly in light of considerable technical\n            assistance required for the preparation of detailed project\n            proposals. 3) Because of the weakness of many institutions\n            in the sector, considerable preparatory work -information,\n            training is required which has associated costs both in\n            financial terms and with respect to the time required to\n            successfully launch the decentralized, private sector-led\n            agricultural technology innovation system. This requires a\n            larger allocation of resources than was first envisaged. 4)\n            A Management Information System (MIS) should be established\n            in the very early stages of the project, and attention needs\n            to be given to making available the knowledge gained from\n            the subprojects particularly with respect to enabling its\n            use in further development of the agricultural technology\n            innovation system. 5) While independence from the mainstream\n            Ministry of Agriculture enables a PIU to effectively manage\n            project operations it is likely to limit its input to\n            national strategy formulation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru -
