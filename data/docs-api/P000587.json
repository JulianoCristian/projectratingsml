It would improve rural extension services, training\n            and supervision of staff, monitoring and planning, and\n            budgetary management and finance. It would strengthen animal\n            health, forestry and land conservation programs and would\n            complete two new CADERs and support existing CADER\n            operations.

The project\n            would address the problems of recurrent cost financing and\n            inadequate budgetary procedures, shortage of skilled\n            manpower and need for better donor coordination in the\n            sector. It would improve rural extension services, training\n            and supervision of staff, monitoring and planning, and\n            budgetary management and finance. It would strengthen animal\n            health, forestry and land conservation programs and would\n            complete two new CADERs and support existing CADER\n            operations. By strengthening the rural services network, the\n            project would provide for a more systematic approach to\n            extension, field trials and development of technical\n            packages, which should lead to increased foodcrop, livestock\n            and fuelwood production and better forestry management.\n            Increased food and meat production would result in import\n            savings. An additional benefit would be the improved\n            nutritional level of the rural population.
