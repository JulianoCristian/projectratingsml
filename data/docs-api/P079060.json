The overall outcome of these three projects\n            is rated satisfactory, and the performance of the Bank and\n            the Borrower is also rated as satisfactory. Lessons learned:\n            constant engagement with the client is important via a rich\n            technical dialogue and varied portfolio. The multi-sectoral\n            PLaRSSAL program team worked with the Government of Colombia\n            (GoC) in a wide range of lending and non-lending activities,\n            which facilitated the preparation of the program in two key\n            ways. First, the GoC and Bank teams developed a good working\n            relationship over many years. Second, the Bank team, through\n            this continued relationship was well versed in the\n            objectives, strategies, results-management, and outputs of\n            the social sectors, allowing for a greater focus on strategy\n            and implementation in the development of the program. A\n            commitment by the clients to implement a well-designed\n            Government program. The national development plan defined\n            each social institution's strategic objectives for the\n            Uribe administration, thereby providing a base upon which to\n            design the Bank's program. The social institutions were\n            committed to implementing the strategies and meeting the\n            quantifiable targets and saw the value added of Bank support\n            in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - First and Second series of\n            Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural Adjustment\n            Loans and a Third Labor Reform and Social Development Policy Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - First and Second\n            series of Programmatic Labor Reform and Social Structural\n            Adjustment Loans and a Third Labor Reform and Social\n            Development Policy Loan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/12/9375193/colombia-first-second-series-programmatic-labor-reform-social-structural-adjustment-loans-third-labor-reform-social-development-policy-loan","projn":"CO-3rd Prog.

follows: the outcome\n            was satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was substantial, and the\n            Bank and borrower performance were both satisfactory. The\n            experience of Programmatic Labor Reform and Social\n            Structural Adjustment Loan (PLaRSSAL I) implies the\n            following main lessons that have been considered in the\n            preparation of the PLaRSSAL II: Strong and sustained\n            dialogue between the Government of Colombia (GOC) and the\n            Bank through joint high-quality sector work on social\n            protection issues and operations is valuable for future\n            operations. Emphasis on outputs and outcomes, rather than\n            inputs and processes, facilitates monitoring and following\n            up of conditions by both the Government and the Bank. A\n            series of operations - SECAL, PLaRSSAL I, and PLaRSSAL II -\n            commits the Government to stay focused on monitoring\n            progress in outputs of key reform measures over a longer\n            time period in a coordinated, formal and systematic way.\n            While the institutional reform is underway, constant\n            collaboration between the GOC, the

C) Achievement of at\n            least 95 percent Expanded Program of Immunization (PAI)\n            coverage rate of 0-5 year old children by 2006. D) More\n            advances in the implementation of health system reform,\n            further expanding health insurance coverage of the poor,\n            reducing direct subsidy to public hospitals, and ensuring\n            quality of services of health insurers and care providers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - First Programmatic Labor Reform\n            and Social Structural
