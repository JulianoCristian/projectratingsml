Armenia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the government of Armenia used it\n            very effectively while trying to get the National Assembly\n            to adopt the law on 'conflict of interest'. These\n            outreach efforts were targeted at beneficiaries (poor and\n            middle class), parliamentary commissions and Civil Society\n            Organizations (CSOs) and finally led to the adoption of the\n            law. A well-designed development policy operation can be\n            effectively used to garner additional donor resources. Using\n            international rankings is inappropriate because rankings are\n            determined by relative performance and do not depend solely\n            on the individual government's efforts. In addition,\n            result indicators should be monitorable on an annual basis\n            and should not be based on periodic surveys. This was the\n            case for the cost of tax compliance survey which was\n            undertaken in 2009 and is now scheduled for 2014. Indicators\n            should also be clearly defined (what do we mean by\n            'poor') and realistic, maintaining an existing\n            Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) in the banking sector is\n            understandable at the time of crisis but targeting a CAR of\n            28 percent over the medium-term is not very realistic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - First, Second, and
