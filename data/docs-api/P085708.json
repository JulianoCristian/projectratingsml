Some lessons\n            learned includes: leveraging private sector investments for\n            rural electrification is possible if the legal and\n            regulatory framework includes certain incentives. Among the\n            factors that drove interest from international power\n            utilities are fiscal incentives and legal insurance included\n            in the 1998 electricity law (98-29) and the investment code.\n            Implementation of projects with innovative features takes\n            time which should be properly accounted for at the design\n            stage. A longer implementation timeframe should have been\n            provided to account for the high learning curve and\n            potential implementation challenges. Flexibility or\n            pragmatism is needed in certain contexts to achieve results.\n            Having a permanent dialogue/consultation platform is\n            critical in accelerating the implementation of projects with\n            multiple involved stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Electricity Services for Rural\n            Areas Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Electricity Services\n            for Rural Areas Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2013/06/18014385/senegal-electricity-services-rural-areas-project","projn":"SN-Gef Elec Srvc For Rural Areas (Fy05) -- P070530,SN-Elec.
