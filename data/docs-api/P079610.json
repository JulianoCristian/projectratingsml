Some lessons\n            learned included: livestock waste management technologies\n            should be simple to operate and compatible with the various\n            waste-handling practices and methods of livestock farms, be\n            cost-effective and offer financial returns and, be able to\n            be locally developed and serviced. A number of LWM\n            technologies exist, ranging from simple to complex, with\n            various cost implications that range from moderate to high.\n            As demonstrated by the project, selection of such technology\n            should be based on country specific conditions to ensure\n            acceptance, feasibility, efficiency and sustainability of\n            project investments. This project's comprehensive\n            approach integrated a suite of actions ranging from\n            demonstration of technical solutions, development of policy\n            development and improvement in enforcement, capacity\n            building and awareness-raising, to regional coordination and\n            dissemination. Successful demonstration of technical\n            solutions provided concrete waste management practices that\n            are financially viable, environmentally sound, socially\n            beneficial and locally accessible; showcasing what could be\n            studied and further replicated in the countries. Such\n            demonstration also formed the basis for development and\n            implementation of country specific policy actions such as\n            the replication strategies and improvement in environmental\n            enforcement. The needs and results of such demonstration\n            then helped refine capacity building activities to match the\n            actual needs, as did increased awareness among all\n            stakeholders, which improved acceptance of project\n            interventions and replication actions. Knowledge sharing\n            among the project countries and at the regional and global\n            levels was also a key."},"docna":{"cdata!":"East Asia and Pacific - Livestock Waste\n            Management in East Asia Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"East Asia and Pacific - Livestock\n            Waste Management in East Asia Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/06/16522827/east-asia-pacific-livestock-waste-management-east-asia-project","projn":"4E-Livestock Waste Management In East Asia\n            Project -- P079610","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Housing & Human Habitats,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"East Asia and Pacific","entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120720012522"},"theme":"Pollution management and environmental health,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,Central government administration,Animal production","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural extension, agricultural\n            production, AGRICULTURE, air quality, allergies, Animal,\n            animal feeds, animal health, Animal Husbandry, animal\n            manure, Animal production, Animal Waste, Avian Influenza,\n            biogas, budget allocations, Carbon, Carbon Dioxide, carbon\n            emissions, Cattle Manure, Clean Development Mechanism,\n            climate change, communities, cost effectiveness, cost\n            savings, crops, Dairy, Dairy Cattle, decision making,\n            disasters, Economic analysis, economic development,\n            effluents, Emission Reduction, emission reductions,\n            emissions, emissions reduction, ENVIRONMENTAL, environmental\n            degradation, environmental health, environmental impacts,\n            environmental issues, Environmental Management,\n            Environmental Protection, environmental quality,\n            environmental risk, expenditures, externalities, families,\n            farm, farm workers, farmers, farms, feed, fertilizers,\n            Financial Management, financial resources, fish, Gender,\n            health problems, households, hydrogen, incomes, Indigenous\n            Peoples, infectious diseases, Integration, intensive\n            livestock production, international organizations,\n            intervention, interventions, liquid wastes, LIVESTOCK,\n            Livestock Development, livestock farms, livestock\n            management, livestock operations, livestock populations,\n            livestock production, Livestock Research, Livestock Sector,\n            LIVESTOCK WASTE, LIVESTOCK WASTE MANAGEMENT, Livestock Waste\n            Management Technology, livestock waste pollution, livestock\n            wastes, living conditions, manure, manure management,\n            marketing, Natural Resources, new technologies, NGOs,\n            nongovernmental organizations, nutrient management, organic\n            matter, Pig, pig farm, pig production, policy instruments,\n            Pollution, Pollution Control, Pollution Reduction, posters,\n            poultry, poultry production, poverty reduction, Present\n            Value, private livestock producers, private sector,\n            producers, production costs, production patterns, public\n            goods, public health, Recycling, Resettlement, risk\n            management, Rural Development, safety, scientists, soil\n            conditioners, solid wastes, Spatial Planning, STRAW,\n            streams, Sustainable Development, technological options,\n            trainings, urban dwellers, urbanization, villages, WASTE\n            MANAGEMENT, water pollution, wood"}},"owner":"Social, Env. & Rural Sus.

The Governments\n            of China (Guangdong Province), Thailand and Vietnam have\n            applied for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant for\n            support to promote livestock waste management in respective\n            countries to address the regional pollution problems from\n            increased growth and intensification of livestock industry\n            in the project countries. This environmental assessment\n            identifies potential environmental risks and proposes\n            measures to mitigate them. Temporary negative impacts,\n            believed to be minor, include: vegetation damage during\n            lagoon, or constructed wetland development for the\n            establishment of treatment facilities; temporary land\n            occupation at the construction sites; potential soil erosion\n            and corresponding increase in sediment load during\n            construction; and noise, air, and water pollution. Other\n            impacts expected during operation include: impact on water\n            resources (surface and groundwater due to percolation from\n            the bottom of lagoons, breakage of lagoon embankments (above\n            ground lagoons), overflow due to incidence of high intensity\n            rainfall lagoon capacity; soil pollution through improper\n            application of solid and liquid manure; explosion of biogas\n            tanks; overproduction of solid and liquid manure and lack of\n            available land or farmer willingness to apply the manure on\n            agricultural land, forcing direct discharge of partially\n            treated manure to surface water bodies; cumulative impact\n            from large manure treatment system (eutrophication, increase\n            in COD, coli forms, etc.); and potential health effects from\n            pathogens and parasites through the application of solid and\n            liquid manure. Mitigation measures include: watershed\n            management; applying best management practices and improving\n            enforcement in livestock manure treatment systems; and\n            control of point and non-point source pollution of water resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethnic minority development plan for KOS farm"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"East Asia and Pacific -
