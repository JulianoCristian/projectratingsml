Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, while\n            borrower's was moderately unsatisfactory. The Project\n            included four key shortcomings: (i) unrealistic estimates;\n            (ii) lack of baseline and target data; (iii) a few\n            irrelevant indicators; and (iv) inadequate risk analysis\n            regarding availability of counterpart funds. The Original\n            Project achieved most of its objectives, but with delays.\n            The Additional Financing (AF) extended the Project scope by\n            including additional reservoirs and conveyance systems;\n            however, it faced serious difficulties in executing planned\n            activities within its three-year implementation period. The\n            Original Project suffered from two serious delays: first,\n            the difficulties in concluding works on one of the six\n            reservoirs, including the resettlement activities; second,\n            the late start of the construction of sections II and III of\n            the Integration Canal. Changes in state government in 2007\n            interrupted the flow of implementation, especially during\n            the last six months of tenure of the old Administration, and\n            again during the first six months of the new government. The\n            Additional Financing phase also suffered important delays\n            that led to the noncompletion of some Project activities\n            before the closing date. A strong political will is needed\n            to integrate institutions around water resources management.\n            Participatory, decentralized Water Resource Management (WRM)\n            at the river basin level is key for achievement of improved\n            management of resources. More attention needs to be given\n            early on to water quality issues. Intensive Bank involvement\n            in supervision of resettlement and environmental safeguards\n            is indispensable. Innovation processes like the ones\n            achieved in Ceara's water sector, require long term\n            vision and political commitment, financial stability and\n            institutional strength."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Ceara Integrated Water Resources\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Ceara Integrated Water\n            Resources

It will further promote soil and vegetation\n            management in tributary watersheds, to enhance water\n            conservation, in turn, minimizing erosion. Construction of\n            new water supply reservoirs and canals on relatively small\n            rivers in the semi-arid tropical environmental Ceara may\n            result in a variety of social impacts, including spread of\n            some vector-borne diseases and involuntary resettlement.\n            There may also be significant impacts associated with\n            induced regional development (such as expansion of irrigated\n            agriculture), which is likely to result from the\n            availability of new water supplies. The cost of drought\n            impacts are not only measured in financial costs, but have\n            also resulted in vast emigration of poor rural populations\n            from the rural areas into the metropolitan areas of the\n            country with resultant adverse impacts in the form of health\n            problems, family disruption, crime, and vulnerability of\n            these populations to drug abuse, prostitution and social\n            disarray. In addition, it has been demonstrated that, as a\n            result of each cyclical drought, a new generation of\n            educationally impaired young people have been created, due\n            to social disruption, inadequate nutrition and inadequate\n            educational opportunities. The cost of this impact alone,\n            while impossible to evaluate in financial terms, represents\n            a tremendously severe reduction of the country's\n            ability to achieve a sustainable economy and social system.\n            Because rural populations in water-short Ceara are\n            understandably concentrated near rivers and streams, it is\n            difficult to build storage reservoirs of significant size\n            without some resettlement. It is estimated that about 123\n            rural families would be resettled in all four Year 1\n            subprojects. The number of people to be resettled in\n            subsequent subprojects will not be known until the\n            subprojects are selected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Avaliacao e arcabouco para o reassentamento\n            : parte A"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Additional Financing for\n            Ceara Integrated Water Resource Management Project\n            (PROGERIRH) : resettlement instrument report (Vol. 6) :\n            Avaliacao e arcabouco para o reassentamento : parte A"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/09/9850439/brazil-additional-financing-ceara-integrated-water-resource-management-project-progerirh-resettlement-instrument-report-vol-6-avaliacao-e-arcabouco-para-o-reassentamento-parte","count":"Brazil","lang":"Portuguese","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Water utilization; Reservoirs; Water flow;\n            Coastal ecosystems; Salinity; Ecological balance; Ecosystem\n            management; Canals; Archaeological sites; Schistosomiasis\n            prevention; Indigenous populations; Agricultural wastes;\n            Liquid effluents & controls; Waste disposal; Noise\n            control; Solid waste management; Watershed management;\n            Reforestation; Environmental monitoring; Waterborne\n            diseases; Breeding; Natural habitats; Protected\n            areasaffluents,allocation of water,aquaculture,availability\n            of water,available water,bulk\n            water,canals,channels,conservation,construction,consumptive\n            uses,dams,decision making,decision making process,degraded\n            areas,discharge,domestic use,drainage,drinking\n            water,drinking water\n            supply,drought,dunes,ecosystem,environmental\n            conservation,Environmental Impacts,Environmental\n            Management,erosion,erosion control,estuaries,estuarine\n            ecosystems,exotic species,fish species,fishing,flood\n            plains,flooding,floods,fresh\n            water,gravel,humidity,Indigenous Peoples,industrial\n            water,intakes,irrigated\n            agriculture,irrigation,irrigators,karstic\n            areas,lagoons,limestone,Management of Water,marsh,municipal\n            level,Municipalities,nutrients,operational costs,operational\n            improvements,pipeline,pollution,programs,Protected\n            Areas,rainfall,rainfall distribution,Regional\n            Development,Reservoirs,riparian,river basin,river\n            basins,river beds,River Watershed,rivers,salt water,sea,sea\n            water,sedimentary basins,sediments,soils,springs,stored\n            water,streams,water availability,water bodies,water\n            consumption,Water Demand,Water Demand Management,water\n            distribution,water diversion,water intakes,water level,water\n            mains,Water Resources,Water Resources Management,Water\n            Sector,water storage,water supply,water supply\n            companies,water supply services,water supply\n            system,waters,Watershed,Watershed Management,watersheds"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Environment and natural resource management,Rural development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Brasil - Financiamento Adicional do PROGERIRH"}},"projn":"BR-Af To The Ceara Integrated Water Resource\n            Management Project -- P110487,BR-Ceara Integrated Water Resources\n            Management Project -- P006449","subtopic":"Water Resources Law,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry","docty":"Resettlement Plan","teratopic":"Water Resources,Law and Development,Water Supply and Sanitation","entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20080916025904"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration","theme":"Land administration and management,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Water resource management,Rural services and infrastructure","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Law and Development,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","owner":"Water - GP (GWADR)","trustfund":"TF029192-PHRD-NORTHEAST WATER RES.MGMT.
