Some lessons\n            learned included: memorandum of understandings (MOUs) should\n            be strengthened to ensure that co-financiers honor their\n            commitments for the life of projects and only cancel these\n            commitments in well define, documented, and transparent\n            circumstances and with agreement of all parties involved in\n            financing. To avoid delays and prevent one province being\n            held up by the inaction of another, as was the case with the\n            restructuring of this project, a central agency like\n            National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) should be\n            nominated as the responsible central agency to better\n            coordinate project provinces. Project design can be more\n            flexible in the future to allow staged restructuring where\n            one province is moving faster than another. The Bank should\n            look for more opportunities to develop similar partnerships\n            to enhance project outcomes. Standard physical and price\n            contingence items for Bank lending in China need continual\n            review and updating to better reflect reality. A stronger\n            and more permanent relationship between the water,\n            sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) committees and the town water\n            supply stations and county water resource bureaus (CWRBs)\n            needs to be developed to support fledging community\n            committees that have been assigned the management,\n            operations, and maintenance (MOM) responsibilities of water\n            supply schemes, but have little or no experience with the\n            operational and technical aspects of assets assigned. A\n            programmatic approach to project design can be effective in\n            addressing major national policy issues and challenges,\n            particularly combined with a good technical assistance in China."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Western Provinces Rural Water\n            Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene Promotion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Western

Western Provinces Rural Water\n            Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objective of the Western\n            Provinces Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene\n            Promotion Project is to for China increase access of poor\n            participating communities to sustainable and equitable water\n            supply, sanitation and hygiene promotion services by\n            adopting an integrated and participatory approach. The\n            closing date of the project will be extended from September\n            30, 2012 to March 29, 2013. The extension is necessary to\n            allow time for implementation of the remaining works to\n            maximize the project's ability to increase access to\n            safe water supply and safe sanitation. The project was\n            funded by a combined investment of US$75 million: US$25\n            million from a World Bank loan, US$25 million equivalent\n            from a Department for International Development (DfID)\n            grant, and a US$25 million equivalent investment by the\n            Government of China (GOC). The loan and DfID grant were\n            supported by three legal documents, dated September 29,\n            2007, namely: 1) a loan agreement between the Bank and the\n            people's Republic of China; 2) a project agreement\n            between the Bank and both borrowers-Shaanxi province and\n            Sichuan province; and 3) a grant agreement between the\n            people's Republic of China and the Bank acting as\n            administrator of the DfID grant."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Western Provinces Rural\n

China's urban population resides\n            primarily in city districts (shiqu) and town districts\n            (zhenqu), which constitute the urban core of larger\n            administrative units called cities (shi) and respectively\n            towns (zhen). Cities and towns in China are expansive\n            regions, with administrative territories much larger than in\n            the rest of the world (Chan 2007). Cities are conceptually\n            equivalent to counties in the U.S. and thus the whole of\n            China's territory is basically covered by 287\n            prefecture and provincial level municipalities, which within\n            their area include 654 city districts - the cities proper in\n            the conventional sense of this word - and 19,322 towns. Each\n            town in turn includes a town district - an urban core that\n            occupies a fraction of the town's area but accounts for\n            most of the town's urban population. While cities and\n            towns as a whole overlap in their administrative boundaries,\n            with multiple towns nested within each city, city districts\n            and town districts are disjoint structures, being urban\n            embryos within the administrative boundaries of\n            territorially larger cities and towns.

China's urban population resides\n            primarily in city districts (shiqu) and town districts\n            (zhenqu), which constitute the urban core of larger\n            administrative units called cities (shi) and respectively\n            towns (zhen). Cities and towns in China are expansive\n            regions, with administrative territories much larger than in\n            the rest of the world (Chan 2007). Cities are conceptually\n            equivalent to counties in the U.S. and thus the whole of\n            China's territory is basically covered by 287\n            prefecture and provincial level municipalities, which within\n            their area include 654 city districts - the cities proper in\n            the conventional sense of this word - and 19,322 towns.
