Some lessons learned\n            included: the Bank-supported program design needs to reflect\n            the reality that comprehensive civil service reforms and\n            public expenditure management cannot be accomplished on the\n            same time schedule; civil service reforms take significantly\n            longer to achieve, depending not only on major shifts in\n            long-held attitudes toward hiring, but also the\n            Government's very ability to pay a decent salary to\n            civil servants. To put public expenditure and civil service\n            reform on the same time schedule and expecting full\n            implementation is not realistic. To achieve better results\n            and within the short timeframe of a policy operation, civil\n            service reform could be scaled down to either of a couple of\n            options: reforms that affect only a certain top layer of\n            management, as was implemented in Albania; or a pilot reform\n            that focuses on selected ministries, possibly the ministry\n            of finance, rather than all ministries at once. If senior\n            management is appropriately recruited, it can lead to\n            improved recruitment at lower levels. The ministries can\n            then ensure a higher quality, less pro forma, due process\n            recruitment. The Bank did not tailor the design of GSAC to\n            the risks of disruption of elections scheduled before the\n            end of the program. More caution is needed even if the\n            consensus is that there will be no change of government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Governance Structural\n            Adjustment Credit

Credit\n            (GSAC) to the Kyrgyz Republic. The GSAC supports the\n            Government's program to strengthen the effectiveness of\n            the state and improve governance. It's main objectives\n            are: to improve the transparency and responsiveness of the\n            public sector and enhance the ability of external\n            stakeholders to hold it accountable and at the same time\n            increase efficiency, effectiveness of the public sector. To\n            achieve these objectives, the GSAC is supporting reforms\n            aimed at (i) improving personal accountability of political\n            officials and civil servants and enhancing the effectiveness\n            of the civil service; (ii) improving service delivery in the\n            health and education sectors; (iii) streamlining the\n            structure of Government ministries and agencies; (iv)\n            strengthening voice and participation by improving public\n            access to official information; (iv) improving the\n            interaction between regulatory agencies and business\n            enterprises; (v) strengthening public expenditure\n            management; and (vi) improving transparency, value for money\n            and accountability in public procurement. The first tranche\n            was disbursed on effectiveness of the credit on 30 July\n            2003. The second tranche was originally planned for\n            disbursement in mid 2004. However, there were delays in\n            meeting some of the critical conditions, which were\n            increased by unstable political conditions in the Kyrgyz\n            Republic following the fall of the previous government in\n            March 2005. The tranche was eventually disbursed in May\n            2007. By this time most of the conditions for the third\n            tranche had already been met. All conditions have now been\n            met. The closing date of the credit is June 30, 2008."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Governance Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz

It has two complementary objectives: (a) to\n            improve the transparency and responsiveness of the public\n            sector and enhance the ability of external stakeholders to\n            hold it accountable; and (b) to increase efficiency,\n            effectiveness, and accountability within the public sector.\n            With regard to the first objective, the GSAC supports\n            reforms aimed at 1) improving personal accountability of\n            political officials and civil servants; 2) strengthening\n            voice and participation by improving public access to\n            official information; 3) improving the interaction between\n            regulatory agencies and business enterprises; and 4)\n            strengthening external audit. To advance the second\n            objective, the operation supports reforms directed at 1)\n            strengthening public expenditure management, by establishing\n            a more strategic and transparent budget formulation process,\n            and strengthening accountability and transparency in budget\n            execution; 2) improving the internal control environment; 3)\n            improving transparency, value for money and accountability\n            in public procurement; 4) improving service delivery in the\n            health and educations sectors; 5) enhancing the\n
