environmental objective (GEO)\n            outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, risk to GEO outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: multi-sector energy project without a\n            strong, cross-sector institutional focus can result in a\n            loss of commitment and underachievement of objectives.\n            Notwithstanding the need to address urgent issues in\n            multiple energy subsectors, if project scope and design are\n            not tailored to the institutional capacity of the\n            implementing agencies, there is a substantial risk of delays\n            and limited achievement of project objectives. The lack of\n            performance indicators for capacity building and the absence\n            of a clear linkage to planning for staff-development limit\n            the extent of impact assessment for training and technical\n            assistance programs. If the detailed design of a major\n            project is not completed prior to credit approval for an\n            investment operation, there is a high risk of delay and or\n            cancellation. The lack of a clear results chain in a\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) framework can lead to\n            major data gaps and missed opportunities for impact\n            evaluation. The lack of a system of standardized testing for\n            improved fuel wood stoves prevents a full assessment of the\n            program's impact on reducing emissions from the burning\n            of wood. The lack of detailed coordination of rehabilitation\n            work for urban power distribution systems with city planning\n            authorities and shortages of local construction materials\n            can be major obstacles to timely completion of the work."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Energy Access Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Energy Access

of\n            renewable energy technologies; and (iv) provide technical\n            support to the Borrower for the institutional and capacity\n            building of key sector agencies, and for regulatory, fiscal\n            and institutional reforms in the mining sector to attract\n            private investment. The original credit components remain\n            unchanged.

The additional\n            financing credit will help finance the costs associated with\n            scaling-up certain components of the project: (a) The urban\n            distribution and load dispatch component will receive US$l37\n            million to upgrade the distribution network and associated\n            substations in seven additional cities along with Addis\n            Ababa. This will increase the reliability, efficiency and\n            capacity of those urban networks, allowing new consumers to\n            be connected in these cities; (b) the grid based rural\n            electrification component will receive US$30 million to\n            increase the population's access to electricity in\n            rural areas. This component will electrify about 50 new\n            villages and connect more than 70,000 consumers in those\n            villages; (c) the Renewable Energy component will receive\n            US$10 million to evaluate and appraise the geothermal\n            resource base of Ethiopia and to assess whether its energy\n            production capacity can be diversified using this renewable\n            energy resource base; and (d) the institutional capacity\n            building component will receive US$3 million to update the\n            power sector master plan of Ethiopian Electric Power\n            Corporation (EEPCo), finance training cost of EEPCo, and\n            strengthen the planning and procurement capacity of EEPCo.\n            Under this project a total of about 700,000 consumers are\n            expected to be connected through intensification of\n            connections in urban and rural areas.
