The lessons learned indicate that realistic\n            evaluation of the institutional capacity for managing\n            reforms and project activities and an appropriate project\n            scope of the project, enhances the chances of success. A\n            project can be designed such that it meets immediate needs,\n            achieves institutional and sustainable development and\n            facilitates other substantive reforms. Project effectiveness\n            is considerably enhanced when project concept and objectives\n            are based on stakeholder consensus and Borrower priorities.\n            In supporting systemic reform, project impact and\n            sustainability can be enhanced by exploiting synergies\n            between investment and adjustment operations. A particular\n            strength of the project design was that the Structural\n            Adjustment Program which was being supported concurrent to\n            the implementation of the Project, required the necessary\n            legal and regulatory changes as well as the crucial\n            budgetary increases needed to support the project reforms.\n            Monitoring and evaluation systems cannot always establish\n            national-level targets at the time of project design; more\n            attention needs to be applied in having a dynamic system,\n            updated regularly with agreed intermediate and process\n            benchmarks. Obstacles to the rationalization of schools and\n            staffing should not be underestimated. The project succeeded\n            in removing disincentives to rationalization at the\n            school-level, but had a smaller than expected impact on\n            class size and staffing ratios. School-based management and\n            per-pupil funding reforms need to carefully ensure that the\n            reporting and accountability framework of schools to the\n            Government is not weakened. Even with a relatively simple\n            project design, significant supervision resources are needed\n            to ensure continuous and consistent implementation of the\n            reform. Continuity and commitment of senior level Ministry\n            and PMU staff during the project life are key to maximum\n            project success. During the four years of project life\n            substantial continuity and support were provided by the\n            Project Management Unit team and the senior level Ministry staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Education Financing and Management\n            Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Education Financing and\n            Management

The first component\n            improves textbook production and distribution by financing\n            the following: (1) purchasing and distributing core\n            textbooks for general education grades 1-10 to schools over\n            a four-year period; (2) providing equipment and technical\n            assistance to establish a computerized system for\n            consolidating textbook orders; (3) providing technical\n            assistance and training in curriculum design and preparation\n            of publishers guidelines; (4) providing technical assistance\n            and training for bid administrators, bid evaluators,\n            authors, and publishers in book procurement; and (5)\n            providing training and information for school directors,\n            teachers, and parents in managing school-based revolving\n            funds and in allocating subsidies to poor students. The\n            second component supports detailed design, piloting, and\n            implementation of the government's strategy for\n            reforming the general education system. Its sub-components\n            will increase efficiency by rationalizing schools and\n            staffing; and improve resource mobilization and school\n            performance by granting schools
