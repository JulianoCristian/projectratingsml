There were nine lessons learned: 1)\n            Project provided development partners with a viable platform\n            to provide consistent and concordant policy advice to the\n            Government of Punjab under a common results framework,\n            jointly designed with the Government of Punjab. 2) The use\n            of disbursement linked indicators with predefined\n            implementation progress and performance targets, has helped\n            the sector dialogue to focus on the most critical factors\n            necessary for the achievement of project development\n            outcomes. 3) Strong political commitment and ownership are\n            critical for successfully steering a sector-wide reform\n            program. 4) Continuous and intensive Bank engagement across\n            the reform program and technical and advisory support\n            resulted in timely identification and resolution of\n            challenges during implementation. 5) The public private\n            partnership initiative in Punjab has generated large and\n            quick gains in both enrollment and achievement. 6) A\n            realistic assessment of the district and provincial\n            capability to implement reforms is important to inform the\n            design and sequencing of the reform program for maximum\n            possible impact. 7) Clear articulation of linkages in\n            formulating indicators, disbursement linked indicators\n            targets and protocols is important when focusing efforts on\n            factors that are critical to the achievement of the project\n            objectives. 8) Stronger analytical work is desired to select\n            the set of project development objectives indicators. 9)\n            Staff turnover can adversely affect project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Punjab Education Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Punjab Education\n
