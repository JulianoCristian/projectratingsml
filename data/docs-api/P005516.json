The operation was successful\n            in large part because the proposed reform agenda came at the\n            right time. Significant changes can be made with limited\n            resources. Maintenance is too often delayed because of lack\n            of funding.

The AMRL\n            will help Morocco promote a reform targeted towards: a) a\n            National Asset Management Policy; and, b) building\n            Management Systems for the public Health, Education and\n            Higher Education sectors. While the cost of maintenance and\n            asset management can be high in the short term, its return\n            in the longer term is high. Thus, the project will finance\n            the short-term reform costs, and help fill the budgetary gap\n            during the period of adjustment. Improving public asset\n            management will generate efficiency gains, and\n            medium-long-term savings, and improve the maintenance of\n            properties.
