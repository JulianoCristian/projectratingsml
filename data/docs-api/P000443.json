The proposed project consists of the\n            reconstruction of the Bangui-Bossembele road to two-lane\n            bituminous sealed standard including the construction of a\n            two-lane bridge over the M'Bali River. The benefits for\n            C.A.E. will mainly consist of savings in vehicle operating\n            costs, maintenance costs and distance savings. The project\n            will also stimulate agricultural development in some\n            populated areas by providing improved access to markets and\n            reduced costs of supplying inputs. On the external side, the\n            project is not only an important route for import/export\n            traffic via Cameroon, but also a part of the Trans-African\n            highway and of the Trans-Equatorial route serving\n            land-locked Chad.

the Ocean through the reconstruction\n            of the Bangui-Bossembele section (145 km) of the road to\n            Cameroon. The proposed project consists of the\n            reconstruction of the Bangui-Bossembele road to two-lane\n            bituminous sealed standard including the construction of a\n            two-lane bridge over the M'Bali River. The benefits for\n            C.A.E. will mainly consist of savings in vehicle operating\n            costs, maintenance costs and distance savings. The project\n            will also stimulate agricultural development in some\n            populated areas by providing improved access to markets and\n            reduced costs of supplying inputs. On the external side, the\n            project is not only an important route for import/export\n            traffic via Cameroon, but also a part of the Trans-African\n            highway and of the Trans-Equatorial route serving\n            land-locked Chad. The project therefore contributes also to\n            the economic development of the Central African Region."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Empire - Third Highway
