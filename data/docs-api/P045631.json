Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory. These\n            are the lessons learned: Strong and continued\n            Borrower's commitment to the project objectives during\n            preparation and implementation are critical to successful\n            implementation of technical assistance projects. The\n            Borrower's commitment should also be obtained for using\n            the credit funds for financing TA if the Credit is made\n            available. It is valuable to coordinate the Bank-supported\n            reform agenda with the content and timing of donor\n            assistance. Ideally, donor coordination should be maintained\n            throughout project implementation. The project\n            implementation unit (PIU) plays a key role in the success of\n            the project. the PIU's financial management and\n            procurement and reporting capacity should be reviewed and\n            strengthened during project preparation so that the PIU can\n            begin implementation immediately after effectiveness. If an\n            implementation support TA project continues after completion\n            of the related adjustment operations, the Bank and the\n            Borrower should continue the dialogue on the sector\n            developments and monitor that the former funds will be used\n            efficiently to continue the support, to sustain the outcomes\n            of the reform aagenda, and to respond to new development\n            needs. TA loans should be flexible (funding could be\n            indicated in the legal agreement not by components, but by\n            disbursement categories)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic -
