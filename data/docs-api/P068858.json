Some lessons learned included: participatory\n            approaches to wetland restoration design were critical for\n            project success, which hinged on changing people's\n            perceptions of wetlands, and gaining the full support for\n            restoration among authorities and stakeholders. Protected\n            area (PA) local consultative councils and public awareness\n            campaigns effectively supported stakeholder involvement. The\n            established panel of experts was instrumental in providing\n            independent assessments that balanced the best interests of\n            local stakeholders and Government. Skepticism about wetland\n            restoration among stakeholders transformed into strong\n            support through their early involvement in planning and\n            decision making processes. Linking small grants and farmer\n            transition support programs to the broader objective of\n            wetlands restoration was highly beneficial to local\n            communities to ensure: (i) commitment to common goals;\n            engagement with the main restoration activity; and (ii)\n            raising public awareness of environmental and conservation\n            issues. If well targeted and managed, the community-level\n            grant programs financing local initiatives on the ground can\n            be effective to engage diverse local stakeholders\n            (communities, farmers, etc.) with the main project activity\n            and to foster stronger public commitment to the project\n            objectives. The project region had lost over 80 percent of\n            its floodplains and wetlands and restoring these is a\n            significant environmental achievement. This project focused\n            on wetlands potential to reduce nutrient loads; however, the\n            wider environmental benefits, especially for conservation of\n            biodiversity and reproduction of bio-resources such as fish\n            and birds, have produced additional benefits."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Wetlands Restoration and\n            Pollution Reduction

        Bulgaria is that local communities and local authorities in\n            the Persian Nature Park and Kalimok/Brushlen Protected Site\n            areas adopt sustainable natural respurces management\n            practices. There are two amin project components. First, in\n            the initial phase of this component, marshland will be\n            recovered and restored in two already identified sites to\n            demonstrate the use of wetlands as nutrient sinks.\n            Additional sites are expected to be identified and restored\n            later during project implementation. The GEF funds will\n            finance consultancy services for the elaboration of detailed\n            engineering designs, baseline surveys, and the supervision\n            of construction and rehabilitation activities of small\n            infrastructure which will regulate water flows. Grantsupport\n            is being sought for consultant services pre-feasibility and\n            feasibility studies, design of restoration activities, and\n            needed civil works. The second component supports the next\n            step towards sustainable resource managmeent and protection\n            within the two protected sites by funding the preparation of\n            protected areas management plans at the two sites. It moves\n            on to then support the implementation of priority actions\n            identified in these plans; strengthens monitoring programs\n            for water quality, biodiversity, socioeconomic indicators,\n            and health risks; builds a public awareness and education\n            campaign; and strengthens land/water management

Project will assist in the restoration\n            of wetlands in the Danube River basin and pilot the use of\n            riparian wetlands as nutrient traps. Since this is the first\n            project of its kind, it should be well-designed,\n            environmentally sound, and socially acceptable so that it\n            can be a model for similar development in the future. This\n            environmental assessment concludes that firstly, the\n            wetlands restoration may not lead to the expected increase\n            in fish resources. A technical solution is proposed to\n            ensure an annual flooding for around 60 days which would be\n            sufficient for successful spawning of fish and for inflowing\n            of significant volumes of water from the Danube to be\n            treated by the water vegetation. Secondly, risk of negative\n            impacts by flooding and groundwater on arable and non-arable\n            land, buildings, and drainage structures is considered very\n            high. A compensation system should be agreed upon with the\n            affected land owners. The technical project should stress on\n            the inland protection. It should also focus on continued\n            functioning of the remaining part of the drainage system to\n            prevent flooding and damaging of the drainage system.\n            Thirdly, increased population of mosquitoes, risk of\n            malaria, and population of fish products are not expected.\n            However, it is advisable to have a mosquito management plan\n            using both biological and chemical control measures, and\n            introduce the European standards for control of fish products."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -
