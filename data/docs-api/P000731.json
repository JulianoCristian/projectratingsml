The main objectives of the\n            project were to increase food production in areas that are\n            vulnerable to drought by emphasizing irrigation development.\n            The project comprised several components: (i) institutional\n            capacity building through technical assistance (TA) and\n            staff training; (ii) irrigation development; (iii) provision\n            of agriculture support services including extension and (iv)\n            soil conservation through biological bund Stabilization. The\n            project implementation started to pick-up in 1993, boosted\n            by improvement in the economic climate which had emerged\n            after the change in the new Government's macro-economic\n            policies coupled with regionalization, and the accelerated\n            progress continued until the project closed at the end of\n            1996. The overall project outcome was considered\n            satisfactory. One important lesson learned in this project\n            is that for sustained growth in rural agriculture,\n            improvement in rural and feeder roads has a direct impact,\n            and this should be addressed with greater emphasis in future\n            projects. Under the various support provided by the project,\n            considerable achievement was made to improve nutritional\n            condition and income of the Ethiopian people."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Small-Scale Irrigation and Soil\n            Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia - Small-Scale Irrigation\n            and Soil
