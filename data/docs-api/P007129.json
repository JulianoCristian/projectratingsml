Sustainability is rated unlikely on\n            balance, though marginally so. Bank and borrower performance\n            are both rated satisfactory, but quality at entry is rated\n            unsatisfactory. The main lessons learned from this project\n            are: Technical assistance that aims to encourage private\n            investment in extractive industries requires the preparation\n            of comprehensive EAs with a countrywide focus, with special\n            attention given to reviewing the adequacy and sustainability\n            of regulations and institutional mechanisms for protecting\n            sensitive ecosystems and communities. The EA should be\n            prepared as early as possible after project identification,\n            its recommendations should be reflected in project design,\n            and extensive consultations with all potential stakeholders\n            are critical. Finally, appropriate mitigation rules and\n            enforcement institutions should be developed as early as\n            possible. When most environmental responsibilities are\n            delegated to a sector ministry, as in Ecuador, it is\n            important to reduce potential internal conflicts of interest\n            between the sector ministry's roles as investment\n            promoter and environmental control and enforcement agency,\n            by clearly separating the responsibility for these\n            functions. Furthermore, sector oversight capacity also needs\n            to be built up within the Ministry of the Environment, and\n            support of local communities needs to be secured. Projects\n            and programs involving natural resources extraction need to\n            be carefully and proactively managed. The participation of\n            NGOs and potentially affected local community associations\n            in the monitoring of impacts was effective in Ecuador. For\n            technical assistance projects addressing complex\n            environmental, social and regulatory issues, continued Bank\n            involvement beyond project closure would enhance the\n            likelihood of sustainability. In Ecuador, the abrupt cut-off\n            of the Bank's and co financiers' support resulted\n            in program discontinuity and lack of replication of project\n            achievements, in particular in the ASM program. Programs\n            aiming at reducing or eliminating negative impacts from\n            artisan and informal small-scale mining require continuity\n            over-time, flexible timing, and a comprehensive approach\n            oriented toward addressing social, financial, and managerial\n            aspects as well as legal and technical aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Mining

The key lessons drawn include: Sector\n            development should be part of an overall political and\n            economic reform. This project provides a good example of the\n            importance to approach sector reform in an integrated way.\n            It is critical to design and implement during project\n            preparation and implementation a more systematic social\n            strategy, including improved information and consultation\n            participatory process. The geo-scientific information\n            management represents a very valuable tool not only for\n            sector development but also for land use and related\n            potential conflicts management.
