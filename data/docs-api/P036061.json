The lessons learned indicate that efforts\n            deployed at appraisal to set up a policy dialogue with the\n            Borrower yield high outcomes. It also impacts the\n            implementation of the Project in a very positive manner. The\n            preparation phase allowed for the establishment of a new\n            port law in Poland. Two best practices regarding environment\n            were implemented under the project and sample mitigation\n            measures are available for consideration by other Bank teams\n            or other Borrowers: (i) Wolin National Park road\n            rehabilitation included state of the art mitigation elements\n            that could inspire decision makers elsewhere (e.g. the road\n            passes through the Biebrza National Park in Eastern Poland);\n            and (ii) the construction of Wisla Smiala outlet protection\n            can also be regarded as a best practice for future\n            breakwater constructions in a fragile biotope. Polish roads\n            and bridges are often over-designed, and MOI should oversee\n            the designers more. Savings could be obtained if the\n            standards for roads and bridges were optimized and economic\n            evaluations were introduced as key elements of the process.\n            When a Technical Assistance (TA) component is part of the\n            initial design of a project, it should never be dropped\n            unless robust justification is provided. In the case of the\n            present project, technical assistance was foreseen to\n            accompany the port reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Port Access and Management
