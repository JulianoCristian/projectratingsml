The lessons learned indicate that following up\n            sector work, targets and implementation plans are better\n            conceived. However, when components involve coordination\n            between multiple agencies, new technologies or changing\n            roles of public institutions increase the difficulty of well\n            thought-out plans. Demarcation of forest boundaries suffered\n            considerable delays and its achievement was much lower than\n            the planned targets due to lack of working arrangements,\n            policy direction, and coordination between Department of\n            Lands, Land Development Department, and Royal Forestry\n            Department. Introduction of new technologies should be\n            phased and tested at a smaller-scale before expansion.\n            Property valuation development programs should clearly\n            identify the respective roles of the public and private\n            sector in valuation, and the most appropriate\n            institution/agency for support to valuation development. A\n            strong commitment of the borrower/implementing agencies is a\n            prerequisite for successful implementation. Bold\n            initiatives, such as this 20-year program to provide land\n            titles, create spill-over effects and valuable public-sector competency."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Land Titling Third Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Land Titling Third Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/03/2246833/thailand-land-titling-third-project","projn":"TH-- Land Titling III -- P004803","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Municipal Housing and Land,Land and Real Estate Development,Urban Housing,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03042304044692"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actual cost,allocative efficiency,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,Civil Service,construction,cost\n            of capital,cost\n            savings,decentralization,deconcentration,environmental\n            impact assessment,Exchange Rate,expenditures,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Forestry,households,improved land,income,income\n            distribution,Institutional Development,land\n            administration,Land Development,land management,land\n            market,land tenure,land title,Land Titling,land\n            transactions,land\n            value,landowners,legislation,mortgages,Natural\n            Resources,office buildings,operating costs,poverty\n            line,present value,productivity,property valuation,property\n            values,Rural Development,savings,tax\n            collection,taxation,technical assistance,technological change"},"1":{"cdata!":"actual cost,allocative efficiency,Bank\n            Performance,Bank supervision,Civil Service,construction,cost\n            of capital,cost\n            savings,decentralization,deconcentration,environmental\n            impact assessment,Exchange Rate,expenditures,FISCAL\n            YEAR,Forestry,households,improved land,income,income\n            distribution,Institutional Development,land\n            administration,Land Development,land management,land\n            market,land tenure,land title,Land Titling,land\n            transactions,land\n            value,landowners,legislation,mortgages,Natural\n            Resources,office buildings,operating costs,poverty\n            line,present value,productivity,property valuation,property\n            values,Rural Development,savings,tax\n            collection,taxation,technical assistance,technological change"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"25637"},"698060":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/08/698060/thailand-third-land-titling-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1994/08/698060/thailand-third-land-titling-project","new_url":"1994/08/698060/thailand-third-land-titling-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/08/30/000009265_3961006014748/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1994/08/30/000009265_3961006014748/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","loan_no":"3797","datestored":"2001-04-17T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1994-08-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Third Land Titling Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Third Land Titling Project will\n            support the third phase of the Government's national\n            land titling program, aimed at providing secure documented\n            land tenure to eligible land owners, developing the long\n            term sustainability of the Department of Lands'\n            institutional capacity, improving land administration\n            service delivery, and developing an effective national\n            valuation function.
