The Taiz\n            Water Supply Pilot Project had an unsatisfactory outcome, is\n            unlikely to be sustainable, has a modest institutional\n            development impact, and unsatisfactory performances by both\n            the Borrower and the Bank.

Lessons reinforce that: 1) the\n            timing in water resources management should not be too\n            ambitious, specifying that the leverage achievable under a\n            single operation, of limited size, should not be\n            overestimated, if driving for reforms in a crucial subject\n            such as water policy; 2) project design, and implementation\n            arrangements should be kept simple, exemplified by the\n            coordination among a number of departments, and\n            institutions, including regional agricultural offices.\n            Despite initial coordination difficulties at the central\n            level, the decentralized implementation mechanisms of the\n            project, assumed by the various Project Implementation\n            Units, and coordination at the local level, proved to be\n            successful; 3) more efforts are needed to ensure adequate\n            funding of recurrent costs; thus, the Bank should raise this\n            issue in its dialogue with the Ministry of Finance, and the\n            Ministry of Planning, in a concerted manner, and beyond the\n            level of individual projects; 4) cost sharing targets, and\n            upper limits on the size of farms, need to be realistic.\n            Initially, the project envisaged full cost recovery for\n            irrigation equipment, and prescribed a maximum size of\n            benefiting farms; however, no farm met these conditions. To\n            this end, the farm size was modified, and farmers'\n            contributions to cost-sharing reduced, a pragmatism that\n            allowed implementation, without abandoning the principles of\n            cost sharing; and, 5) basin planning should be piloted,\n            given the limited capacity of implementing agencies;\n            actually, pilot basin planning should be introduced in an\n            area under favorable conditions, and demonstrated ability of\n            local users, to then engage in collective efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Land and
