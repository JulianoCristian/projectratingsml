The lessons learned indicate that a\n            realistic assessment of the implementation capacity of the\n            Borrower to implement project activities and to use\n            Bank's procurement and financial reporting guidelines\n            would allow for a proper design of initial phases of project\n            implementation and realistic schedule. There was no\n            experience or practice in the Ministry of Education and\n            Science (MES) to share information or organize coordination\n            meetings. Every change in the composition of the members of\n            the teams involved in Project implementation causes\n            irrecoverable delays in project implementation. For many\n            civil servants assigned to implementation teams, work on\n            project execution is an additional external responsibility\n            not associated with their everyday tasks. Information\n            gathering, analysis and dissemination is essential not only\n            for the successful implementation of the project, but also\n            for the sustainability of an overall reform. It is\n            especially vital to get the participation of stakeholders in\n            introducing reform and modernization programs in countries\n            like Bulgaria, and in sectors such as education. Social and\n            organizational assessments are especially helpful in\n            understanding the issues, as there is a clear link between\n            the reluctance to reform the education system and the\n            reluctance to change governance structures of the education\n            system. In order for policy makers to track the success of a\n            reform project they need to be able to monitor the results\n            and the impact of the intervention. Programs designed to\n            support policy reforms are jeopardized by government change.\n            In retrospect, while the preparation team gave the\n            project's design a moderate rating for political risks,\n            it did not set out a clear strategy for mitigating such risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria -

The components will:\n            1) improve the quality of teaching, and learning in general\n            education, through the introduction of new standards-based\n            curriculum, and the creation of student assessments, and\n            evaluation systems instruments. The development of a\n            demand-driven system for in-service teacher training will be\n            promoted to improve national capacity; 2) improve resource\n            management in general education, by extending the Delegated\n            Budget Program by the year 2009, by strengthening the\n            Ministry of Education and Science (MES) capacity to assist\n            municipalities in optimizing schools, and, by establishing a\n            new education management information system, to provide\n            policymakers with information on the state, and progress of\n            the education system; 3) improve resource allocation to\n            higher education institutions, through a reform process, and\n            through the establishment of a national education management\n            information systems; 4) establish a student loan program,\n            and redesign the current stipend system; 5) establish a\n            competitive teaching, and management system for higher\n            education, to improve the quality of the country's\n            higher education institutions, including their internal\n            management structures; and, 6) strengthen MES capacity\n            regarding project management, and communication, to better\n            coordinate the implementation of higher education
