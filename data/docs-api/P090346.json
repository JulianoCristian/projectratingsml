Punjab is\n            Pakistan\u2019s largest province with a population of 100\n            million, which embodies 60 percent of the country's\n            total population. In the country\u2019s efforts to alleviate\n            poverty, low educational attainment had long been a\n            stumbling block. The International Development Association\n            financed Punjab Education Sector Reform Program was launched\n            in 2003 with the objective of improving access, quality, and\n            governance in the education sector. A number of reforms in\n            teachers\u2019 recruitment and professional development, textbook\n            production, and the examination system were implemented. As\n            a result, net enrollment in primary schools in Punjab has\n            increased from 45 to 62 percent between 2001 and 2007.\n            Female primary net enrollment during the same period\n            increased from 43 to 59 percent and for rural females from\n            38 to 55 percent. The Punjab government has launched a\n            second generation of reforms that focuses on increasing\n            access and completion rates, enhancing the quality of\n            reforms and student learning outcomes, and strengthening\n            school management and sector governance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -

Some lessons\n            learned included: Strong political support and government\n            ownership is essential for any program to succeed. This\n            leads to high level of monitoring and oversight. Continuity\n            of the same team over a project, including officials and\n            politicians at various tiers helps maintain momentum of\n            reforms and enhances the probability of success of a\n            program. Success of a program requires a flexible approach\n            to implementation with effective monitoring and evaluation\n            of the program during the implementation process with the\n            help of relevant data and information to identify\n            shortcomings and problem issues and be able to rectify them\n            during the course of implementation. Strong ongoing\n            analytical work helps deepen and refine policies and\n            programs. Finally, the success of any education system is\n            judged by the quality of its graduates. While quality\n            remains the core desired outcome of any education reform\n            program, it takes several years to show tangible results.\n            Therefore, education reforms require a long term commitment,\n            backed by a clear strategy for improving school level\n            performance through both quantitative and qualitative inputs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Punjab Education Reform\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Punjab Education\n            Reform Adjustment

the wide-range reform agenda of\n            the Government of Pakistan, the Second Education Sector\n            Development Policy Credit Project - Punjab Province - key\n            pillars will support: a) public finance reforms to increase\n            public spending for education (and other pro-poor services)\n            and to ensure fiscal sustainability; b) reforms that\n            strengthen devolution and improve the fiduciary environment\n            and governance; and, c) education sector reforms to improve\n            quality, access and sector governance. The main benefits\n            will be reversing the slide in education indicators,\n            bringing more children into school up to grade 8\n            (particularly poor children and girls) sooner than\n            previously expected, providing better quality education. The\n            program would contribute to closing the social gap and\n            helping the Country progress toward the Millennium\n            Development Goals (MDGs) related to poverty reduction and\n            Education for All (EFA). Another indirect, but important,\n            benefit is that the program is strengthening\n            decentralization by increasing the role of districts, and\n            promoting accountability between service users (parents and\n            students) and service providers (schools and teachers).\n            Overall, given the success of the first year program, the\n            risk rating is moderate for the second year program,\n            proposed to be supported under this project. Nevertheless,\n            there is a need to maintain continued vigilance in case of a\n            change of priorities and focus at the political level, both\n            at the province and districts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Second Education Sector\n            Development Policy Credit - Punjab Province - Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Second Education\n            Sector Development Policy Credit - Punjab Province - Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5653726/pakistan-second-education-sector-development-policy-credit-punjab-province-project","projn":"PK-Second Education Sector Development\n            Policy Credit -- P090346","docty":"Program Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050310105745"},"subsc":"General education sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"addition, civil society, civil society\n            organizations, Councils, curricula, decision making,\n            education activities, education outcomes, education\n            programs, EDUCATION SECTOR, education services, elected\n            officials, elections, Enrollment Rate, exercises,\n            Expenditures, families, FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION, gender\n            parity, GIRLS, Human Development, institutional capacity,\n            interventions, Kindergarten, leadership, learning, learning\n            achievement, LESSONS LEARNED, literacy, media, National\n            Education, NER, Net Enrollment, parents, Partnership,\n            primary school, primary school students, primary schools,\n            private sector, Procurement, provincial education,\n            provincial governments, provincial levels, public\n            expenditure, public schools, Public Sector, Public service\n            delivery, public services, public spending, quality\n            education, rural areas, school furniture, schools, service\n            delivery, service providers, Social Development,  teacher\n            training, teachers, teaching, teaching materials, textbook\n            production, textbooks, transparency"}},"owner":"S.A.
