The main objectives of the two\n            operation were to support the government's program to\n            arrest the decline of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),\n            revive growth in a sustainable and equitable manner, and\n            achieve lasting price stability. Besides supporting the\n            macroeconomic objectives, the Second ERC aimed at helping\n            the country adjust to lower levels of foreign aid and\n            establishing conditions to revive the private sector. The\n            PPAR rates the outcome of the First ERC as satisfactory, the\n            sustainability as likely, and Borrower and Bank performance\n            as satisfactory. The Second ERC met part of its goals for\n            structural reform, the labor mobility program met its\n            objectives of reducing public sector employment, the\n            privatization program achieved most of its objectives, but\n            not the transfer of PETRONIC (Petroleum) and TELCOR\n            (Telecommunications) to the private sector. The PPAR rates\n            the outcome of the Second ERC as satisfactory, the\n            sustainability as likely, the institutional development as\n            substantial, and the Borrower and Bank performance as satisfactory."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - First and Second Economic\n            Recovery Credit Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - First and Second\n            Economic Recovery Credit Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2365841/nicaragua-first-second-economic-recovery-credit-projects","projn":"NI-Econ.Rec.Cr. -- P007781,NI-Econ.
