The lessons drawn from this specific project\n            suggest, and reinforce that reforms in the industry\n            structure, and market organization require strong commitment\n            by the central government, whereas commitment by provincial\n            governments, and public participation are key to successful\n            environmental management, and population resettlement,\n            contributors to the project success. Nonetheless,\n            participation of lawyers in the preparation of bidding\n            documents, contract negotiation and implementation is\n            crucial, specifically, as legal support for claims against\n            steam turbine suppliers arose, requiring precious time and\n            resources due to lack of legal advice in drafting\n            procurement terms and conditions. And unfortunately,\n            technology transfer may become risky: despite excellent\n            references, the manufacturer of boilers fostered costly\n            delays, by improvising design options that proved\n            unsatisfactory. Pre-qualification specifications should\n            require proven references for equipment supply, not just a\n            general experience. In addition, inexperience of the\n            supplier for the coal conveying/feeding system caused\n            suspension of contract execution and major delays. It is\n            thus suggested that prompt government clearances be\n            introduced, while similarly, effective design management\n            could ensure a timely delivery of engineering

involve construction of large, coal-fired thermal\n            power plants and expansion of related transmission networks,\n            and represent a major expansion in the generating capacity\n            of their respective provinces (about 15 percent in Jiangsu\n            and 27 percent in Zhejiang). Partial credit guarantees were\n            used for both projects. The partial credit guarantee covers\n            a portion of a financing against all risks. This contrasts\n            with the partial risk guarantee, which can cover up to the\n            entire amount of a financing against specific risks. The\n            guarantees were structured to extend the maturity of\n            commercial loans and provide China with greater flexibility\n            in accessing world financial markets, e.g., interest rate\n            (fixed or floating) and currency (to match procurement\n            contracts). At the same time, the Government and Bank wished\n            to minimize their exposure under the guarantee.
