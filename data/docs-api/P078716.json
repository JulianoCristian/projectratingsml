Some lessons learned included:\n            strengthening housing finance is an important sectoral goal,\n            but it should be pursued alongside efforts to overcome\n            bottlenecks in real housing supply and demand that, if not\n            addressed, may lead to a surge in property prices, creating\n            a real estate bubble and collapse-as experience elsewhere\n            has shown. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) should be an\n            integral part of the operation it is monitoring.\n            Establishing a new M&E system or consolidating an\n            existing one should be a key prior action for an operation,\n            and trigger for subsequent operations or tranches.\n            Consigning M&E to another operation (such as a parallel\n            Technical Assistance Project in this case) increases the\n            risk of a total lack of evidence if the host operation\n            fails. Bank value-added for its clients arises when it\n            offers different advice from the local expert opinion and\n            knowledge that exist in abundance in middle-income countries\n            especially. This operation provided an opportunity for a\n            broad sector policy discussion of reform beyond the\n            parameters of Brazil's housing finance system that\n            could have been more fully exploited by the Bank. A policy\n            lending operation can usefully bring together different\n            sectoral stakeholders among whom the Bank can serve as\n            honest broker, even when sector reform

Equitable Growth : Housing Sector Reform\n            Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: government\n            participation in the analytical preparation and formulation\n            of the policy reform agenda is to ensuring long-term\n            commitment. While some specific activities within the\n            results framework did not evolve as planned, the Government\n            has shown a clear commitment, through several large scale\n            programs, to developing the housing sector based on the\n            conceptual policy guidelines espoused in the Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL). Linking housing construction to economic\n            stimulus plans is an effective and politically palatable\n            means of spurring housing construction for specific income\n            groups as well as generating employment. The launch of the\n            Minha Casa, Minha Vida stimulus package has gained broad\n            support within Brazil and will catalyze housing programs\n            identified in the National Housing Plan. The use of the\n            trust deed in housing finance instead of the traditional\n            mortgage has proven to function extremely well in a context\n            like Brazil because it provides a stronger incentive to pay\n            since title is only transferred when the loan is paid in\n            full. Indeed, loans based on trust deed in Brazil have had a\n            lower foreclosure rate than loans based on other forms of\n            security like a mortgage lien. DPLs with reform agendas that\n            require specific actions from the private sector, require\n            the identification of tools to ensure an open dialogue\n            between the public and private sectors during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Programmatic Loan for Sustainable\n            and Equitable Growth : Housing Sector Reform

objective of the Programmatic\n            Sustainable and Equitable Growth - Housing Sector Reform\n            Loan Project is to support the Government's efforts in\n            improving access by the poor to better housing and\n            serviced/serviceable land, while maintaining fiscal\n            discipline, as part of the set of loans supporting\n            sustainable and equitable growth. Brazil has witnessed\n            enormous progress in all economic and social fronts, the\n            exception being the critical situation of the shelter for\n            the poor. The Government is committed to address this\n            challenge by supporting the needs of the very poor, and the\n            development of a market that could, and should cater to the\n            less poor. This loan focuses on one key component: housing\n            sector reform. It thus deepens the reform agenda to promote\n            efficiency of the financial sector and improve economic\n            opportunity. Specifically, the project will a) develop a\n            sound national policy, and institutional framework for\n            housing and urban development; b) strengthen the housing\n            credit, and savings systems, and provide incentives for the\n            housing finance market to expand, as well as move\n            \"down-market\"; c) design and implement a unified\n            federal housing subsidy system, to address the affordability\n            of housing solutions for the poor; and, d) reduce the costs\n            of formal, urban land development, by strengthening land\n            legislation, regulations, and real property registries. In\n            spite of several risks to this operation, namely, timing and\n            expectations, coordination and institutional risks, and,\n            macroeconomic developments and interest rate volatility, the\n            Government's commitment to pursue its fiscal adjustment\n            policy, should lead to a decline in overall debt and lower\n            market interest rates. Furthermore, the program provides a\n            conceptual framework to help the Government monitor the\n            segments of the housing market, including those relevant for\n            poor and middle-income families."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
