provision of training; and, the provision of technical\n            assistance and studies to assist in development of\n            Bangladesh's energy resources, including a pilot\n            project to test utilization of compressed natural gas (CNG)\n            as an automotive fuel. The project would assist Bangladesh\n            in reducing its present over-dependence on imported oil and\n            petroleum products through the replacement of liquid\n            hydrocarbons with indigenous natural gas and would make\n            available the use of gas as a feedback for fertilizer production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Bakhrabad Gas Development
