Malaria Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Malaria Control Project\n            for India were as follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: With the benefit of hindsight, the overall project\n            was overambitious. The managerial capacity of the\n            implementing agency was not given sufficient attention\n            during project design. The monitoring and evaluation\n            framework was not sufficiently developed. Task Teams and\n            Management should be responsive to changing needs of the\n            project and restructure accordingly. Suspension and\n            restructuring of the project, though late, were crucial for\n            the success of the project. Strong leadership is an\n            important but not necessary condition for success. Nurturing\n            ownership of states, which are at cutting edge of\n            implementation, is critical for program success. Identifying\n            and adequately addressing procurement and supply chain\n            logistics up-front is critical for the success of the Vector\n            Borne Disease Control Program (VBDCP). Strengthening program\n            management at district and state levels is essential for\n            successful decentralization. Program monitoring needs\n            further strengthening by incorporating objectively\n            verifiable process and output indicators and establishing a\n            system of data triangulation by experts complemented by well\n            targeted surveys and supportive supervision.

Accidental release of\n            organophosphorus insecticides into lakes, rivers, and other\n            water bodies may exert toxic effects on fish and small\n            aquatic organisms before degradation is complete. Carbamate\n            insecticides generally are highly toxic to honeybees.\n            Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides are highly toxic to both\n            fish and honeybees. Mitigation measures arise from chemical\n            use that is focally applied (selective areas); seasonally\n            applied (limited to the seasons in which peak disease\n            transmission or pest nuisance occurs); partially applied to\n            selected resting sites (certain areas in the house); and\n            partially applied to bed-nets, curtains, and traps. To avoid\n            increasing health risks (vector resistance) and releasing\n            insecticides into the environment resulting from improper\n            insecticide use, several different insecticides in rotation\n            are proposed. Further, vector control options available are\n            to: use indoor residual spraying (where only the inner walls\n            and roofs of houses are sprayed), take personal protection\n            measures, and conduct larviciding. Appropriate precautions\n            must be taken in the packaging, handling, and disposal of\n            insecticides. To eliminate accidental release during\n            transport and storage, local packaginghave to conform to\n            government and internationally-accepted standards, and the\n            empty containers should be treated as hazardous wastes. Date\n            expired insecticides will be sent to a secure landfill.\n            Wherever synthetic pyrethroids are used, care should be\n            taken to avoid their spillage into surface water as these\n            are extremely toxic to fish, and to avoid their release into\n            places where honeybee cultivation is taking place. Local\n            authorities responsible for distributing these insecticides\n            should know about their chemical toxicity, and possess\n            protective clothing and equipment, ensure clear and durable\n            labeling on all packages depicting their hazardous nature.\n            To discourage recycling of containers, the government should\n            encourage manufacturers to use nonreusable containers.\n            Spills generated during impregnation of bednets and curtains\n            should be collected, and after mixing with the washings of\n            the empty insecticide containers, need to be chemically\n            destroyed in situ. Workers engaged in the impregnation\n            operation should wear gloves and masks to avoid skin contact\n            with insecticides and inhalation exposure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Malaria Control Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Malaria Control Project :\n            environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/12/441331/india-malaria-control-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"IN-Malaria Control -- P010511","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Malaria,m,Environment and Health","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"India","authors":{"authr":"National Environmental Engineering Research\n            Institute, Nehru Marg, Nagpur"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980420171352"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Active Case Detection,adult\n            mosquito,chemical larvicides,cities,clinical\n            malaria,community participation,deaths,decision\n            making,Disease Vector Control,diseases,drinking\n            water,Emergency Preparedness,environmental\n            conditions,Environmental Management,environmental\n            pollution,epidemics,epidemiologic data,falciparum\n            infection,hazardous chemicals,Health\n            Sector,infection,insecticide\n            resistance,Insecticides,intervention,Laboratory\n            diagnosis,larvivorous fish,latrines,laws,Malaria,malaria\n            cases,Malaria Control Activities,malaria control\n            efforts,Malaria Control Methods,Malaria Control\n            Strategies,malaria epidemics,Malaria Eradication,malaria\n            incidence,malaria morbidity,malaria problem,Malaria\n            Research,malaria vectors,malarious\n            areas,morbidity,mortality,Mosquito Control,mosquito\n            larvae,mosquito nets,National Malaria Control,nets,Passive\n            Case Detection,Pesticides,physicians,Pollution,primary\n            health care,rainfall,Residual\n            Spraying,Safety,sanitation,screening,septic tanks,social\n            issues,Synthetic Pyrethroids,towns,Vector Control,Vector\n            Control Measures,Vector Resistance,vector-borne diseases,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"Active Case Detection,adult\n            mosquito,chemical larvicides,cities,clinical\n            malaria,community participation,deaths,decision\n            making,Disease Vector Control,diseases,drinking\n            water,Emergency Preparedness,environmental\n            conditions,Environmental Management,environmental\n            pollution,epidemics,epidemiologic data,falciparum\n            infection,hazardous chemicals,Health\n            Sector,infection,insecticide\n            resistance,Insecticides,intervention,Laboratory\n            diagnosis,larvivorous fish,latrines,laws,Malaria,malaria\n            cases,Malaria Control Activities,malaria control\n            efforts,Malaria Control Methods,Malaria Control\n            Strategies,malaria epidemics,Malaria Eradication,malaria\n            incidence,malaria morbidity,malaria problem,Malaria\n            Research,malaria vectors,malarious\n            areas,morbidity,mortality,Mosquito Control,mosquito\n            larvae,mosquito nets,National Malaria Control,nets,Passive\n            Case Detection,Pesticides,physicians,Pollution,primary\n            health care,rainfall,Residual\n            Spraying,Safety,sanitation,screening,septic tanks,social\n            issues,Synthetic Pyrethroids,towns,Vector Control,Vector\n            Control Measures,Vector Resistance,vector-borne diseases,waste"}},"owner":"S.A.
