Some lessons learned included: it\n            is recommended that all future projects enable the use of a\n            designated account as a mode of disbursement and budget\n            should be made available to directly fund staff under the\n            project; (ii) a detailed procurement plan should be\n            established at appraisal for all key components of the\n            project, especially those that directly impact the timing of\n            other project components (such as equipment purchase, key\n            contracts); (iii) Terms of Reference, or TOR specifications\n            should incorporate close and continued technical supervision\n            to avoid delays and/or misunderstandings; and (iv) technical\n            review of the project should run throughout project\n            implementation and include aspects for quality control. The\n            CAP communication plan was funded by a Global Facility for\n            Disaster Reduction and Recovery, or GFDRR grant. It was\n            found that this helped to regularly disseminate the results\n            of the project, facilitate knowledge transfer, boost\n            coordination and inform future activities. It is highly\n            recommended that all future projects incorporate a\n            communication/dissemination plan. The remote sensing\n            technologies and modelling methods used in the project have\n            been tested in the CAP, and can be replicated for other\n            regions in Guyana or in other Caribbean countries with\n            similar situations. Development of a technical foundation\n            for risk analysis conducive to rationalizing key-investment\n            strategies is a necessary step in reducing flood risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana -

In 2005, extreme rainfall caused\n            devastang flooding along these coastal lowlands, with many\n            areas remaining inundated for up to three weeks. The flood\n            highlighted the vulnerability of the EDWC dam to overtopping\n            and potential breaching. The Conservancy Adaptation Project\n            (CAP) was conceived in the wake of the 2005 flood to help\n            the Government of Guyana adapt to the threats posed by\n            future climate change. The aim was to reduce the likelihood\n            of catastrophic flooding along Guyana's low-lying\n            coastal areas, also threatened by sea level rise. The\n            project identified key investments totaling over US$ 123\n            million. These are being used by the Government to update\n            the national master-plan strategy for drainage and\n            irrigation and to plan future investment programs for\n            reducing flood risk."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Managing flood risk in Guyana : the\n            Conservancy Adaptation Project (2008-2013)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Managing flood risk in Guyana :\n            the Conservancy Adaptation Project (2008-2013)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2013/12/19356954/managing-flood-risk-guyana-conservancy-adaptation-project-2008-2013","count":"Guyana","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aerial photography, bathymetry, canals,\n            catchment, catchment areas, channel, Channel Network,\n            channels, clay, Climate Change, climate data, clouds,\n            coastal areas, components, computer models, computers,\n            covering, culverts, dam safety, dams, data management,\n            decision makers, Digital, discharge, Drainage, drainage\n            systems, drains, embankments, engineering, equipment, flood\n            control, flood management, Flood Risk, flooding, floods,\n            Flow gauging, gravity, high water, hydraulic engineering,\n            hydrological network, Irrigation, logging, measurements,\n            meteorological data, navigation, pressure, programs,\n            pumping, pumps, rain, rainfall, rainy seasons, relief\n            channel, remote sensing, return period, river flow,\n            scanning, SDI, sea, sea level rise, sensors, soil types,\n            telemetry, water control structures, water drainage, water\n            level, water levels, water storage"}},"majtheme":"Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management","projn":"GY-Conservancy Adaptation Project -- P103539","docty":"Working Paper","subtopic":"Water Supply and Systems,Water Law,Technology Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation","teratopic":"Water Resources,Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation","authors":{"authr":"Bovolo, Isabella"},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20140408125234"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Central government administration,Flood protection","theme":"Natural disaster management,Water resource management","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Industry,Water Supply and Sanitation","prdln":"Global Environment Project","owner":"Disaster Risk Management & Urban (LCSDU)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"TF013119-Guyana: Strengthening\n            Guyana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Coastal Lands Information Systems a,TF058177-GEF FSP -

This\n            project has been developed to guide a comprehensive\n            upgrading program of the East Demerara Water Conservancy\n            (EDWC) and lowland drainage system, aimed at increasing\n            discharge capacity and improving water level management. The\n            project will also provide a technical framework for future\n            donor intervention in the drainage and irrigation sector. In\n            addition to developing the technical baseline for adaptation\n            measures, the project will include some small infrastructure\n            improvements to help cope with the immediate threats to the\n            drainage system. The tools developed under the analytical\n            component of the CAP will be used by the Government of the\n            Republic of Guyana (GoG) and donor agencies to guide future\n            investments. There are three components to the project. The\n            first component is the pre-investment studies for\n            engineering design of works. The objective of this component\n            is to provide the hydrologic baseline necessary for\n            contemplating rational interventions aimed at increasing the\n            current discharge capacity of the flood control system. The\n            second component is the investments in specific adaptation\n            measures. The objective of this component is to counteract\n            the effects of sea level rise, which has decreased the\n            GoG's ability to manage water levels of the EDWC\n            system. The third component is the institutional\n            strengthening and project management. The objective of this\n            component is to strengthen the institutional framework for\n            flood control within the context of the national emergency\n            management sector headed by the civil defense commission.\n            The project will also support an institutional consolidation\n            of flood control in Guyana to help create consensus around a\n            medium and long term intervention strategy to help the\n            country adapt to sea level rise"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Conservancy Adaptation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guyana - Conservancy Adaptation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/09/8380684/guyana-conservancy-adaptation-project","projn":"GY-Conservancy Adaptation Project -- P103539","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Water Supply and Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Hazard Risk Management","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Development,Water Resources","count":"Guyana","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000310607_20070927095909"},"subsc":"Flood protection","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Development,Water Resources","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accidents, aerial photography, agricultural\n            activities, agricultural production, Bathymetry, canals,\n            capacity building, catastrophic event, catchment, Channel,\n            Civil Defense, clay, CLIMATE CHANGE, coastal water, coastal\n            zones, community participation, Conservation, Contingency\n            plan, cost effectiveness, creeks, damages, Dams, death toll,\n            decision making, delta regions, deltas, disaster management,\n            disaster preparation, disasters, discharge, Drainage,\n            drainage channels, drainage systems, drinking water,\n            drinking water supply, drought, droughts, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,\n            El Nino, emergencies, Emergency Assistance, emergency\n            management, emissions, emissions abatement, engineering,\n            Environmental, environmental impact, environmental impact\n            assessment, environmental impacts, Environmental Management,\n            Environmental Protection, evaporation, Exchange Rate,\n            export, farmers, fire, fires, Flood, flood control, flood\n            management, Flood protection, Flood Risk, flooding, floods,\n            flow rate, freshwater, global climate change, gravity,\n            greenhouse gases, grid system, heavy rainfall, high tide,\n            high water, hydraulic engineering, Hydraulics, hydrologic\n            conditions, ICZM, impoundment, Indigenous Peoples,\n            Information System, intervention strategy, irrigation,\n            irrigation systems, Land reclamation, Land use, land use\n            management, levees, low tide, Measurements, melt water,\n            Meteorological Office, monitoring equipment, monitoring\n            stations, national emergency, Natural disaster,\n            negotiations, population densities, potable water,\n            precipitation, pressure, productivity, programs, pumps,\n            rain, rainfall, Rainfall Intensity, rainwater, rainy\n            seasons, regional development, relief, replacement costs,\n            rivers, runoff, Safety, sea, sea level rise, sluice gates,\n            social costs, South America, spring, storm, surface\n            temperature, Sustainable Development, transparency, Trinidad\n            and Tobago, United States Agency for International\n            Development, water control structures, water flows, water\n            level, water levels, water management, water management\n            systems, water projects, water quality, water resources,\n            Water Sector, water storage, water supply, water use,\n            waterflow, waters, watershed, Waterways, weather events,\n            weather patterns"}},"owner":"Urban (LCSUW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"repnb":"39120"},"facets":{}}}
