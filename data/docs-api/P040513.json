The\n            western part of the road, the Luoyang-Sanmenxia Expressway,\n            is located to the south of the Yellow River in Henan\n            province, and is the focus of the present Environmental\n            Assessment (EA). This report finds that the road's\n            construction will have some adverse effects on the\n            surrounding environment; construction will lead to more\n            water and soil loss in the area; blown dust and asphalt\n            smoke may impact the environment; noise will affect the\n            residential sites in the vicinity; and flora and indigenous\n            animal species will be affected.  None of the plant or\n            animal species in this area, however, is considered rare or\n            endangered.
