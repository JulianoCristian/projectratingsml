Some of\n            the main lessons from these projects suggest that: The\n            ethnic divide, distrust, and governance problems, are the\n            key constraints to improving the environment for private\n            sector development (PSD), and fostering sustainable growth\n            in Guyana. At the project level, all future Bank operations,\n            including their components and processes (e.g. consultations\n            on project design, hiring of consultants, procurement,\n            selection of trainees, choice of regulatory options, etc.),\n            should address the way to at least, avoid deepening\n            distrust, and if possible, serve to build trust across the\n            racial divide. Transparency should be the key watchword for\n            both the Government, and donors. In addition, more\n            diagnostic work on incentives, institutions, and social\n            capital is needed, with a view to identifying strategies,\n            and tactics for rationalizing incentives, building\n            sustainable institutions, and fostering social capital.\n            Understanding the political economy is essential to project\n            choice, and design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana -

On the other hand, the restructuring of\n            the new Guyana National Cooperative Bank was unsatisfactory;\n            and the goal of enhancing the business environment was\n            adjudged marginally unsatisfactory. Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances were satisfactory overall. The\n            following are the main lessons learned: Inter-agency\n            arrangements both financial and institutional and, in\n            particular, the absence of documentation delayed the\n            privatization process. Wide disparity in the value of the\n            same asset base made it difficult for the Privatization Unit\n            to arrive at the true value of enterprise assets. Although\n            worker participation was a key objective, the financial\n            status of many workers and the large asset base of most\n            enterprises made this difficult. The investment agency\n            (GO-INVEST) has not been as effective as expected due to\n            several changes in the leadership, thereby delaying capacity\n            building. When the financial situation of the newly merged\n            Guyana National Cooperative Bank (GNCB) deteriorated, the\n            government decided to contract a new management team, which\n            has been able to stem further losses of the bank's portfolio."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Financial Sector and Business\n            Environment
