Some lessons learned\n            included: flexibility during project design and\n            implementation is critical to successful outcomes. When a\n            project is designed, it is not possible to envision all\n            potential scenarios. Being able to change activities and add\n            resources in response to changing circumstances is\n            essential. Stronger attention to monitoring and evaluation\n            is needed to demonstrate the sustainability and long-term\n            impact of credit lines, particularly after a decade of using\n            a broadly similar approach. Implementation support missions\n            work best when they include regular field visits to bank\n            branches and beneficiaries. The feedback from beneficiaries\n            was especially instructive in evaluating the performance of\n            development partners. During the life of the project, the\n            simplicity of the design and the experience gained by the\n            banks contributed to their ability to attract additional\n            financing from other international financial institutions.\n            Co-financing arrangements ensure that the participating\n            financial institution complements borrowed funds with\n            resources from its own balance sheet. In the face of limited\n            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)\n            resources, leveraging funds through such instrument should\n            be encouraged whenever possible. As desirable as it is to\n            ensure that traditionally underserved regions are carefully\n            considered for such projects, the focus needs to be on\n            providing relevant information, improving access, and giving\n            special consideration to the loan application process rather\n            than on imposing regional lending targets or quotas.\n            Allowing both banks to lend to the entire country provided\n            them with greater flexibility to place loans and increase\n            competition, which in turn helped achieve the project's\n            objectives. Upfront training and capacity building on World\n            Bank fiduciary standards for environmental, procurement, and\n            financial management is essential for efficient delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Access to Finance for Small and\n            Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Access to Finance for\n
