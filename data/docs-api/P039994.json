The lessons learned included: 1)\n            The Bank needs to strike a better balance between Program\n            goals, the design of Program instruments, and a\n            country's political realities; 2) The complexity of\n            design and the number of operations in a Program should be\n            consistent with the risks to development outcomes; 3) It is\n            best to be more conservative in assessing borrower's\n            capacity to implement reforms and thus be less ambitious in\n            Program design; 4) and 4) Financial sector reform Programs\n

- Programmatic Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Financial Sector Adjustment Loan\n            Project seeks to strengthen the financial condition of the\n            private, and public banking sector, in order to reduce\n            vulnerability to future shocks, and negative impacts on\n            economic growth. The project will provide financial support\n            to the Government of Paraguay for the formulation, and\n            approval of key financial sector laws and regulations,\n            including the implementation of the recently approved\n            deposit insurance and banking resolution law, new loan loss\n            provisioning regulations, revision of the general banking\n            law, approval of a new anti-money laundering law, as well as\n            approval of a law to restructure the state owned banks. The\n            rationalization of the public banking component, is\n            primarily geared towards improving access to credit by the\n            micro, and small rural, and agricultural businesses, by\n            inter alia, limiting first tier public lending to these\n            sectors, and excluding large corporate borrowers from\n            preferential lending. For the banking system, the\n            implementation of bank resolution and deposit insurance\n            schemes will, as a priority, protect the smallest depositors\n            with the least economic assets, and assure prompt repayment.\n            Main risks pertain to political, macroeconomic, governance\n            and institutional capacity. The main risk is that Congress\n            will not approve some of the key legislation supported by\n            this operation, in particular, the restructuring of the\n            state banks, which would undermine the adjustment program.\n            Stricter capital and provisioning regulations may lead to\n            further contraction in commercial bank credit available to\n            the private sector, especially if the macroeconomic\n            environment is less conducive to improvements in banks'\n            financial condition. A public information campaign and\n            consultation with the banking industry would encourage\n            participation in the reforms, as well as a gradual phasing\n            in of some reforms, such as the increase in base capital,\n            and loan loss provisioning requirements. Institutional\n            capacity constraints are being mitigated with the support of\n            an accompanying technical assistance loan. Governance risks\n            are being addressed through the implementation of audits of\n            state institutions, involved in the reforms, the\n            continuation of the Government's public transparency\n            campaign, and the implementation of the new anti-money\n            laundering legislation, to prevent the flow of illicit\n            funds, under more effective institutional arrangements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Paraguay - Programmatic Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Paraguay - Programmatic Financial\n
