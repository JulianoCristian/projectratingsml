Lessons indicate that\n            private sector financial intermediaries can be a source of\n            municipal finance under the right conditions, for although\n            the Territorial Development Bank (FINDETER), did manage to\n            leverage a percentage of project costs from financial\n            intermediaries, most of these were public-sector financial\n            intermediaries; thus, it is expected that the follow-up\n            operation will emphasize more on private-sector banks\n            participation. However, given that private sector lenders\n            need stronger initial guarantees for municipal loans, an\n            over-dependence upon such guarantees should be avoided,\n            rather the emphasis should be on financially stronger\n            municipalities. Moreover, the role of the private sector in\n            the provision of urban services should be integral to\n            infrastructure investments, and, in addition, consideration\n            by the Bank, and donors on the appropriate technology,\n            should be carefully designed into the lending program.\n            Experience suggests that private sector participation with\n            water utilities require strong municipal commitments, and be\n            a precondition to reach agreement on tariffs, and subsidy\n            structures. Also reinforced is the need for a flexible\n            framework regarding key activities, for a single consultant\n            preparing each procurement package to improve consistency,\n            and, for standardizing the use of financial models for the\n            analysis of new private sector managed utilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
