Key lessons\n            convey that common development objectives between the Bank,\n            and Borrower are critical to pursue project implementation,\n            and, that the Bank should ensure the appropriate\n            implementation arrangements, particularly with implementing\n            agencies. Specifically, in light of active participation of\n            agencies (other than the Implementing Agency) separate\n            Project Agreements, or comparable arrangements could\n            authorize the Bank - should default occur - to suspend\n            disbursements in the absence of compliance. Indeed, direct\n            contractual agreements should be pursued with those entities\n            that have the mandate to fulfill the requirements needed to\n            meet the project's objective, and, the scope of these\n            objectives must not be broader than the scope of the\n            Borrower's operational capacity. Lack of clear leverage\n            by the Bank, precluded the adherence of the implementing\n            agency to both the implementation plan, and agreements\n            (partly also because of the Borrower's financial\n            capacity to undertake such a program on its own). Such being\n            the case, the Bank should seek to expand the stake in the\n            fulfillment of agreed actions, by including communities to\n            form a wider range of stakeholders, who would then be\n            empowered, and, responsible to sustain resources productively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Environmental Conservation and\n            Rehabilitation

ecologically sensitive areas in CVRD's area of\n            influence; 4) studies, research, training, and technical\n            assistance, including a comprehensive impact assessment of\n            the Tubarao industrial port, other pollution monitoring and\n            impact studies; 5) implementation of a comprehensive\n            corporate environmental information, control, monitoring

The components of this\n            project  are: 1) air, water and soil pollution control and\n            land reclamation investments in CVRD's mining,\n            industrial, rail and port operations throughout the country;\n            2) natural resource investments (reforestation, conservation\n            of natural forest and ecosystems and fauna and flora\n            inventories and conservation); 3) socially oriented\n            investments (municipal improvements and the Amerindian\n            program); 4) studies, research, training, and technical\n            assistance; 5) implementation of a comprehensive corporate\n            environmental information, control, monitoring and auditing\n            system; 6) erosion control in mines and along the railroad;\n            and 7) environmental impact assessments in the project\n            's areas of influence.  The project  will have a\n            positive impact on the environment and especially on the\n            many indigenous peoples who live in the region. Most\n            directly affected by the project are: 1) the Xikrin of\n            Catete, whose reservation borders directly on the CVRD\n            mining concession; 2) the Gaviao of Mae Maria, whose\n            reservation is crossed by the railway line; 3) the Gaujajara\n            of Pindare and Caru, whose reservations lie very near the\n            railway; and 4) the Awa, who will be provided with\n            protection and medical care.  The project  will\n            substantially improve the conditions of indigenous\n            communities, particularly in terms of health care and land\n            demarcation.  Future support for tribal communities should\n            concentrate on the demarcation and protection of reserves,\n            the provision of health services, and educational campaigns\n            designed to prepare tribal communities to better manage,\n            protect and develop the natural and other resources\n            available to them for their own benefit.  The project should\n            also: 1) progressively reduce dependence on its actions and\n            funding, by promoting self reliance and community\n            participation; 2) remove itself from involvement in day to\n            day management of the program by acting through other\n            institutions/organizations; 3) finance actions which have\n            been designed with the active involvement and support of the\n            community; and 4) emphasize actions which will eventually\n            lead to self sufficiency and which incorporate ways to\n            achieve self management and financial self sufficiency in\n            their design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Environmental Conservation and\n            Rehabilitation Project - summary of environmental
