Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, granting greater management responsibility\n            in exchange for a performance-based approach to technical\n            assistance could have offered better prospects. Second, in\n            the future, GOG should only agree to measures which are\n            within its capacity to execute and the Bank should be more\n            circumspect in accepting such assurances at face value.\n            Finally, IDA played a crucial role in bringing about\n            fundamental sector reforms.
