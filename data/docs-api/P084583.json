The price per house under this project is\n            about US$4,000, compared to an average of more than US$6,000\n            for houses provided by NGOs and bilateral donors. Yet,\n            villagers are choosing these houses on the grounds that they\n            control the process. However, unit prices will need to be\n            adjusted shortly to take into consideration local inflation.\n            The project objective is to rebuild and repair houses in 188\n            villages and urban neighborhoods through community-driven\n            processes. The project works through the World Bank\u0092s\n            community-driven Urban Poverty Project that establishes\n            elected community development boards. The project provides\n            grants to communities and for basic infrastructure. The\n            infrastructure grants component has just been stocked up to\n            meet the reconstruction needs in supported villages. One of\n            few housing projects that focuses on repair as well as reconstruction."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Community-based settlement rehabilitation\n            and

As a highly decentralized, and community-based demand\n            driven project, it will support a large number of small\n            subproject investments, mainly in urban areas, while the\n            participatory nature of this project, should guarantee that\n            people affected by project implementation will be involved\n            in the decision making process. The design of the project\n            therefore ensures the participation, and inclusion of all\n            groups, including indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities,\n            and, recognizes that isolated vulnerable people form a group\n            that merits specific support. This Indigenous Peoples Plan\n            (IPP) ensures that such groups do benefit from the project,\n            and seeks to avoid, or minimize as possible, adverse effects\n            on isolated and vulnerable people. Facilitator training\n            shall provide the tools and mechanisms on how to organize,\n            and work with vulnerable groups, including the ability to\n            communicate in the appropriate language. It is expected a\n            full participation, and awareness of their rights and\n            responsibilities, in order to voice their needs. Monitoring\n            criteria and grievance mechanisms will be established, to\n            ensure compliance with this framework, and responsiveness\n            should conflict occur, respectively."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
