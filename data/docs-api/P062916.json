There is only a\n            reallocation of funds from an existing component to support\n            three new activities that are nevertheless consistent with\n            Bangladesh Bank's (BB's) priority reform agenda\n            which this project is supporting. The three new activities\n            are: (i) National Payment Switch (NPS) and e-Payment\n            Gateway, (ii) IT System for Anti-Money Laundering Department\n            (AMLD) for Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STR) and Cash\n            Transaction Reporting (CTR), and (iii) system for Public\n            Accounts Department (PAD). International Development\n            Association (IDA) has agreed to finance National Payment\n            Switch (NPS) and e-Payment Gateway 100 percent of the\n            expenditure up to a maximum amount of SDR3.8149 million (USD\n            6.0 million). A separate sub-category under (one) goods will\n            be created for this activity. The three new activities will\n            contribute substantially toward achievement of the PDO and\n            PDO output and outcome indicators."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data
