Some lessons\n            learned included: the most prominent and positive message is\n            that, with the strong ownership from government leaders and\n            civil servants, in both the center and regions, and with\n            sustained and adequate budgeting, conditional cash transfers\n            (CCT) can succeed in reducing the vulnerability of poor\n            households and in maintaining their investments in their\n            children's health and education. Even in situations\n            like Turkey's in which specific income/consumption data\n            is not available at the outset, proxies can be rapidly\n            developed that lead to an overall good targeting outcome.\n            The project implementation experience also offers an\n            interesting lesson regarding the use of policy\n            conditionality linked to investment operations. The use of\n            such conditionality, especially when it comes to emergency\n            type operations like the SRMP, will need to be carefully\n            weighed with respect to both feasibility and operational\n            implications. For the SRMP, the originally specified\n            disbursement condition (the restructuring of the\n            implementing institution), turned out to be not a binding\n            restriction for the successful start-up of the program. The\n            other notable lesson concerns the costs of not monitoring of\n            the most meaningful outcomes, in particular in challenging\n            areas such as small loans and employability training. The\n            project did not measure outcomes, such as profitability of\n            the income-generating activities, so there was no reasonable\n            basis to discuss mid-course changes in this component with\n            the government. The project did not follow graduates after\n            they were placed in employment, which leaves little basis\n            for discussion of changes in, for instance, types of training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Social Risk Mitigation Project (SRMP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Social Risk Mitigation\n            Project

: Pocket money for school and a way\n            out of poverty"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"In February 2005, Cinar Turk, an\n            illiterate 34-year old mother of three, took a minibus down\n            a winding road from her village of Camliyamac, in a\n            mountainous corner of eastern Anatolia, to a small office\n            building in Uzundere, the nearest town. There, she presented\n            a piece of paper to an official, pronounced her name and\n            received 120 new Turkish lira (roughly 90 dollars) from the\n            state. The amount was modest but for Turk it meant\n            everything \u0096 a critical helping hand to send her two teenage\n            daughters and 9-year-old son to school. \u0093It\u0092s money we can\n            spend on pencils, shoes and uniforms, so the children don\u0092t\n            feel humiliated at school,\u0094 she says, recalling the\n            transaction. Just back from school, her daughter Sarga, 13,\n            hands neatly resting on her grey pleated skirt, sits proudly\n            by her side. In an effort to tackle poverty and improve\n            living standards for the next generation, the Turkish\n            government has helped tens of thousands of mothers cover\n            essential child-rearing expenses under the Social Risk\n            Mitigation Project, financed by a World Bank loan. The\n            handouts known as Conditional Cash Transfers go to the\n            poorest six percent of households, provided parents send\n            their children to school or have them vaccinated when\n            they\u0092re young. As of October 2005, this assistance had\n            reached 1.9 million (roughly nine out of 10) of the poorest\n            children in Turkey. The Social Risk Mitigation Project\u0092s\n            initial goal was to soften the impact of Turkey\u0092s 2001\n            economic crisis on poor households with emergency\n            assistance, and improve their capability to cope with\n            similar risks in the future. In the process, the project has\n            strengthened a network of 931 state-run Social Solidarity\n            Foundations that are now better able to reach out to the\n            poor, identify their needs and improve their prospects.\n            Foundations, which used to distribute food and other\n            benefits on an ad hoc basis, now have access to a\n            computerized system and a clearly defined target group."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey : Pocket money for school and a way\n            out of poverty"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey : Pocket money for school\n            and a way out of poverty"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/03/23979776/turkey-pocket-money-school-way-out-poverty","count":"Turkey","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"attendance records, basic education, crime,\n            families, female, female illiteracy, girls, husband,\n            husbands, jobs, literacy classes, mentally disabled, remote\n            villages, school attendance, School Project, school\n            rehabilitation, vocational school, widow, will"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Adjustment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Social protection and risk management,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Disability Allowance m1326051 1636,Education Access and Equity m1327050 2127,Education and Gender m1326343 1545,Primary Education m1326139 480,Education for All m1327049 1467","projn":"TR-Social Risk Mitigation Project (Srmp) -- P074408","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Disability,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Gender and Law,Primary Education,Education For All","teratopic":"Gender,Social Protections and Labor,Education","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150210093100"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health,General industry and trade sector,General education sector","theme":"Education for all,Social Safety Nets/Social Assistance &\n            Social Care Services,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Improving labor markets","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Gender,Social Protections and Labor,Education","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Disability Allowance m1326051 1636,Education Access and Equity m1327050 2127,Education and Gender m1326343 1545,Primary Education m1326139 480,Education for All m1327049 1467","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["F"],"trustfund":"BBLRN-BB LEARNING,TF026884-PHRD-TURKEY: SOCIAL RISK MITIGATION,TF053549-JSDF SEED-TURKEY: DISADVANTAGED\n            CHILDREN AND YOUTH,TF054459-TURKEY -

Disbursements for assistance\n            programs include school materials, and textbooks;\n            pharmaceuticals, and medical supplies; and, expansion of\n            social assistance programs.
