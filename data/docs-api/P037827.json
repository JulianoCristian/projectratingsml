A major achievement of the\n            project was strengthening NGO-government partnerships in\n            primary health care. Lessons learned include the following:\n            Key partner NGOs with proven competencies were identified\n            early and were fully involved in the design phase.\n            Government ownership is also fundamental to sustainability\n            of NGO involvement. The experience of the participatory\n            component underlines the need to pay greater attention to\n            practical difficulties in operationalizing community\n            involvement in planning, supervision, and monitoring of\n            government health services. The limited success achieved in\n            the in-service training program is partly attributable to\n            the culture of planning in the country whereby completion of\n            physical infrastructure precedes recruitment of staff and\n            other related inputs. As a result, software components are\n            often delayed or compressed at a late stage of the project.\n            A critical lesson learned was the need to involve the\n            Ministries of Finance and Planning during preparation which\n            is particularly important from the perspective of\n            sustainability of recurrent costs. Careful assessment of\n            financial management capacity of implementing agencies needs\n            to be undertaken during project preparation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Northern Health Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan - Northern Health\n            Program Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1561421/pakistan-northern-health-program-project","projn":"PK-Northern Health -- P037827","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Pakistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01083004024921"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration,Other social services","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accidents,aged,ambulances,antenatal\n            care,blister packs,child health\n            services,clinics,communities,community\n            participation,decentralization,decision making,development\n            activities,Disease\n            Control,Dispensaries,districts,doctors,equipment,expenditures,Family\n            Planning,financial management,Health Centres,Health\n            clinics,Health Committees,health education,health\n            facilities,health outcomes,health policies,Health\n            Policy,health promotion,health sector,Health Services,health\n            status,health system,hospitals,hostels,immunization,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rate,infant mortality\n            rates,institutionalization,integration,intervention,Leprosy,managers,medicines,midwifery,mobility,Mortality,motivation,NGOs,nursing,NUTRITION,paramedics,partnership,patients,performance\n            indicators,polio,pregnant women,preventive health\n            care,primary health care,private sector,public health,public\n            sector,rural development,rural women,schools,social services,supervision,surgery,Sustainability,transport,villages,Workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"accidents,aged,ambulances,antenatal\n            care,blister packs,child health\n            services,clinics,communities,community\n            participation,decentralization,decision making,development\n            activities,Disease\n            Control,Dispensaries,districts,doctors,equipment,expenditures,Family\n            Planning,financial management,Health Centres,Health\n            clinics,Health Committees,health education,health\n            facilities,health outcomes,health policies,Health\n            Policy,health promotion,health sector,Health Services,health\n            status,health system,hospitals,hostels,immunization,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rate,infant mortality\n            rates,institutionalization,integration,intervention,Leprosy,managers,medicines,midwifery,mobility,Mortality,motivation,NGOs,nursing,NUTRITION,paramedics,partnership,patients,performance\n            indicators,polio,pregnant women,preventive health\n            care,primary health care,private sector,public health,public\n            sector,rural development,rural women,schools,social services,supervision,surgery,Sustainability,transport,villages,Workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
