While the\n            second phase (PISE II), with the same key objectives, ended\n            in December 2009, today, Mali is preparing the third phase\n            of the Sector Program (2010-2012). It is in this context\n            that this report has been prepared, complementing other\n            thematic studies (management of the flow of pupils, training\n            and deployment of teaching staff, decentralization of\n            education, curricula) to propose a review of the status of\n            the Malian education system and offer national\n            decision-makers and their development partners a solid\n            analytical basis to inform the political dialogue and the\n            decision-making process. The report shows that demographic\n            pressure is fairly high and represents a huge challenge for\n            Mali\u0092s education system. Further demographic pressure is\n            fairly high and represents a huge challenge for Mali\u0092s\n            education system and enabled an increase in government\n            resources while education has risen on the list of national\n            priorities. External resources have also increased but\n            intra-sector distribution of resources is not sufficiently\n            in favor of primary education. Private expenditure on\n            education represented 16 percent of all education\n            expenditure in 2008 yet schooling coverage has greatly\n            improved over recent years. However, school access is not\n            yet universal and there is still a considerable amount of\n            drop-out at all levels of education with drop-out and\n            repetition contributing to the system\u0092s poor internal\n            effectiveness. The quality of learning is poor and many\n            children are already underachieving in the course of primary\n            education. Moreover, there are considerable disparities in\n            enrollments according to gender and place of residence but\n            the household\u0092s standard of living is the largest\n            discriminatory factor in enrollments. The study added that\n            75 percent of public resources allocated to education\n            benefit the 20 percent wealthiest and the regional\n            disparities are also high: the North is behind compared to\n            the rest of the country. Unit costs in terms of GDP per\n            capita have decreased at all levels of education, owing to\n            enrollments increasing more rapidly than the budget.\n            Student-teacher ratios are too high with considerable\n            variability in the status of teaching personnel and their\n            levels of salary. Government allocation of teachers and\n            textbooks to schools is not sufficiently related to\n            enrollments and pedagogical management is also poor and\n            Incompatibility between education system leavers and the\n            labor market is problematic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif malien : Analyse\n            sectorielle pour une am\u00e9lioration de la qualit\u00e9 et de l\u0092effi\n            cacit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif malien\u00a0:\n            analyse sectorielle pour une am\u00e9lioration de la qualit\u00e9 et\n            de l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me : Le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif malien :\n            Analyse sectorielle pour une am\u00e9lioration de la qualit\u00e9 et\n            de l\u00bfeffi cacit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2010/06/13623555/le-syst\u00e8me-\u00e9ducatif-malien-analyse-sectorielle-pour-une-am\u00e9lioration-de-la-qualit\u00e9-de-l\u0092effi-cacit\u00e9-du-syst\u00e8me","projn":"ML-Education Sector Investment Program II -- P093991","subtopic":"Access & Equity in Basic Education,Teaching and Learning,Gender and Education,Education For All,Primary Education","docty":"Working Paper","teratopic":"Education,Gender","count":"Mali","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20110120162004"},"subsc":"General public administration sector,Vocational training,Tertiary education,Secondary education,Primary education","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Le developpement humain en Afrique,Africa education country status report","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Education,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to secondary education,\n            accreditation, achievement, achievement in education, basic\n            education, classrooms, community schools, curriculum,\n            curriculum development, decentralization, education budget,\n            Education for all, education levels, Education Sector,\n            education system, General Secondary Education, higher\n            education, improving access, Indigenous Peoples,\n            institutional framework, job training, leadership, learning,\n            learning environment, learning time, Municipal schools,\n            pedagogy, physical infrastructure, Primary education,\n            primary schooling, promotion of girls, qualified teachers,\n            quality education, school directors, school health, school\n            management, school mapping, School sites, schools, Secondary\n            education, secondary schools, teacher, teacher training,\n            teacher training institutions, technical training, Tertiary\n            education, textbooks, training centers, vocational\n            education, vocational training"}},"owner":"Education -
