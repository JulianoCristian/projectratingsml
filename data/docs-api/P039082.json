The main negative, geophysical impacts are the\n            generation of geomorphic-dynamic processes resulting from\n            the formation of slopes and the instability arising in\n            streams. Negative impacts include loss of vegetal cover\n            resulting from leveling and grading activities, wildlife\n            migration due to loss of natural habitat, noise caused by\n            machinery and blasting work, and deterioration in water\n            quality caused by materials falling into the beds of rivers\n            and streams, which can in extreme cases result in water\n            courses overflowing and causing avalanches. Contractors will\n            deposit waste material generated from stripping,\n            exploration, and general land preparation activities so as\n            to avoid obstructing natural or artificial water courses;\n            the vegetal layer removed from land will be used as planting\n            to protect slopes. Waste disposal areas will be restored by\n            replanting slopes with material stripped from their original\n            areas. To prevent periodic rises in water level caused by\n            the river overflowing its banks, a channel will be built. A\n            forestry reserve will be established to preserve natural\n            vegetation and offset erosion, maintain a wildlife refuge\n            and protect water sources. Water and air quality analyses\n            will be carried out.
