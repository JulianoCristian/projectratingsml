Some lessons learned\n            includes: a well-designed and methodically implemented\n            communications strategy can help build public support for\n            reform. Offering training and job placement services to\n            people leaving the civil service helps to reduce resistance\n            to public sector reform and facilitates the transition to\n            private sector led growth. Having in place a social welfare\n            system that protects the truly needy is essential to\n            facilitate a reduction of the role of the state in the\n            economy. Establishing a good system for monitoring and\n            evaluation helps to keep implementation of reforms on track.\n            Providing technical assistance for design of the reform\n

to support the adjustment and reform strategy of\n            the Government of the Seychelles. The operation involves a\n            single tranche of \u00806.4 million (US$9 million equivalent) and\n            is conceived as a one-time operation supporting structural\n            reforms to put the Seychelles on a sustainable development\n            path. The objective of the operation is to help the\n            Seychelles establish a stable macroeconomic environment and\n            sustainable fiscal framework. This will be achieved through\n            fiscal adjustment underpinned by public administration and\n            civil service reforms and a reduction of the role of the\n            state in commercial activities. The operation also supports\n            establishment of a targeted social safety net. By providing\n            foreign exchange in a timely manner, the operation will\n            directly contribute to stabilization of the economy during a\n            period of global slowdown and will help in building public\n            support for the reform process. The DPL is expected to\n            achieve substantial measurable outcomes during 2009 and 2010\n            and to contribute to the achievement of restoring internal\n            and external balances with the assistance of the\n            international financial institutions and development partners."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Seychelles - Development Policy Loan
