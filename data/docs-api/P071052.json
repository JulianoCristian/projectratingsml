     From 2002 to 2006, Turkey undertook wide -ranging financial,\n            economic, and public sector reforms. As a result, growth\n            accelerated and public finances improved, with public debt\n            in 2006 at 48 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down\n            from 78 percent. Poverty rates declined sharply. Yet,\n            sustained progress was threatened by challenges in reforming\n            public finances, and outdated regulations hindered\n            investments. Unemployment remained high, and the labor\n            market was largely unskilled. The sharp  deterioration in\n            the global economy in 2008 added to these challenges. The\n            first Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development\n            Policy Loan (REGE DPL 1) in 2010 streamlined World Bank\n            support to Turkey at a critical time when unemployment was\n            16 percent and GDP had contracted by 4.7 percent. The second\n            Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy\n            Loan (REGE DPL 2) supports ongoing reforms of public\n            finances, commercial law, and civil procedures. Turkey has\n            reached almost universal health insurance coverage, enrolled\n            more children in pre-school, and dramatically increased\n            vocational training. These ongoing reforms are expected to\n            reduce poverty and inequality in Turkey over the long run."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sustaining growth with jobs and better\n            services in

Sector\n            Development Policy Loan for Turkey supports a sustained\n            medium-term process of legal, institutional, and structural\n            development that promotes growth and improves social\n            conditions. There are four project components. The first\n            component supports the maintenance of the macroeconomic\n            framework which has underpinned Turkey's recovery after\n            the 2001 crisis as well as the ongoing sustained episode of\n            rapid economic growth that began in 2002 and continues to\n            date. The second component focuses on improving the quality\n            of fiscal adjustment by addressing the growing deficits in\n            the social security system through (a) parametric reforms of\n            pensions and (b) structural improvements in the\n            institutional and administrative framework for the provision\n            of social security benefits and social assistance. This\n            component also supports universal access to health services\n            while deploying actions to increase the efficiency and\n            contain the cost of health services funded by the state.\n            The third component supports continued implementation and\n            broadening of the structural and institutional reforms of\n            the public financial management and budget systems that the\n            World Bank began supporting under the Programmatic Financial\n            and Public Sector Adjustment Loan series of loans. The\n            fourth component supports improving the administration and\n            governance of the public sector through actions required to\n            reduce regional disparities, promote decentralization, and\n            combat corruption at all levels of the public sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Programmatic Public Sector\n            Development Policy Loan
