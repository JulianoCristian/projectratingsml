Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) in the telecom sector and in the\n            Romania Telecommunication Reform and Privatization Project,\n            where the frontier of technology is moving at a rapid pace,\n            it is advisable to build a degree of flexibility into\n            project design and supervision to accommodate at least some\n            of the new applications that may become possible during\n            implementation; 2) project design of telecom projects such\n            as the Romania Telecommunication Reform and Privatization\n            Project involving equipment procurement and installation\n            should give more attention to risks in project cost\n            estimation and assessment of bidders for the supply and\n            installation of telecom equipment. Supervision should help\n            ensure that appointed project management consultants are\n            fully utilized; and 3) while it is important for the Bank to\n            focus on technical assistance aspects of telecom projects,\n            such as support for training and for the development of the\n            policy and regulatory frameworks, it is also essential to\n            ascertain potential support for such components from other\n            international financial institutions and agencies to\n            eliminate duplication of resources, as occurred in the\n            Romania Telecommunication Reform and Privatization Project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -

It is\n            reinforced once again that stability of policy, and agency\n            structure contributes to project achievement. Despite a\n            seemingly country policy development structure at appraisal,\n            the subsequent government's different arrangements,\n            were a contributing factor for considerable time and\n            momentum losses. The issue of suitability of new agencies to\n            perform regulatory functions is one of the lessons that, in\n            retrospect, the project should have given equal\n            consideration to the establishment of a new agency - which\n            would work in close collaboration with the technical agency\n            - to perform those functions. It is important to note that a\n            competent spectrum management, and monitoring system is\n            necessary for an expanding, modern telecom sector, since it\n            provided support to the expansion of wireless services,\n            essential during a period of rapid growth in the use of the\n            spectrum. Another reinforcement is the importance of close\n            donor coordination, key to reform progress, ensuring that no\n            duplication of effort occurred, and facilitating provision\n            of timely advice. On the other hand, the availability of\n            grant assistance from the other agencies reduced the\n            utilization of the project's technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania -
