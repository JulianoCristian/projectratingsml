The project objectives were to support the\n            Government's objectives in the sector by providing\n            additional resources for the National Housing Fund's\n            (NHF) lending for lower income housing and by assisting the\n            Government in formulating a framework for housing policy\n            development and an agenda for policy reform in the sector.\n            The Government's broad objectives for program and\n            policy reform are reported as being: (i) to better target\n            public housing assistance to the poor in terms of the needs\n            of the recipients and to minimize the cost of providing the\n            assistance, and (ii) to improve regulation of the sector in\n            order to increase the efficiency with which the market\n            provides housing services to the entire population. To meet\n            these objectives, the project included two components. The\n            first, the investment component, provided support for an\n            ongoing program of targeted lending through the National\n            Housing Fund (NHF), the government's account window for\n            low-income borrowers. The second component involved\n            developing a program of policy and regulatory reform and a\n            capacity for implementing that program and monitoring the\n            results.Both the Bank and the borrower performed well. There\n            are two main lessons emerge from this project's\n            experience. First is the unpredictability of the process of\n            policy-making. Second is that projects emphasizing policy\n            and regulatory reform cannot be evaluated in the same way\n            that investment projects can."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea - Housing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Korea -
