The main objectives\n            of the project were achieved. The sub loan components\n            provided financial assistance to more SSI (Small Scale\n            Industries) units than expected at appraisal and established\n            the basis for developing a sound SSI credit delivery system.\n            Implementation of the technical assistance components were\n            completed on schedule despite start-up delays. However,\n            institution building objectives implicit in the\n            implementation of these components was weak due to problems\n            with some counterpart staff and advisors. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, expanding outlets\n            for SSI financing from a single intermediary to five\n            nationalized commercial banks has improved SSI's access\n            to credit. Second, project-based appraisal methodology\n            should be complemented with traditional procedures of\n            commercial banks. Third, expansion of SSI financing occurred\n            mainly because banks were provided with funds of matching\n            maturities and given sufficient spreads to cover costs.\n            Fourth, it is more efficient to start with a more\n            centralized loan processing system rather than requiring\n            decentralization from the start. Fifth, implementation of\n            technical assistance components is usually much slower than\n            the sub loan component. Lastly, technical assistance\n            components achieved success by focusing on potential\n            clientele, involving private sector associations, and\n            defining specific objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan -
