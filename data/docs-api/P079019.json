Lessons learned from the\n            project: While carrying out studies of this kind, it is\n            important to have a realistic timeframe for reviewing the\n            numerous draft reports; back and forth exchange of views\n            among the consultants, the Bank, and the Borrower; and for\n            incorporating the comments. Regular consultation with the\n            donors, participation of all donor agencies right from the\n            early stages of project preparation, and establishing\n            coordination mechanism are essential for the successful\n            implementation of a project in Kosovo. It is important for\n            the Bank to mobilize the required inter-disciplinary skills.\n            For example, the involvement of the Bank's mining\n            specialists in the project was useful in resolving mining\n            issues and also in developing the framework for private\n            sector participation. In post-conflict situations such as in\n            Kosovo, it is essential to focus more on capacity building,\n            right from the beginning of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo - Second Energy Sector Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo -

There are\n            three project components identified on the basis of the\n            ESTAP-I Energy Sector Study (December, 2002) and discussions\n            with the Government. Component 1 prepares a detailed\n            feasibility report for a 400 kV transmission interconnection\n            between Kosovo and Albania taking into account regional\n            perspective, and developing an approach for commercially\n            sustainable terms of exchange of power with the neighboring\n            systems. The feasibility study will be conducted in\n            coordination with Albania. Component 2 prepares a bankable\n            project for establishment of a dispatch center in Kosovo.\n            Component 3  assists in developing a policy, legal,\n            regulatory, and institutional framework for private\n            investment in the energy sector. The Terms of Reference for\n            Component 3 are currently being developed. The TORS will\n            include, inter alia, a review from the perspective of\n            foreign private investors of issues such as applicable\n            commercial law, business registration,
