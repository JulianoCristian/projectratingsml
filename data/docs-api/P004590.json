Key lessons learned include: 1)\n            Projects with highly politicized agencies such as National\n            Electrification Administration, where the risk is high that\n            even key operational personnel will be changed after general\n            elections, should not be initiated shortly before such\n            elections. Alternatively, commitments should be obtained\n            from the borrower that key personnel will not be changed. 2)\n            At the time of Board presentation, at least the first\n            bidding document should be available. 3) A project\n            implementation unit should be in place at the beginning of a\n            project. The unit should be staffed adequately or the\n            project director should be authorized to assign personnel\n            from other departments for certain tasks. 4) Procurement\n            should be based on a cautious assessment of the capability\n            of the procurement agency. 5) Consultants who reside in the\n            country should not be selected for assistance in\n            procurement. 6) If there are indications that favoritism\n            plays a role, then the Bank should consider getting out of\n            the project at the first sign. 7) Small items such as\n            hardware and tools should not be included in the list of\n            material funded by the Bank projects if they can be\n            purchased locally. 8) The Bank's procurement tasks\n            should be shifted to the resident mission. 9) Time schedules\n            should be based on conservative assumptions regarding the\n            duration of bid evaluation and delivery schedules."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Philippines -
