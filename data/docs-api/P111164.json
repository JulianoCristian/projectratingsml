Ratings for the Second Phase of\n            the 135 Programs Supports Credit Project was as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Ratings for the One-Two Public\n            Investment Reform Project were as follows: outcomes were\n            unsatisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: excessive flexibility regarding the policy\n            content of a programmatic series weakens the program.\n            Although flexibility is an important feature of Bank policy\n            lending, there is room for striking a better balance between\n            flexibility and rigor. Inclusion of partially met triggers\n            as prior actions should be considered with particular\n            caution. Greater willingness on the part of the Bank and\n            other external partners to withdraw their support for weakly\n            implemented reform programs and unproductive policy dialogue\n            can strengthen the content and outcome of future operations.\n            The delays in the second operations of P135 and PIR, and\n            PRSC 10 appear to have reflected concerns with program\n            quality, which, however, were only adequately resolved in\n            the case of P135. Arguments for budget predictability under\n            the Paris Declaration are less relevant in Vietnam due to\n            relatively small share of budget support in public\n            expenditures. A strong knowledge base is of critical\n            importance for upstream design of reforms and parallel\n            technical assistance to support their implementation.\n            Selectivity

Vietnam were as\n            follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the breadth of\n            the reform undertaking and linkages among policy actions\n            across sectors called for a comprehensive approach to\n            dialogue and support by development partners. The strong\n            track record of government commitment and adoption by\n            partners of the PRSC series to match government priorities\n            and processes made this approach work. Analytical work gives\n            insight on inter-linkages across individual policy areas, as\n            well as cross-cutting issues, and helps ensure they are\n            appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported\n            under the operation. Dedicated and adequate resources for\n            analytical work and short-term technical assistance enables\n            the government and development partners to assess the\n            potential impacts of related policy actions and help refine\n            the proposals. Donor coordination can strengthen the policy\n            dialogue and deliver benefits to the client. The PRSC series\n            served as an effective framework for policy dialogue and\n            interactions between the government and donors. Government\n            line ministries voiced concern that financial flows from the\n            PRSCs went directly into the state budget, and their\n            participation in the often time-intensive policy dialogue\n            did not result in direct budgetary increases. Multi-sectoral\n            Development Policy Lending\u0092s (DPLs) may be best suited to\n            ministries that have clear and strong policy linkages, and\n            where improved policy coordination is a primary objective.\n            There is a need to complement consideration of outcome\n            indicators by looking at qualitative assessments of\n            achievements and also at complementary objectives."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - A Series of Five Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - A Series of

           Credit (PRSC 8) Program for Vietnam is designed to assist\n            the government to implement its Socio-Economic Development\n            Plan (SEDP) 2006-2010.' It aims to support all four\n            pillars of the SEDP, namely, fostering business development,\n            ensuring social inclusion, managing natural resources, and\n            strengthening governance. The credit is the third in a\n            programmatic series of five annual single-tranche operations\n            (PRSCs 6-10). This series follows the first cycle of five\n            operations (PRSCs 1-5). The PRSCs are well-suited to support\n            the implementation of the SEDP, as the cross-cutting nature\n            of the policy dialogue conducted through PRSCs encourages\n            taking a holistic view of the reform agenda, and promotes\n            collaboration among line ministries and government agencies.\n            The annual programming is demanding, but provides the\n            government with predictability for planning purposes, and\n            also helps keep the reform momentum. The PRSCs are designed\n            to be forward-looking. The negotiation of each PRSC\n            operation includes reaching an agreement on a list of policy\n            measures that will, in principle, be supported by the\n            following operation. These policy measures, or\n            'triggers,' are grounded in the SEDP 2006-2010 as\n            well as other key documents and strategies, and are\n            considered to have strategic importance to attain the SEDP\n            objectives. Triggers are very limited in number. They are\n            not conditions but rather a framework to guide the policy\n            dialogue in the subsequent operation. It is understood that\n            some triggers may not be fully met while others may be\n            exceeded. In addition to the 'triggers,' the\n            policy dialogue conducted under PRSCs addresses a broader\n            set of issues, articulated as 'benchmarks.' These\n            benchmarks are reported to convey the scope of the reforms\n            being implemented. They are not part of the legal agreement,\n            although they strengthen the implementation of the SEDP. The\n            relatively large number of benchmarks is justified by the\n            committed participation in the PRSC process of close to two\n            dozen government ministries and agencies and more than a\n            dozen donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Eighth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Eighth
