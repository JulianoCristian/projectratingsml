Some of the key lessons learned\n            from the project include: (1) Human capacity development is\n            as important as technical training in projects promoting\n            rural decentralized infrastructure service delivery. In the\n            RTIP, while physical targets were met or exceeded, more\n            effective and in-depth training may have helped to smooth\n            project implementation and to build longer term capacity\n            within the Government, including for environmental\n            management. A decision to rely on a parallel Bank financed\n            project for planned training did not generate the results\n            anticipated, as confirmed by IEG\u2019s review of both this and\n            the parallel project. Training in the parallel project was\n            found to have been inadequate. (2) Civil works contracts\n            should include a transparently negotiated, price escalation\n            provision, even during short implementation periods, but\n            ensuring a more realistic estimate would be important, too.\n            In the case of RTIP, the price of construction materials\n            rose sharply during the short implementation period\n            (eighteen months) which resulted in many contractors\n            abandoning the works. (3) Timing and sequencing are critical\n            considerations when awarding civil works contracts. In the\n            case of RTIP, the implementing agency awarded civil works\n            contracts at the beginning of the rainy season or late in\n            the dry season, resulting in non-activity of contractors for\n            half of the year and delays in contract implementation. All\n            contracts which were awarded in this way took an extra year\n            for completion. On the other hand, contracts awarded at the\n            end of rainy season had two full dry seasons to be completed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Phase one of Rural Transport\n            Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bangladesh - Phase one of Rural\n            Transport Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2016/06/26582407/bangladesh-phase-one-rural-transport-improvement-project","topic":"Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Rural Roads m1327606 786,Rural Transport m1327164 789","projn":"BD-Rural Transport Improvement Project -- P071435","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Bangladesh","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"090224b08446f97b_1_0"},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Agricultural markets, commercialization and agri-business,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads","theme":"Rural markets,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964,Rural Roads m1327606 786,Rural Transport m1327164 789","sectr":"Transportation,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","owner":"Transport & ICT - GP (GTIDR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"106729"},"17418909":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/02/17418909/bangladesh-rural-transport-improvement-project-rtip","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2013/02/17418909/bangladesh-rural-transport-improvement-project-rtip","new_url":"2013/02/17418909/bangladesh-rural-transport-improvement-project-rtip","disclosure_date":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/03/07/000442464_20130307102650/Rendered/INDEX/ICR248000PUBLIC0.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/03/07/000442464_20130307102650/Rendered/PDF/ICR248000PUBLIC0.pdf","credit_no":"3791","docdt":"2013-02-27T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2013-03-07T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Rural Transport Improvement\n            Project (RTIP)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Rural Transport\n            Improvement Project for Bangladesh were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: the implementation of road works\n            was often delayed due to the resolution of the land\n            acquisition and resettlement (LA and R) actions but the road\n            sections which did not involve any LA and R actions, were\n            implemented as planned. The land acquisition should\n            therefore be minimized to the extent possible; all actions\n            including compensation to the affected persons should be\n            completed prior to awarding civil work contracts (with\n            relevant legal covenants). Many contractors were forced to\n            abandon the works and about 70 contracts were cancelled and\n            then re-awarded. To ensure contractors do not renege on\n            their contractual obligations, the executing agency should\n            put reasonable fixed amount against this bill of quantities\n            (BOQ) item. On many occasions local government engineering\n            department (LGED) awarded civil works contracts at the\n            beginning of rainy season or late in the dry season,\n            resulting in non-activity of contractors for half of the\n            year and delays in contract implementation. All contracts\n            which were awarded in this pattern took one year extra for\n            completion. This did not impact maintenance contracts but\n            only improvement works. On the other hand contracts awarded\n            by the end of rainy season had two full dry seasons to be\n            completed. The procurement of key technical assistance (TA)\n            and consultancy services should be completed by project\n            launch to avoid lengthy deferrals in implementation with\n            gradually reduced counterparts concern and drive. Where\n            piloting of important new concepts, processes and approaches\n            is planned, there should be a provision for rapid transition\n            from pilot to mainstreaming within the term of the same\n            project rather than plan an up-take of the post-pilot\n            activity in the new project with risk of loss of momentum."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
