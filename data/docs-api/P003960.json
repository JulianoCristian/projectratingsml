Key\n            lessons learned are essentially the same as those drawn from\n            the overlapping Gas Distribution Project (see report number\n            13889): Long-term technical collaboration (twinning) of the\n            state gas corporation (PNG) with an experienced operating\n            entity was successful in institutional development and\n            technology transfer, providing a broad-based package of\n            technical assistance, integrated know-how transfer, and\n            staff training. Gas supplies must be assured before a\n            commitment with customers is firmed up. Gas marketing should\n            lead infrastructure investment in order to minimize idle\n            investment, avoid reducing the company's bargaining\n            position vis-a-vis customers, and maintain its profit\n            margin. Integrating gas supply and the reticulation system\n            maximizes economic gains by balancing supply and demand, and\n            minimizing investment and operating cost. Outsourcing\n            project implementation activities enables implementation of\n            expansion projects and minimizes employee establishment\n            costs. An appropriate legal and regulatory framework should\n            be in place to ensure compliance with agreements and\n            efficient development of the gas chain from production to\n            utilization.
