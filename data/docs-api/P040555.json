Some important\n            project lessons learned were: (1) Flexible, responsive\n            project design. The flexibility in project design allowed\n            for timely adjustments in the agreed implementation\n            strategy, as the country's needs and priorities\n            evolved. (2) Staff continuity at project implementation\n            unit. Continuity of staff is a critical element of project\n            success or failure. (3) Project implementation in a rapidly\n            changing political and sector environment and need for\n            realistic assessment of project progress. Difficulties in\n            project implementation must be resolved and issues should be\n            proactively addressed. (4) Importance of strong government\n            commitment, particularly with reform-oriented projects.\n            Reform is concerned not only with technical and\n            institutional improvements, but relies heavily on political\n            processes. (5) Need for effective coordination between all\n            major partners. Management and supervision of projects and\n            programs where many partners are involved should be a joint\n            exercise during the total span of the project. (6)\n            Continuous guidance of and active engagement with\n            counterparts, provision of technical and timely support for\n            fiduciary tasks, and strong local
