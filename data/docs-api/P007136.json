The main lessons learned with this project\n            can be summarized as follows: Although modernization calls\n            for an integrated approach so that all impediments to\n            efficient performance of the public sector can be dealt with\n            simultaneously, a \"Christmas-tree\" approach to\n            modernization should not be pursued. Although this project\n            succeeded in achieving its development objectives, in\n            countries with political instability projects with a limited\n            focus and short duration would be more appropriate.\n            Political support at the highest level is crucial to enforce\n            the utilization of financial management systems by all\n            public sector agencies. Political commitment is\n            indispensable not only to carry the implementation of a\n            system but also to lead the enactment of necessary legal and\n            regulatory improvements. The in-house development of a\n            system for financial management would allow improvement of\n            local expertise and increase the possibility of meeting\n            national needs and priorities. The provision to and\n            accessibility of public sector financial information by\n            civil society and the public at large will contribute to the\n            attainment of transparency, improvement in governance, and\n            control of corruption."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Modernization of the State\n            Technical Assistance
