A handy\n            portmanteau definition of watershed development is as\n            follows: a watershed may be defined as a geographic area\n            that drains to a common point. Integrated watershed\n            development is generally understood as an approach that\n            combines soil and water conservation with social and\n            institutional development, in addition to pursuing a broad\n            range of activities that meet the felt needs of communities\n            across many sectors, such as rural access, water supply, and\n            income-generating activities.  Assessing watershed\n            development and forest interventions side-by-side is no idle\n            juxtaposition. Obviously, all forests fall within watersheds\n            so there is some merit to having a natural resources\n            management strategy that includes both.  In designing\n            watershed and forest interventions there is a common theme.\n            Both types of project are beset by problems of property\n            rights that have been incompletely specified or questionably\n            assigned or are simply missing. This report assesses two\n            watershed development projects and one forestry project. The\n            objectives of the watershed development projects in the\n            Shivalik Hills and in Karnataka were similar: both sought to\n            improve the productive potential of

Soil erosion and water\n            drainage will be minimized by reducing gully inflows,\n            through vegetative measures. Treatment of the gully system\n            should start downstream, to slowly progress upstream, while\n            the design of gully control structures should be specific to\n            each work site. Likewise, the site for check-dams shall be\n            site-specific, to include low slope gully checks, and silt\n            basins shall be used for steep slopes, to include silt traps\n            of bench types. Vegetative measures may be combined with\n            possible cut-off drains to prevent rapid overland flow into\n            roadsides, and should as well stabilize erosion on side\n            slopes, along with retaining walls. High soil erosion will\n            be contained through the installation of stone rip-rap or\n            pitching wooden wooden piles. Adequate water catchment areas\n            will be located for water harvesting with eco-engineering\n            devices, but provisions should be made to trap flowing\n            debris and sediment loads located at the inlet for easy\n            access for cleaning purposes. Scour protection should be\n            provided at the overflow spillway base, where a stone\n            pitched channel should conduct excess water from the structure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Final
