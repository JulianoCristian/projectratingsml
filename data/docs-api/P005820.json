Some of the lessons learned from the project\n            are: (i) in hardship areas, the early construction of staff\n            housing and the provision of special allowances are\n            necessary to motivate and attract qualified staff; (ii)\n            extension subject matter specialists (SMSs) should be\n            exposed to new technologies early on while they are being\n            developed or verified by researchers; (iii) success of the\n            technical assistance (TA) components can achieved when,\n            inter alia, a favorable environment for good performance is\n            created; (iv) early training and institutional building\n            helps in the achievement of project objectives; and (v) in\n            retrospect, the Abu Dhabi fund pullout had the unintended\n            benefit of allowing the empowerment of farmers to construct,\n            operate and maintain with Eastern Region Agricultural\n            Development
