Some of the lessons include: a)\n            Multiple Support Service Program to Medium Small and\n            Microenterprises (CIMO) should focus more on guiding\n            enterprises toward productivity issues. b) In order to make\n            enterprises self-sufficient with regard to technical\n            assistance and worker training, CIMO should advise firms on\n            concrete steps they should take to identify and use relevant\n            and effective training programs for continued staff\n            development and technical advice. c) CIMO should continue to\n            cater to smaller enterprises with a real need for the\n            assistance. d) It is important for the CIMO program to\n            introduce specific targets of productive performance that\n            could be easily monitored by the smaller firms, including\n            output per worker, sales and value added. e) It is necessary\n            to include in the Labor Retraining Program (PROBECAT)\n            conceptual frameworks and best practices on how to open and\n            administer a business. f) To encourage self-employment,\n            prospective PROBECAT beneficiaries should be properly\n            screened regarding their socio-demographic, economic, as\n            well as employment history and their post-fellowship\n            motivation and intentions. g) In general, women benefit from\n            and make good use of the PROBECAT training programs if they\n            have economic dependents. h) Young people with higher\n            education should be directed to other employment assistance\n            programs as they tend not to seek self-employment or\n            low-earnings employment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
