The project achieved\n            its lending component objectives satisfactorily with most of\n            its quantitative targets being either achieved or surpassed.\n            Its impact has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and both the Bank and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, effective\n            appraisal procedures, intensive supervision, and enforcement\n            of credit discipline in the repayment of sub loans and the\n            institutionalization of a credit guarantee scheme are\n            important elements in successful project-based lending.\n            Second, measures have to be taken to compel credit\n            discipline among large sub-borrowers, including the\n            requirement and enforcement of partial securities and\n            circulating a list of defaulters to all PCI branches. Third,\n            in the export development component, more time than\n            anticipated was needed to resolve the material supply,\n            product design, and marketing problems limiting export\n            expansion. Lastly, CIDB needs to evolve its approach to\n            training by providing substantial training to trainers to\n            enable them to upgrade the skills of existing artisans. The\n            upgrading of skills should be based on local sustained\n            demand for consumer products."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Cottage and Small Industries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Cottage and Small\n            Industries Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/04/742139/nepal-cottage-small-industries-project","projn":"NP-Cottage Industries -- P010165","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Industrial Management","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925061838"},"subsc":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise-IL","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,administrative costs,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable land,breakdowns,central\n            bank,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,conditions,Economic Impact,economies of\n            scale,employment,Exports,Financial Performance,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,fixed costs,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,Handicrafts,imports,Industrial\n            Development,industrial investment,industrial\n            investments,industrial policies,industrial\n            production,industrial products,Industrial Sector,Industrial\n            Services,inflation,inflation rate,interest rate,interest\n            rates,legislative framework,LENDING RATES,licensing,natural\n            resource base,portfolios,production\n            planning,productivity,public enterprises,public\n            services,purchasing power,service industries,small\n            industry,Technical Assistance,transport,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,administrative costs,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,arable land,breakdowns,central\n            bank,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,conditions,Economic Impact,economies of\n            scale,employment,Exports,Financial Performance,financial\n            resources,FISCAL YEAR,fixed costs,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,Handicrafts,imports,Industrial\n            Development,industrial investment,industrial\n            investments,industrial policies,industrial\n            production,industrial products,Industrial Sector,Industrial\n            Services,inflation,inflation rate,interest rate,interest\n            rates,legislative framework,LENDING RATES,licensing,natural\n            resource base,portfolios,production\n            planning,productivity,public enterprises,public\n            services,purchasing power,service industries,small\n            industry,Technical Assistance,transport,working capital"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"7710"},"723326":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1981/11/723326/nepal-cottage-small-industries-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1981/11/723326/nepal-cottage-small-industries-project","new_url":"1981/11/723326/nepal-cottage-small-industries-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/10/000178830_9810190238281/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/11/10/000178830_9810190238281/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1191","datestored":"2000-11-10T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1981-11-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Cottage and Small Industries Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project aims to generate employment,\n            raise incomes and increase foreign exchange earnings through\n            expanded production and exports of cottage and small\n            industry products.

Each component\n            includes a strong monitoring and evaluation system, which\n            should facilitate response and corrective action in the face\n            of unforeseen difficulties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Cottage and Small Industries Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Cottage and Small\n            Industries Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/10/726184/nepal-cottage-small-industries-project","projn":"NP-Cottage Industries -- P010165","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Access to Markets,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912515022"},"subsc":"(Historic)Small scale enterprise-IL","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,arable land,balance of payments,Bank\n            Branches,bank lending,banking system,barter,central\n            bank,commerce,commercial agents,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitive price,cost\n            increases,deposits,developed countries,development\n            projects,domestic market,economic situation,economies of\n            scale,Employment,exchange rate,export\n            markets,exports,feasibility studies,financial\n            sector,finished products,Food production,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,imports,income,industrial\n            sector,inflation,inflation rate,Interest Rate,Interest\n            Rates,International Trade,labor costs,lending rates,market\n            information,market penetration,market potential,Market\n            surveys,marketing,natural resources,oil,per capita\n            incomes,policy environment,population growth,population\n            pressures,price increases,pricing policies,producers,product\n            quality,production costs,productivity,profitability,public\n            agencies,public enterprises,purchasing,purchasing\n            power,rebates,retail,Sales,stocks,substitutes,substitution,Technical\n            Assistance,trade balance,trade\n            deficit,transport,Valuation,value added,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,ADB,agricultural\n            production,Agriculture,arable land,balance of payments,Bank\n            Branches,bank lending,banking system,barter,central\n            bank,commerce,commercial agents,commercial banks,comparative\n            advantage,competitive price,cost\n            increases,deposits,developed countries,development\n            projects,domestic market,economic situation,economies of\n            scale,Employment,exchange rate,export\n            markets,exports,feasibility studies,financial\n            sector,finished products,Food production,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GDP,imports,income,industrial\n            sector,inflation,inflation rate,Interest Rate,Interest\n            Rates,International Trade,labor costs,lending rates,market\n            information,market penetration,market potential,Market\n            surveys,marketing,natural resources,oil,per capita\n            incomes,policy environment,population growth,population\n            pressures,price increases,pricing policies,producers,product\n            quality,production costs,productivity,profitability,public\n            agencies,public enterprises,purchasing,purchasing\n            power,rebates,retail,Sales,stocks,substitutes,substitution,Technical\n            Assistance,trade balance,trade\n            deficit,transport,Valuation,value added,wages"}},"owner":"Finance & PSD Unit (SASFP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"3172"},"facets":{}}}
