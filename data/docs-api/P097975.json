Multi-Sector\n            Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project for Guinea-Bissau were\n            as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory, the\n            risk to development outcome was substantial, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project was initially designed to have\n            participation of the private sector in the energy and water\n            sectors. However, during implementation it was clear that\n            the willingness of the private sector to get involved in a\n            volatile political environment was overestimated. While\n            private sector investments are needed in fragile states, a\n            realistic analysis of the willingness of the private sector\n            to get involved in such a context should be conducted.\n            Multisectoral projects, especially of a small size, are\n            challenging and expensive to supervise. In the case of MIRP,\n            it was mapped to the energy unit and as such, the unit took\n            leadership in its supervision. This led to an imbalance in\n            supervision, with water and transport specialists less\n            actively involved in Project supervision. This was a missed\n            opportunity to provide much needed advice and support to the\n            country in those areas and improve implementation\n            (especially in the transport sector before the\n            restructuring). Internal Bank incentives for cross-sectoral\n            collaboration have since evolved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau - Multi-Sector Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation
