The lessons learned indicate that The\n            evaluation of the PPIP pointed out the importance of\n            involving beneficiaries and their organizations (e.g.,\n            professional associations, producers' organizations,\n            etc.) from the initial planning stages onward, and of giving\n            them some responsibility for implementation. Despite the\n            limited results of the project in disseminating technology\n            and technical irrigation practices, some testing and\n            demonstration results that interested several hundred\n            producers deserve to be pursued, i.e simplified drip\n            irrigation technology for fruit trees, use of high\n            performing varieties and technical packages for market\n            garden products in the warm season. The Bank supported\n            projects in Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso to develop small\n            private irrigation; each of these projects yielded a better\n            understanding of the sector and insights into possible\n            solutions for specific problems at a regional level. Any\n            development project, and especially those dealing with\n            producers' organizations, should be based upon a\n            simple, clear and coherent design, validated hypotheses, a\n            limited number of components, well-identified (and\n            described) target beneficiaries, a validated\n            monitoring/evaluation framework, and realistic performance\n            indicators. Fiduciary matters are critical and are the\n            source of many project implementation problems. It is\n            essential that the systems be put in place, as well as the\n            initial disbursement requests, be closely monitored, and\n            that supervision missions be carefully synchronized so that\n            all experts are present, including financial management and\n            procurement specialists. Projects aimed at strengthening the\n            private sector should be managed according to private sector\n            procedures. Measures pertaining to the management of public\n            procurement should be simplified, without compromising sound\n            financial management. Managerial staff for these\n            'public/private partnership' projects should be\n            recruited primarily from the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Pilot Private Irrigation Promotion Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - Pilot Private Irrigation\n            Promotion Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/01/2946706/mali-pilot-private-irrigation-promotion-project","projn":"ML-Mali:Irrig Promotion -- P001738","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research,Health Economics & Finance,ICT Policy and Strategies,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Mali","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040213101148"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Law and justice,Irrigation and drainage,General finance sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to credit,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            products,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,average\n            yields,collaboration,crop varieties,cropping,cropping\n            seasons,crops,data collection,decentralization,development\n            projects,diseases,drainage,economic conditions,economic\n            development,Economics,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,FAO,farmers,farms,feasibility studies,financial\n            management,Financial Sector,Fisheries,food\n            products,income,incomes,Irrigation,labor\n            costs,learning,Livestock,maize,market\n            prices,marketing,National Agricultural Research,natural\n            resource management,new technologies,NGOs,poverty\n            reduction,private sector,Producers,production\n            techniques,productivity,programs,public services,rice,Rural\n            Development,rural infrastructure,soils,Structural\n            Adjustment,Supply Chains,taxation,technical\n            supervision,technicians,training activities,United\n            Nations,urban areas,willingness to pay"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to credit,agricultural\n            development,Agricultural Extension,agricultural\n            products,Agricultural Research,Agriculture,average\n            yields,collaboration,crop varieties,cropping,cropping\n            seasons,crops,data collection,decentralization,development\n            projects,diseases,drainage,economic conditions,economic\n            development,Economics,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,equipment,Exchange\n            Rate,FAO,farmers,farms,feasibility studies,financial\n            management,Financial Sector,Fisheries,food\n            products,income,incomes,Irrigation,labor\n            costs,learning,Livestock,maize,market\n            prices,marketing,National Agricultural Research,natural\n            resource management,new technologies,NGOs,poverty\n            reduction,private sector,Producers,production\n            techniques,productivity,programs,public services,rice,Rural\n            Development,rural infrastructure,soils,Structural\n            Adjustment,Supply Chains,taxation,technical\n            supervision,technicians,training activities,United\n            Nations,urban areas,willingness to pay"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 4 (AFTS4)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020460-NORWEGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF023655-REG.
