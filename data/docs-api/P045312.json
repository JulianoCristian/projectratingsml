There were 4 significant lessons learned\n            from this project: 1. Contributions from other donors should\n            not be reflected in the project costing and activities\n            schedule unless firm commitments have been obtained. In the\n            absence of this, explicit arrangements should be included in\n            the Credit financing and covenants to ensure that these\n            activities can be continued if the donor financing does not\n            materialize. If the donor funds are made available, the\n            concomitant Credit funds can either be cancelled or\n            reallocated to other activities. 2. Where Borrower\n            commitment to various project activities appears uneven,\n            strategies should be developed to ensure that the\n            implementing activities seen as lower priority by the\n            Borrower is not adversely affected if problems occur in\n            other activities considered higher priority. Further, teams\n            should carefully consider the extent to which social sector\n            projects which aim to support substantial sectoral\n            restructuring should also include large infrastructure\n            investments. 3. Monitoring and evaluation indicators should\n            include key benchmarks and decision points, especially where\n            activities require substantial implementation time. The time\n            schedules for lengthy implementation activities should be\n            carefully constructed, allowing an appropriate length of\n            time for each step of the process, and also reflecting the\n            experience and expertise of the implementation agency. 4.\n            Small punctuated technical assistance interventions (such as\n            those introduced during the mid-term review) achieve little,\n            as they fail to substantially engage counterparts, do not\n            build up a longer-term relationship of mutual trust, and do\n            not result in the TA activity becoming an integral part of\n            the implementing agency's work program. A more\n            comprehensive, coherent and longer-term technical assistance\n            program is usually necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Health System Recovery and\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Health System Recovery\n            and Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6030612/albania-health-system-recovery-development-project","projn":"AL-Health Recovery Project -- P045312","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050628092002"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Health","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility, adaptation, anxiety,\n            Assessment Study, broad consensus, capacity building,\n            communicable diseases, competencies, Currency Unit,\n            decentralization, development strategy, East Europe,\n            Exchange Rate, expenditures, extension, financial\n            management, health centers, health centres, health\n            financing, Health Insurance, health interventions, Health\n            Planning, Health Policy, Health Promotion, health sector,\n            health service, health services, Health status, HEALTH\n            SYSTEM, Health System Management, Health system performance,\n            health systems, Hospital Administration, hospital\n            management, hospitals, Human Development, Human Development\n            Sector Unit, human resource capacities, Immunodeficiency,\n            impact assessment, Implementation Plan, implementing agency,\n            infectious diseases, Injuries, Institutional Development,\n            international consultant, laboratories, life expectancy,\n            management capacity, managers, medical equipment, mortality,\n            Poverty Reduction, Poverty Reduction Strategy, primary care,\n            Primary Health Care, public education, Public Health, public\n            sector, quality of health care, quantitative research,\n            recurrent costs, recurrent expenditures, refugees,\n            rehabilitation, rural areas, service delivery, service\n            providers, service provision, Supervision, Sustainability,\n            sustainable health care, Task Team Leader, task team\n            leaders, Technical Assistance, TTL, vandalism, Waste"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF030365-SWEDEN CTF FY03 - GENERAL,TF030452-ITALIAN CTF (EE) FY04 - ECA\n            (ALBANIA, AZERBAIJAN, BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA, B,TF034360-ALBANIA - HEALTH SYSTEM\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,TF038181-ALBANIA: HEALTH SYS.
