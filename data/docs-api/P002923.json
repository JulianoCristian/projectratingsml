Both\n            World Bank and Borrower performances are adjudged\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned included the following:\n            Experience from the project shows that outsourcing design\n            and supervision to a unit staffed by professionals or\n            consultants, and centralizing the planning and financing,\n            can ensure project readiness for implementation, and reduce\n            the time lag between project design and implementation.\n            Also, this approach enhances cost-effectiveness. A number of\n            constraints remain to be addressed if the local contracting\n            industry is to be sustained, and they include the\n            incompatibility of fixed rate contracts in a fluctuating\n            macroeconomic environment, the review of bidding\n            requirements, the long time lag between tendering and\n            awarding of contract which may require changes in the nature\n            of maintenance works, and the elimination of risks due to\n            uncertainty of payments for works performed. Long-term\n            partnership of the donor community with the Government is\n            critical to the sustainable development of the transport\n            sector in Uganda. The implementation experience from this\n            project has highlighted the need and urgency of\n            institutional reforms if investments in the road sector are\n            to provide the expected impact. The consolidation of\n            institutional reforms would be a major task of follow-on\n            projects, if the absorptive capacity of the transport sector\n            is to be significantly improved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Transport Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Transport Rehabilitation
