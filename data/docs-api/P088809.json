This project highlights the\n            trade-off between having clarity of purpose and allowing\n            sufficient flexibility to cope with rapidly changing\n            circumstances. Being realistic about the time required to\n            implement technical assistance-related projects might render\n            better results.

and overall\n            management capacity of subnational governments. At the same\n            time, it strengthens the capacity of the national government\n            to monitor and evaluate fiscal and financial performance in\n            accordance with the ceilings and targets already established\n            in legislation; (ii) to support the initial steps towards\n            incentives for and evaluation of quality of expenditure at\n            subnational levels, and (iii) to provide technical\n            assistance to reduce transaction costs, enhance operational\n            efficiency and mobilize idle resources at subnational\n            levels. The project has the following five components:\n            Component 1) will focus on providing the tools needed to\n            support the Government of Peru's (GOP's) guiding\n            principle of a fiscally neutral decentralization process and\n            to manage any possible deviations from its medium-term\n            goals. Component 2) will support the government's move\n            toward greater performance orientation. It will support the\n            goal of gradually constructing the basis for programmatic\n            and multiannual budgeting, result indicators, and\n            result-informed fiscal budget and financial medium-term\n            indicators. Component 3) will build on existing systems and\n            processes for public investment planning and public assets\n            management and aims to upgrade them to meet the demands that\n            decentralization has triggered. Component 4) will support\n            government efforts to expand the coverage of its financial\n            management system and upgrade it to provide tools for\n            performance monitoring. Specifically, this fourth component\n            will be geared to support: (i) expeditious adoption of\n            Integrated Financial System (SIAF) by local governments,\n            (ii) the creation of a SIAF debt module, and (iii) virtual\n            registering of the national and regional governments'\n            payroll control system in SIAF. Component 5) will support\n            project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. It will\n            also provide assistance in the area of communication strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Institutional Capacity for\n            Sustainable Fiscal Decentralization Technical
