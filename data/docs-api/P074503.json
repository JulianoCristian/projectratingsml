Lessons learned include: despite\n            changes of ministers, continuity and commitment of senior\n            level ministry officials during the project's life are\n            the key to the smooth project implementation, and therefore\n            to the overall project success. Achieving public consensus\n            on reform issues by sharing with the public the work\n            accomplished and conducting open discussions on issues\n            affecting beneficiaries are essential for building ownership\n            and commitment to reforms and developing the culture of\n            accountability. Good analytical work to inform project\n            design, competent technical assistance as well as envisaging\n            adequate time for the education system to accept changes and\n            innovations (and for preparing it to the changes) at the\n            initial stage are crucial when fundamental reforms are\n            expected. Providing continuous guidance in the context of an\n            ambitious reform agenda is essential. International\n            Development Association (IDA) supervision must be continuous\n            and intensive.

The\n            key indicator will be that 70 percent of teachers are\n            engaged in activities likely to develop the necessary\n            knowledge and competencies in their students. The project\n            has the following five components: Component 1) will provide\n            a more relevant and inclusive general education curriculum\n            and a system for evaluating system performance. Component 2)\n            will help to ensure that schools in Armenia have facilities\n            and capacity to integrate a variety of educational\n            technologies as part of teaching and learning. It will:\n            build the necessary infrastructure for integration of ICT\n            into general education; and, help teachers and students to\n            apply modern teaching and learning methods in schools using\n            ICT and related instructional materials. Component 3) will\n            enable teachers to understand and implement the new\n            curriculum and assessment techniques in the classroom. It\n            will: (i) train teachers in aligning their teaching to the\n            requirements of the new national curriculum and assessment\n            system; (ii) promote the use of active and skills-based\n            teaching methods in schools; (iii) prepare teams of teacher\n            trainers who will be able to serve as teacher development\n            experts in the activities financed by this project and\n            beyond; and (iv) pilot the idea of school-based professional\n            development of teachers, and increase cooperation and\n            experience-sharing among teachers and schools. Component 4)\n            will help to improve the management and efficiency of the\n            education system. The main costs of this component are to\n            provide a package of benefits to the approximately 15,000\n            teachers who are made redundant as a result of\n            rationalization. Benefits could include counseling,\n            training, business services, and additional redundancy\n            payments. Component 5) will provide the necessary assistance\n            for project coordination, financial management, procurement,\n            monitoring and reporting. It will support the investment and\n            operating costs associated with the project management unit,\n            Center for Education Projects (CEP)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Education Quality and Relevance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia -
