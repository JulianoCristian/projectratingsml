Some lessons learned included: country\n            ownership ensures achievement of development objectives,\n            particularly in fragile countries where government\n            leadership is lacking. The involvement of national\n            non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in providing technical\n            assistance and on the-job training to producer groups\n            increases the likelihood of continued capacity building and\n            guarantees that new development management skills stay in\n            the communities that need those most. Capacity constraints\n            in fragile countries are persistent; they often negatively\n            affect results and must be properly mitigated during design\n            - not just implementation. The new global food crisis\n            response program (GFRP) project, currently being formulated,\n            has taken under advisement the lessons related to persistent\n            weak capacity and will rely heavily on world food program\n            (WFP) for implementation, monitoring and evaluation (M and\n            E), and fiduciary management.

The closing date of the project will be\n            extended from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.

The extension of the closing date is\n            necessary for the following reasons: First, there has been\n            some delay in the procurement of critical goods (e.g. rice\n            mills, millet mills and power tillers) since the borrower\n            had to procure these goods from European and/or Asian\n            countries. Second, the borrower requires additional time\n            since some of the equipment needs to be tested on arrival\n            and delivered to the beneficiaries, who, in turn, need to be\n            trained in the efficient and safe use of the equipment which\n            will take additional time. Furthermore, the closing date\n            needs to be extended in order to allow adequate time for the\n            completion of all project activities to assist farmers\n            involved in rice production."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea-Bissau - Emergency Food\n            Security Support Project : restructuring  (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/03/16330397/guinea-bissau-emergency-food-security-support-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"GW-Guinea Bissau--Food Price Crisis Response\n            Program -- P113468","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Food Security,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Food & Beverage Industry,Regional Economic Development","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Agriculture","count":"Guinea-Bissau","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20120605004741"},"theme":"Global food crisis response","subsc":"Crops,Public administration- Agriculture, fishing\n            and forestry,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Industry,Agriculture","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to food, agricultural inputs,\n            agricultural season, Agriculture, direct beneficiaries,\n            equipment, extension, farmer, farming communities, feed,\n            feeder roads, fertilizers, financial management, Food\n            Crisis, food for work, Food Price, Food Production, Food\n            Security, food supply, market towns, meal, pesticides,\n            Pests, Regional Vice President, rice, rice production, Rural\n            Development, safeguard policies, Safeguards, school\n            attendance, smallholder farmers, WFP, World Food Program"}},"owner":"Agric., RD & Irrigt'n Prac 1 (AFTA1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF092979-GUINEA-BISSAU - EMERGENCY FOOD\n            SECURITY SUPPORT PROJECT,TF092980-GUINEA-BISSAU - EMERGENCY FOOD\n            SECURITY SUPPORT PROJECT","majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"67615"},"facets":{}}}
