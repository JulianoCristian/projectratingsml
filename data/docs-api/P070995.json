Some lessons\n            learned included: participatory process promoted by the CDP\n            was critical to achieving a high ownership for project\n            activities. The large participation of the community in the\n            various stages of the sub-project cycle empowered the\n            communities. It gave the feeling that citizens, as end\n            beneficiaries, own the investments and their results. It\n            also made them aware of the rights and responsibilities they\n            have, and gave confidence that they are capable to manage\n            their own development. Significant local co-financing\n            requirements were conducive to better sustainability of\n            implemented sub-projects. Although a certain degree of\n            skepticism regarding the affordability of complying with\n            high co-financing requirements was observed during the\n            project preparation phase, in practice, in spite of the\n            poverty widely spread among the members of the participating\n            communities, their willingness to contribute to the proposed\n            investments was quite high. Their contribution promoted a\n            sense of being real shareholders thus providing an incentive\n            to protect and properly maintain their own investments,\n            ensuring thus sustainability. Flexibility in project\n            implementation was essential to the success of the CDP. The\n            wide variation of local conditions and needs required a\n            degree of flexibility, both in the identification and\n            implementation phases. Several atypical sub-projects\n            (outside of initially envisaged typology) were identified\n            and implemented, with positive unforeseen results. For\n            example the installation of a radio power transmitter (in\n            Pale/Praca) allowed: (i) access to various communications\n            channels for both public services (civil protection, police,\n            health) and individual community members, and (ii) access to\n            internet services and establishment of a local radio station\n            that broadcasts news about the local events, as well as\n            entertainment programs that can be accessed via internet by\n            the Bosnians in diasporas, keeping thus them informed on\n            what is happening in the home land. Also, the flexibility\n            related to the local co-financing requirements enabled\n            eligibility for several sub-projects identified in extremely\n            poor areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Community\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -\n            Community Development
