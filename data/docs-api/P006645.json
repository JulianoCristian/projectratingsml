The Pehuenche Hydroelectric\n            Project, to be executed over a seven-year period, will\n            include (i) the construction of the 500 MW Pehuenche\n            Hydroelectric Power Plant; (ii) a training program for the\n            professional staff of Empresa Electrica Pehuenche S.A.\n            (PEHUENCHE S.A.); and (iii) the execution of a national\n            environmental program. In addition, the Government will\n            undertake executing studies and implementing recommendations\n            on protection of the environment, design of medium size\n            hydroelectric projects and reduction of illicit use of\n            electricity. The Alto Jahuel-Polpaico Transmission project,\n            also to be executed over a seven-year period, will include\n            (i) the construction of 80 km of transmission lines and four\n            substations; and (ii) a training program for the\n            professional staff of Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Pehuenche Hydroelectric and Alto\n            Jahuel - Polpaico Transmission Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile - Pehuenche Hydroelectric\n
