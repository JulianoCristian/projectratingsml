Overall sustainability is assessed as likely\n            for those project components rated as satisfactory. Overall\n            World Bank performance was satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance overall is considered marginally unsatisfactory\n            because the deficiencies in the government's\n            implementation had such a negative effect on the achievement\n            of project objectives. There are three main lessons gleaned\n            from this project experience: 1) The Export Development\n            Support Program needs exceptionally sound administration\n            when provided on a loan basis. 2) Soon after project\n            effectiveness, there was a serious financial sector crisis\n            and then a recession. In these circumstances, it was\n            virtually impossible for the credit line to achieve its goal\n            of increasing term intermediation. Although macroeconomic\n            instability was clearly discussed in the country analysis\n            section of the Staff Appraisal Report, it should have been\n            set out in the report's risk section. Mid-term reviews\n            in particular should carefully review the influence, past\n            and prospective, of the macroeconomic environment on project\n            performance. 3) The ability of a credit line to increase\n            term lending is problematic. Aside from the fact that\n            macroeconomic conditions worsened once again, in retrospect\n            it seems evident that domestic financial institutions would\n            be reluctant to lend on a long-term basis unless they also\n            could obtain funds of a similar tenure."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Private Investment and Export\n            Development

The financial sector support\n            component will enhance the basis for capital markets\n            development and financial intermediation through: (a) a\n            financial sector
