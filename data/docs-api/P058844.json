To meet this development\n            objective, the project will produce the following outputs:\n            reduced traffic and enhanced mobility, improved access to\n            the poor areas in the province, and increased efficiency and\n            effectiveness in public sector management of the road\n            network while preparing the sector for commercialization\n            opportunities.
