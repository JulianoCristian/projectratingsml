Management\n            Support Project (EMSP) for Burundi is to increase the\n            efficiency of Burundi's macroeconomic, financial, and\n            administrative management by strengthening accountability\n            and transparency through improved procedures and controls.\n            When offers had been received in mid 2009, the tenders were\n            well above the budgeted amount in the project. By mail ref.\n            no. 540/3622/2009 dated August 26, 2009, the Minister of\n            Finance, on behalf of the Government confirmed to the World\n            Bank that the gap of financing from approximately US$3.3\n            million will be dealt with in the national budget, 2010 and\n            2011. However, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) had\n            not envisaged the option of co-financing of this activity\n            and had to be amended. At the same time, the construction of\n            the building triggered some of the environmental and social\n            policies of the World Bank. Consequently, a consultant was\n            recruited by the Government in order to help update the plan\n            of environment and safeguard management plan (ESMP) and\n            whose preliminary activities will have had to be carried out\n            before beginning of all work related to the construction of\n            the building. This process took several months and\n            construction finally began in January 2010, with a schedule\n            of 18 months. In addition, there was insufficient quantity\n            of the required quality of cement supplies and bricks\n            available in the local market. There was also higher than\n            usual rain fall causing some delays in construction of the\n            foundation. During the implementation mission in November\n            2010, the World Bank was informed that construction was\n            approximately nine months behind schedule due to extensive\n            delays in getting materials to Bujumbura from Dar-es-Salaam\n            port. The new completion date is estimated to be March 2012,\n            thus resulting in the attach request by the Minister of\n            Finance on behalf of the Government of Burundi to extend the\n            closing date of the project for one year."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Economic Management\n            Support Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/03/14123777/burundi-economic-management-support-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"BI-Economic Management Support Project -- P078627","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Labor Policies,E-Business,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Burundi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110429001625"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Law and justice","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, action plan, arbitration,\n            Arrears, Bank policies, bidding, Borrower, commerce,\n            commercial court, commercial laws, Custom, Disbursement,\n            equipment, expenditures, financial reports, financial\n            system, Financing Plan, government account, Government\n            accounts, Government arrears, ID, Implementing Agency,\n            installation, institutional framework, Judicial reform,\n            Judiciary, justice, Legal framework, local market,\n            macroeconomic management, media, Minister, national budget,\n            Private sector, Private sector development, privatization,\n            Privatization Law, procurement, procurement process, Public\n            Finance, reduction in time, RESULT, results, salaries,\n            settlement, time period, titles, transparency, Web"}},"owner":"AFT: PREM 2 (AFTP2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"61417"},"14123846":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/03/14123846/burundi-economic-management-support-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2011/03/14123846/burundi-economic-management-support-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","new_url":"2011/03/14123846/burundi-economic-management-support-project-restructuring-vol-1-2-main-report","disclosure_date":"2011-04-28T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/04/29/000333037_20110429001418/Rendered/INDEX/614170PJPR0P071xtension0PAGE0032511.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/04/29/000333037_20110429001418/Rendered/PDF/614170PJPR0P071xtension0PAGE0032511.pdf","credit_no":"3852;Q401","datestored":"2011-04-29T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2011-03-28T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Economic Management Support\n            Project : restructuring"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Economic Management\n            Support Project (EMSP) for Burundi is to increase the\n            efficiency of Burundi's macroeconomic, financial, and\n            administrative management by strengthening accountability\n            and transparency through improved procedures and controls.\n            When offers had been received in mid 2009, the tenders were\n            well above the budgeted amount in the project. By mail ref.\n            no. 540/3622/2009 dated August 26, 2009, the Minister of\n            Finance, on behalf of the Government confirmed to the World\n            Bank that the gap of financing from approximately US$3.3\n            million will be dealt with in the national budget, 2010 and\n            2011. However, the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) had\n            not envisaged the option of co-financing of this activity\n            and had to be amended. At the same time, the construction of\n            the building triggered some of the environmental and social\n            policies of the World Bank. Consequently, a consultant was\n            recruited by the Government in order to help update the plan\n            of environment and safeguard management plan (ESMP) and\n            whose preliminary activities will have had to be carried out\n            before beginning of all work related to the construction of\n            the building. This process took several months and\n            construction finally began in January 2010, with a schedule\n            of 18 months. In addition, there was insufficient quantity\n            of the required quality of cement supplies and bricks\n            available in the local market. There was also higher than\n            usual rain fall causing some delays in construction of the\n            foundation. During the implementation mission in November\n            2010, the World Bank was informed that construction was\n            approximately nine months behind schedule due to extensive\n            delays in getting materials to Bujumbura from Dar-es-Salaam\n            port.
