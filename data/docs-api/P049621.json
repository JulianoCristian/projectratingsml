Ratings for the Bukhara and\n            Samarkand Water Supply Project were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: when designing\n            infrastructure and service provision projects within the\n            context of a regional environmental crisis it is essential\n            to minimize objectives and keep them focused on\n            interventions the borrower will support. In this case,\n            driven by the Aral Sea crisis, the Water Supply, Sanitation\n            and Health Project overly emphasized the need to mitigate a\n            range of ill-defined public health problems when even\n            provision of basic services like potable water supply was in\n            jeopardy. Adoption of community driven development models in\n            a country where the culture of community self-help lacks\n            prominence may require additional capacity-building efforts.\n            The practicality and realism of bringing about institutional\n            strengthening of a developing country\u2019s main utilities\n            through a performance-based management contract needs very\n            careful appraisal. Proper tariff setting and demand\n            management efforts are critical factors that lead to\n            expansion in customer base and increased revenues for the\n            utilities. The Buhkara and Samarkand Water Supply Project\n            managed to increase water metering significantly through\n            various measures, leading to enhanced collection of\n            revenues. However, due to lack of financial autonomy, the\n            utility is experiencing difficulty collecting the arrears\n            from government institutions. This is likely to adversely\n            affect the utilities\u2019 commercial performance if the\n            government does not address the utilities\u2019 autonomy issue soon."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uzbekistan - Water Supply, Sanitation and\n            Health Project; and Bukhara and Samarkand Water Supply Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uzbekistan - Water

Some lessons learned included:\n            the project designs should be sensitive to the borrowing\n            country's institutional capacity. In a low-capacity\n            context, a complex project design with a heavy reform agenda\n            may not be feasible because of the steep learning curve.\n            Despite the reasonable scope of the BSWSP, improving SVK/BVK\n            (Samarkand City VodoKanal/Bukhara City VodoKanal) operations\n            through a performance-based management contract proved\n            infeasible and lacked Borrower buy-in. The projects should\n            be restructured or amended to reflect important changes in\n            implementation. This is especially necessary when a\n            loan's binding legal and credit agreement changes\n            during project implementation, and is needed to prevent the\n            Project from being in a state of legal non-compliance. Task\n            Team Leader (TTL) transitions impact project implementation;\n            if implementation is problem-ridden, due attention should be\n            given to ensuring overlap, smooth handover, and task-team\n            continuity. Despite costs that may seem unjustified to local\n            partners, international consultants provide valuable\n            service, capacity transference, technical astuteness, and\n            better transparency, especially in the context of Low Income\n            Country Under Stress (LICUS) countries like Uzbekistan.\n            Procurement packages should be completed ahead of bidding to\n            avoid substantial variations and delays. Similarly,\n            financial management should be planned ahead of project\n            launch. With the BSWSP, compliance with both procurement and\n            fiduciary management was weak."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uzbekistan - Bukhara and Samarkand Water\n            Supply
