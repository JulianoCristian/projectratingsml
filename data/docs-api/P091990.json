Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) By providing a framework for a\n            policy dialogue not only with individual sector ministries\n            but also with the Government as a whole (including key\n            ministries such as the Ministry of Finance), a development\n            policy lending/loan (DPL) operation provides increased\n            leverage for a number of improvements in each sector which\n            may not have been achieved through specific sectoral\n            programs or projects; 2) a DPL operation with a single\n            tranche disbursement for prior actions and progress\n            indicators for future reforms is sensible only if there is a\n            follow-up operation when the progress indicators are being\n            achieved; and 3) in post conflict countries, it is important\n            to strike the right balance between insisting on solid,\n            immediate reforms and not jeopardizing the fragile

Transitional Support for Economic\n            Recovery Operation Project is a one-tranche operation, the\n            third budget and balance of payments support operation to\n            the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since 2002. The Grant\n            is designed to support key policy measures aiming at: (1) in\n            creasing the impact on the poor o f public spending in key\n            priority areas, education and health; (2) strengthening\n            public expenditure and civil service management; and (3)\n            improving governance in forestry and mining sectors. The\n            project addresses poverty reduction in two important ways at\n            a critical time in the country's transition from\n            post-conflict phase to peaceful elections. First, the Grant\n            directly contributes to maintaining a stable macroeconomic\n            framework conducive to economic growth by helping to bridge\n            the financing gap associated with implementing the\n            Government's Economic Program. Second, reforms which\n            the Grant is designed to support will have positive impacts\n            on poverty reduction. Improved efficiency and transparency\n            in public expenditure management will ensure that the\n            Government's budget priorities are increasingly in line\n            with the priorities defined in the Interim Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy Paper, and result in actual releases of resources\n            to public service providers. In particular, better budget\n            execution of health and education ministries will help\n            improve access by the poor to public services provided by\n            these ministries, by reducing user fees which are currently\n            collected. Strengthening civil service management will help\n            restore motivations for civil servants to provide quality\n            public service on which the poor depends. Finally, improving\n            governance in two of the key productive sectors, forestry\n            and mining, will help the population share the\n            country's natural resources in a more equitable manner\n            and enhance sustainability of policies governing the sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of - Transitional\n            Support for Economic Recovery

The\n            Request for Inspection includes 32 annexes. The Requesters\n            claim that they have been harmed and will be harmed by the\n            forestry sector reform activities supported by the Projects,\n            which includes a plan for zoning the forests and, they fear,\n            the implementation of a new commercial forest concession\n            system. They note that the Project includes the preparation\n            of \"a forest zoning plan,\" for the forests of the\n            Equateur and Orientale Provinces, where they have lived for\n            centuries, even millennia. The Requesters claim that if the\n            zoning of the forests occurs without consulting the\n            indigenous peoples and considering their interests and if\n            new forest concessions are assigned, the International\n            Development Association (the \"Bank\") will be\n            violating indigenous peoples' rights and harming their\n            interests. They claim it will lead to violating their right\n            to occupy their ancestral lands, to maintaining the\n            integrity of their traditional lands, to accessing their\n            traditional lands and existing resources, to managing their\n            forests and resources according to traditional knowledge and\n            practices, and to protecting their cultural and spiritual\n            values. They claim this would then lead to the destruction\n            or loss of their natural living environment and their means\n            of subsistence, impose or force change in their way of life,\n            and cause serious social conflict. The Requesters assert\n            that their grievances result from omissions and failures of\n            the Bank regarding its policies and procedures. The Request\n            has been assigned IPN Request Number RQ05/2."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of - Transitional\n            support for Economic Recovery Credit and Emergency
