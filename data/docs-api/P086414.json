Some lessons learned included: impact of\n            compliance with the negative pledge clause: This process\n            required a careful and lengthy preparation of the security\n            package by Power Grid Corporation of India Limited\n            (POWERGRID) which delayed loan effectiveness by about six\n            months (July 31 to December 15, 2006). It would have been\n            useful to resolve this aspect earlier during preparation so\n            that implementation could proceed according to the planned\n            timeline. This is a broader lesson for the India portfolio.\n            However, the resolution of this issue and experience gained\n            during the approval process resulted in the streamlining of\n            the approval of PSDP IV and V by the World Bank. Using\n            operational and project management experience, POWERGRID has\n            effectively contributed to the success of the project.\n            Moreover, this project has shown that continuous reviews and\n            improvements of POWERGRID's technical implementation,\n            procurement and safeguards systems have elevated the\n            standards to be followed by others. Procurement is a\n            delicate matter and with its overlapping synergies with the\n            technical aspects, it is always a tough and contentious\n            issue. Thus, even though there was a regular communication\n            (both formal and informal) between POWERGRID and the Bank\n            during the entire project period, an additional exchange\n            forum, which could be in the form of regular face-to-face\n            meetings, between the Bank and POWERGRID to discuss such\n            complex matters in even more detail shall help in future engagements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Power System Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Third Power System\n            Development

Expected negative environmental impacts can\n            be mitigated as follows: Avoid affecting natural and\n            socio-cultural resources by carefully selecting routes using\n            techniques/tools like GIS and GPS aerial photography. Obtain\n            prior approval and have forestry department supervise when\n            passing transmission lines through forest and protected\n            areas. Provide construction crews with fuel wood or\n            alternative fuels to minimize fuel collecting. Pay\n            compensation for crop damage or other damage to farmland,\n            and restore on-farm works after construction ends. Reroute\n            telecom circuits, convert overhead telecom circuits into\n            cables, etc. to minimize voltage interference. Maintain\n            adequate clearance between transmission lines and railways,\n            civil aviation, and defense installations. Paint airport\n            towers beyond specified height for easy visibility and place\n            warning lights on top of these towers. Where drainage is\n            affected, train flow and guide it to safe zones. Adopt\n            safety measures to avoid fires due to flashover from lines.\n            Resurface the areas where excavation works are done. Restore\n            surfaces with topsoil. Select dumping areas to for rocky\n            material and use as fill for tower foundations. Plant trees\n            along roads to buffer visual effect. Paint towers to blend\n            into background. Provide sound and vibration dampers, and\n            maintain equipment to reduce noise. Reduce nuisance to\n            nearby properties by using tractors and manual labor.\n            Execute work during light traffic periods. Avoid rainy\n            season, cut and fill slopes, use retaining walls, and sow\n            soil-binding grasses to control erosion. Protect worker\n            health and safety.

India aims to strengthen the transmission system\n            in order to increase reliable power exchanges between the\n            regions and states of India. The Project would support\n            POWERGRID's investment program of system strengthening\n            in the various regions and developing inter-regional\n            transmission links to enhance the power exchange capacities,\n            eventually helping enhance the national power grid. There\n            are two project components. Component A, transmission system\n            strengthening schemes, includes strengthening of the intra\n            and inter-regional transmission systems for greater energy\n            security, system reliability and to enhance inter-regional\n            power exchanges. Technical assistance will be considered for\n            enhancing inter-regional power exchange capacities and\n            building a data base of the system. Component B, completion\n            of balance works of the PSDP-I1 project, finances the\n            completion of some of the investment schemes financed under\n            the Second Power System Development Project (loan 4603-IN,\n            report no. 21609) after its closing date."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Third Power System Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Third Power System\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/12/6500907/india-third-power-system-development-project","projn":"IN-Power System Development Project -Iii -- P086414","subtopic":"Energy and Economic Development,Utilities,Electric Power,Investment and Investment Climate,Energy Technology & Transmission","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","teratopic":"Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"India","authors":{"authr":"R2005-0263/1"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20051228105041"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting, Accounting Standards, ADB,\n            adverse impacts, auditors, benchmarking, Bidding, Bidding\n            Documents, capital expenditures, competition policy,\n            consumers, credit policies, credit risk, debt, economic\n            development, economic growth, effective use, Employment,\n            Environmental, environmental impacts, environmental issues,\n            Exchange Rate, financial covenants, Financial Management,\n            Financial performance, financial risk, foreign exchange,\n            Indigenous Peoples, institutional development, internal cash\n            generation, investment priorities, investment program,\n            management reports, opportunity cost, organizational\n            structure, ownership structure, political economy, poverty\n            alleviation, Producers, public participation, regulatory\n            framework, Return on Equity, ROE, Securities,\n            securitization, Specific Investment Loan, Statement,\n            statements, Technical Assistance"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF055160-DFID TRUST FUND FOR\n            ACCELERATING THE SCALING UP OF WORLD BANK ASSISTAN-","repnb":"31884"},"facets":{}}}
