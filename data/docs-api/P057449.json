Some lessons learned included:  the process of\n            altering the structure and functioning of the public\n            administration to ultimately increase the efficacy,\n            efficiency, and transparency of the state is, by nature, an\n            arduous and long-term process. In this context, it is\n            important to fully capitalize on windows of opportunity for\n            drastic change and to 'keep going' during periods\n            when only incremental and gradual change is feasible. As\n            demonstrated by Argentina's experience since the\n            crisis, public sector modernization can also be tackled\n            gradually, in strategically chosen areas that build upon and\n            scale up early results. This implies an incremental approach\n            that envisages public sector modernization as a series of\n            carefully sequenced and targeted series of steps, seizing\n            windows of opportunity in those areas where government\n            ownership is high. The project's implementation was\n            severely affected by the unstable macroeconomic conditions\n            that prevailed in the late 1990s and eventually resulted in\n            the country's collapse in December 2001. By keeping the\n            operation alive in the aftermath of the crisis, the Bank\n            succeeded in maintaining modernization efforts on the public\n            agenda, although actual progress was initially very slow."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina - State Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Argentina - State Modernization

Government's incremental\n            strategy for strengthening the efficiency, effectiveness,\n            and impact of Argentina's services in selected\n            agencies, and strengthen the management tools of selected\n            public entities. Following the economic crisis in 2002-2003,\n            the new administration has opted for an approach of\n            \"strategic incrementals\" in its efforts to improve\n            governance and public sector performance. This approach is\n            based on the promotion of \"islands of innovation\"\n            that provide replicable examples for the undertaking of\n            effective governance reforms. In this context, the\n            Government and the Bank agreed to a series of Action Plans\n            (for CY2004 and CY2005-2006) in order to implement the State\n            Modernization Project, thus reflecting this new incremental\n            strategy and improve overall project implementation. The\n            proposed amendment would also provide for the introduction\n            of a new component, fully consistent with the revised\n            Project Development Objective of the Loan, which consists of\n            the initiation of the second phase of the Social and Fiscal\n            National Identification System (SINTyS) program, supported\n            under an APL operation the first phase, and successfully\n            implemented under Loan 4459-AR. The proposed amendment\n            complies with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and it\n            is thus recommended to approve amending the loan agreement\n            in accordance with the terms of this document."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
