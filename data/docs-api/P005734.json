As formally stated in the Staff Appraisal Report\n            (SAR), the objectives of the project were to: (i) accelerate\n            the adaptation of the labor force through more effective\n            training and labor market intermediation; and (ii) improve\n            existing human capital by developing in-company training\n            activities. In order to achieve its objectives, the project\n            included two components. The first component created a\n            regionally based Employment and Training Fund (ETF) to\n            finance sub-projects aimed at facilitating the placement of\n            the unemployed into existing job opportunities, as well as\n            improving productivity of existing workers through\n            systematic in-company training efforts. The second component\n            set up an institutional development program aimed at\n            strengthening key services to enterprises (selection,\n            placement and in-company training), developing job and\n            training information and orientation of young people and\n            adults, setting up a labor market insertion monitoring\n            system and strengthening project management. A number of\n            lessons can be learned in the design and implementation of\n            future similar operations. They can be drawn from key\n            factors that were critical to the success of the project, as\n            well as from those that could use further improvement. There\n            are five major lessons to be learned from the factors of\n            success: (a) The project benefited from its simple design,\n            as well as the economic vision that underpinned its design\n            and implementation (as opposed to one geared towards meeting\n            social needs).(b) The grass-roots \"bottom-up\"\n            approach ensured flexible implementation, as well as\n            localproject ownership. (c) With its flexible project\n            design, the ETF allowed modifications during implementation\n            to reflect institutionalc hanges, as weUal s ongoing\n            evaluations of project impact.(d) The project became an\n            integral part of the Tunisian Employment Agency's\n            operations; this considerably increased its effectiveness.\n            The project management system was efficient, with respect to\n            both ongoing and post completion monitoring of\n            beneficiaries. (e) The fund approach resulted in local staff\n            learning how to prepare and evaluate project proposals; it\n            encouraged innovation, as well as competition between public\n            and private VT providers and between regions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Employment and Training Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Employment and Training\n
