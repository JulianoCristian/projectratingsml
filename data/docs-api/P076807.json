Some lessons learned\n            includes: the design and implementation of complex projects\n            involving substantial involvement of specialists in several\n            disciplines requires above average resource allocations. The\n            design of fairly complex technical assistance for planning\n            in projects with national coverage in poor rural areas might\n            require higher than usual preparation in terms of a thorough\n            assessment of existing community needs and available optimal\n            social delivery systems. The right amount of flexibility in\n            project design and implementation might be a key to project\n            success. In retrospect the project was too specific on\n            certain areas thus imposing a level of rigidity that\n            challenged its viability.  Institutions with a strong\n            mindset and with the capacity to manage a decentralized\n            program of interventions as well as the selection of\n            territories with ample social capital were a key to project\n            success. Managing expectations should become an integral\n            part of projects pioneering substantive and complex changes\n            in servicing rural communities. Inclusion of productive\n            activities in the project might add a level of complexity in\n            design and implementation but could be the key for project\n            success. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) should remain a\n            high priority during both project design and implementation\n            and weaknesses in the original arrangements and\n            responsibilities should be addressed as soon as detected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Infrastructure for Territorial\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile -
