Some lessons learned included: the first\n            lesson learned is that a more careful assessment of the\n            conditions on the ground should have been carried out and\n            considered during the design phase. The Kenya DLC was under\n            designed with respect to prevailing needs. The\n            one-size-fits-all approach to capacity and construction\n            design that was used for all other DLCs was unsuitable for\n            the Kenya context, and proved inappropriate, especially\n            since this was an innovative project. Another lesson learned\n            is that the borrower should have been allowed to continue\n            using its own designed Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)\n            module and the Bank task management team should have been\n            more hands-on with the client's M&E module by\n            evaluating and providing direction on the indicators. This\n            will have saved time on both sides. Bank management could\n            also have assigned an Information Solutions Group (ISG)\n            expert to be based in the country office to work with the\n            Government in implementing the project or at least provided\n            adequate supervision resources to enable local hire of the\n            desired expertise. The Bank could have been more proactive\n            in engaging with the KDLC and in using its services to\n            support the implementation of operations, through the use of\n            the different ICT tools provided by the Center and to\n            promote South-South knowledge exchanges."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Development Learning Center (DLC)

The first component, construction\n            and installation, entails setting up the DLC's\n            institutional, physical, and human resources requirements,\n            during the first year of the project, and prior to the start\n            up of the DLC's operations (year 2-5). The Directorate\n            of Personnel Management (DPM), Office of the President, is\n            responsible for implementing this component under the\n            leadership of a Project Coordinator. Construction of the DLC\n            facility includes a video-conference room, computer room, a\n            technical, and administrative center, as well as\n            electrical/telephone installations. Additionally, equipment\n            for a small aperture terminal VSAT satellite communication\n            terminal, telecommunications, and microprocessor equipment\n            will be supplied. The second component will assist DLC\n            operations, and its financial viability, i.e., financing\n            operational costs on a decreasing basis over the first four\n            years of operation. Institutional arrangements will be\n            established for the daily management of the DLC, with\n            particular attention to the interaction between DPM and the\n            DLC. This will become paramount in the preparation of a\n            business plan, based on a market study, that identifies\n            training needs, and capacity building, and, for the\n            development of a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan,\n            to be submitted on annual, and quarterly basis. The third\n            component will finance the processes involved in M&E\n            training, and development plan, supported by consultants\n            whose aim will be to promote an external independent\n            assessment outside DLC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Development Learning Centre Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Development Learning\n            Centre Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/09/2538799/kenya-development-learning-centre-project","projn":"KE-Development Learning Centre Project -- P078209","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Teaching and Learning,Educational Sciences,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,ICT Policy and Strategies","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Kenya","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20031007144135"},"subsc":"General education sector,General public administration sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"& Evaluation,achievement,audits,business\n            information,business plans,capacity\n            building,CAS,collaboration,Competitive Bidding,corrective\n            actions,corruption,course material,curriculum,data\n            services,decision makers,decision\n            making,demonstration,Distance Learning,evaluation\n            results,Exchange Rate,Gender,General education,information\n            needs,Innovation,knowledge sharing,Learning,learning\n            activities,Learning Centers,learning needs,learning\n            tools,M&E capacity,Monitoring,Monitoring &\n            Evaluation,Needs assessment,partner organizations,per capita\n            income,performance indicators,positive feedback,private\n            sector,programming,programs,Project evaluation,project\n            impacts,project management,Public Sector,service\n            delivery,Sustainable Development,Technical\n            Assistance,trainees,training activities,training\n            courses,training programs,training providers,universities"},"1":{"cdata!":"& Evaluation,achievement,audits,business\n            information,business plans,capacity\n            building,CAS,collaboration,Competitive Bidding,corrective\n            actions,corruption,course material,curriculum,data\n            services,decision makers,decision\n            making,demonstration,Distance Learning,evaluation\n            results,Exchange Rate,Gender,General education,information\n            needs,Innovation,knowledge sharing,Learning,learning\n            activities,Learning Centers,learning needs,learning\n            tools,M&E capacity,Monitoring,Monitoring &\n            Evaluation,Needs assessment,partner organizations,per capita\n            income,performance indicators,positive feedback,private\n            sector,programming,programs,Project evaluation,project\n            impacts,project management,Public Sector,service\n            delivery,Sustainable Development,Technical\n            Assistance,trainees,training activities,training\n            courses,training programs,training providers,universities"}},"owner":"WB Off: Nairobi - Eastern AFR 2 (AFCE2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Learning and Innovation Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"24513"},"facets":{}}}
