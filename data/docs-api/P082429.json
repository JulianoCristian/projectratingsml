Some lessons\n            learned included: there is existing demand at the municipal\n            level for in-depth and continuous technical support for risk\n            mitigation actions. Instituto de hidrologia, meteorologia, y\n            estudios ambientales, institute of hydrology, meteorology,\n            and environment studies (IDEAM's) work has the\n            potential to contribute to the development of climate risk\n            parametric insurance tools. Such tools can be supported in a\n            follow-up operation, and furthermore, use the successful\n            experience from other countries in that area. An in-depth\n            institutional assessment as well as the preparation of a\n            capacity development plan for unidad nacional para la\n            gestion del riesgo de desastres, national unit for disaster\n            risk management (UNGRD) will help define the institutional\n            and implementation arrangements for a potential phase II. In\n            terms of monitoring and evaluation (M and E), the project\n            demonstrated the limits of a quantitative results framework\n            (RF). It highlighted the critical need to design, from\n            entry, some indicators and or an M and E system that can\n            capture the outcomes produced by the project. There was a\n            good synergy between this International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) operation and global\n            facility for disaster reduction and recovery (GFDRR) grants,\n            targeting specific areas of technical assistance (TA) and\n            delivering extra-outcomes and positive impacts around the

The World Bank approved on December 15,\n            2011, a restructuring to the Loan Agreement (LA) for the\n            project for an increase of the threshold of the special\n            account from US$2 million to US$4.5 million. The authorities\n            remain committed to the project and have requested that the\n            Bank reissues the amendment letter for an increase of the\n            threshold of the special account. This increase will help\n            the implementing agencies make progress on the commitments\n            already established and achieve the investment objectives\n            planned under the project period. The project remains in\n            good performance status as documented in the December\n            restructuring paper (RP). The current Implementation Summary\n            Report (ISR) rating (February 13, 2012) is\n            'satisfactory' for both the progress towards\n            achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) and\n            the overall Implementation Progress (IP). Financial\n            Management (FM) for the project is currently rated as\n            moderately satisfactory and procurement is rated as\n            satisfactory. The undisbursed balance as of May 2, 2012 was\n            US$18.37 million (16.7% of loan proceeds). This is a level\n            two restructuring, and there is no change in the PDO which\n            continues to be achievable.
