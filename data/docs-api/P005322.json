The project provides the first \"best\n            practice\" example for the use of a World Bank guarantee\n            in the telecommunications sector. Lessons learned include:\n            the support of regulatory reforms does not end with the\n            creation of the independent sector regulator; the effective\n            implementation of different financial instruments ensured\n            the investment program finance and stimulated the\n            enhancement of financial management skills and positive\n            evolution of the Jordan Telecommunications\n            Corporation's corporate culture; privatization\n            transactions should be preceded by a well designed public\n            relations campaign and involve all current and potential\n            stake holders in the sector; cofinancing arrangements should\n            be secured as early as possible in project preparation; and\n            the
