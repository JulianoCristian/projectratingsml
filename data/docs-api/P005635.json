It comprises a\n            system of 330 km of main pipeline to Tunis, Sousse, Gafsa\n            and Tadjerouine, and about 170 km of branch lines. It also\n            provides for the conversion of customers' equipment to\n            enable them to use gas as well as oil. The project includes\n            consultancy services for project design, engineering and\n            management, as well as studies on the technical, financial\n            and economic feasibility of supplying natural gas to small\n            scale industry and domestic consumers, and optimization\n            studies for Phase II of the pipeline system. Furthermore, a\n            training program will be carried out in Tunisia and abroad,\n            for the management, technical and operational staff for the\n            purposes of the project. The project will substitute natural\n            gas, imported on favorable terms, for higher cost fuel oil,\n            thus yielding a net foreign exchange saving of not less than\n            $120 million a year. It will contribute to the improvement\n            of air quality in Tunisia's cities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Natural Gas Pipeline Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia -

- Second Natural Gas Pipeline Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project will help supply natural gas\n            from the Algeria-Italy pipeline to industrial users and\n            power plants in Tunisia's major cities. It comprises a\n            system of 330 km of main pipeline to Tunis, Sousse, Gafsa\n            and Tadjerouine, and about 170 km of branch lines. It also\n            provides for the conversion of customers' equipment to\n            enable them to use gas as well as oil. The project includes\n            consultancy services for project design, engineering and\n            management, as well as studies on the technical, financial\n            and economic feasibility of supplying natural gas to small\n            scale industry and domestic consumers, and optimization\n            studies for Phase II of the pipeline system. Furthermore, a\n            training program will be carried out in Tunisia and abroad,\n            for the management, technical and operational staff for the\n            purposes of the project. The project will substitute natural\n            gas, imported on favorable terms, for higher cost fuel oil,\n            thus yielding a net foreign exchange saving of not less than\n            $120 million a year. It will contribute to the improvement\n            of air quality in Tunisia's cities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Natural Gas Pipeline Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Second Natural Gas\n            Pipeline Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1980/05/726333/tunisia-second-natural-gas-pipeline-project","projn":"TN-Gas Distribution-114143 -- P005635","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Water and Industry,Transport and Environment,Energy and Environment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912491347"},"subsc":"(Historic)Oil and gas transportation","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"alternative energy,atmosphere,aviation\n            fuel,barrel,barrel of oil,block valves,butane,cathodic\n            protection,coal,commercial energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,consumption of oil,cooking,crude\n            oil,distribution company,distribution of\n            electricity,Electricity,electricity generation,energy\n            demand,energy planning,energy policy,energy prices,Energy\n            resources,energy source,energy use,fuel,fuel oil,fuel oil\n            prices,fuel prices,fuels,Gas availability,gas\n            distribution,gas distribution system,gas division,gas\n            field,gas fields,gas industry,Gas oil,Gas Pipeline\n            Project,gas pipelines,gas prices,gas production,gas\n            purchase,gas reserves,gas sector,gas storage,gas\n            supplies,gas supply,gas supply contract,gas\n            turbines,gasoline,gasolines,growth in energy demand,high\n            sulphur,hydrocarbons,income,industrial\n            use,kerosene,lighting,Liquified Petroleum Gas,motor\n            fuels,national energy,Natural Gas,Natural Gas\n            Pipeline,natural gas resources,offshore gas,oil,oil and\n            gas,oil companies,oil company,oil demand,oil equivalent,oil\n            exporting,oil exporting countries,oil field,oil fields,Oil\n            production,Oil products,onshore gas\n            pipeline,Petroleum,Petroleum prices,petroleum\n            products,petroleum reserves,petroleum sector,pipe-\n            line,pipeline construction,pipeline cost,pipeline\n            routes,pipeline system,pipelines,power generation,power\n            plants,primary energy,production levels,project\n            management,proven reserves,pumps,refined\n            products,Refinery,refinery operations,refining,rocks"},"1":{"cdata!":"alternative energy,atmosphere,aviation\n            fuel,barrel,barrel of oil,block valves,butane,cathodic\n            protection,coal,commercial energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,consumption of oil,cooking,crude\n            oil,distribution company,distribution of\n            electricity,Electricity,electricity generation,energy\n            demand,energy planning,energy policy,energy prices,Energy\n            resources,energy source,energy use,fuel,fuel oil,fuel oil\n            prices,fuel prices,fuels,Gas availability,gas\n            distribution,gas distribution system,gas division,gas\n            field,gas fields,gas industry,Gas oil,Gas Pipeline\n            Project,gas pipelines,gas prices,gas production,gas\n            purchase,gas reserves,gas sector,gas storage,gas\n            supplies,gas supply,gas supply contract,gas\n            turbines,gasoline,gasolines,growth in energy demand,high\n            sulphur,hydrocarbons,income,industrial\n            use,kerosene,lighting,Liquified Petroleum Gas,motor\n            fuels,national energy,Natural Gas,Natural Gas\n            Pipeline,natural gas resources,offshore gas,oil,oil and\n            gas,oil companies,oil company,oil demand,oil equivalent,oil\n            exporting,oil exporting countries,oil field,oil fields,Oil\n            production,Oil products,onshore gas\n            pipeline,Petroleum,Petroleum prices,petroleum\n            products,petroleum reserves,petroleum sector,pipe-\n            line,pipeline construction,pipeline cost,pipeline\n            routes,pipeline system,pipelines,power generation,power\n            plants,primary energy,production levels,project\n            management,proven reserves,pumps,refined\n            products,Refinery,refinery operations,refining,rocks"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"2878"},"facets":{}}}
