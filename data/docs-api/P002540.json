The Multisector Project (MSP) was aimed at\n            mitigating the social and economic impact of economic\n            decline and structural adjustment by generating income and\n            employment opportunities for low-income, underemployed and\n            unemployed urban and rural households through components\n            for: (a) education: including the supply, storage, and\n            distribution of text books; (b) health: including provision\n            of a facility to help support the immediate phase of an\n            Integrated Malaria Control Program; (c) physical\n            infrastructure: including rehabilitation of water supply and\n            construction of a municipal market in the capital city of\n            SaoTome; and (d) private sector development by means of a\n            line of credit (LOC). The overall project outcome is judged\n            as less than satisfactory. IDA's role throughout\n            project preparation and appraisal, bank and borrower's\n            performance was satisfactory. The principal lessons learned\n            during project preparation and implementation are: project\n            design should conform to the realities of the adjustment\n            process in a country. This lesson is best illustrated by the\n            experience with the private sector component. It was assumed\n            erroneously that as privatization progressed there would be\n            great demand for credit in the private sector, particularly\n            if the economy was growing. It was also assumed erroneously\n            that financial sector reform would take place rapidly.to the\n            extent possible, counterpart contributions should be secured\n            as part of the conditions for credit effectiveness.The\n            objectives of this Project, are similar to the MSP, although\n            its focus is on infrastructure rehabilitation. However, as\n            for the MSP, the second project was also unable to deal with\n            the issues of counterpart funds, technical assistance and\n            autonomy of social funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sao Tome and Principe - Multisector I Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sao Tome and Principe -\n            Multisector I
