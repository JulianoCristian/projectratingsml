Some\n            lessons learned included: modernization of irrigation\n            infrastructure and on-farm technology improvements is a\n            necessary but not sufficient condition to increase\n            competitiveness in irrigated agriculture. Irrigation\n            improvement interventions need to be accompanied by actions\n            that support farmers and producers, particularly the small\n            ones, in the areas of organization, financial management and\n            commercialization. Modernization of irrigation projects,\n            particularly within the DR a (Irrigation Districts or\n            Distritos de Riego) and UR (Irrigation Units or Unidades de\n            Riego) located in over-exploited aquifers and/or\n            over-allocated surface water resources, should be done\n            within an integral water resources management framework,\n            where the water balance, the availability of the resource,\n            and other users including environmental water needs are\n            taken into account. Particularly crucial for the\n            optimization of benefits that could be derived from\n            water-saving technologies is the provision of technical\n            assistance to farmers as a complement to the on-farm\n            investments for at least the first agriculture-year. Since\n            the project appears to have benefited the already better-off\n            farmers and/or agricultural producers, the greater project\n            absorption by small farmers and producers will require\n            special targeting mechanisms, implicit eligibility criteria\n            and special financial terms to participate. Since irrigation\n            modernization and technological improvements are\n            medium-term, it is necessary to ensure that these programs\n            and multiannual, so unnecessary delays are avoided."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Integrated Irrigation Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Integrated Irrigation\n            Modernization

    assist the Government of Mexico in its efforts to adopt a\n            new model to improve the competitiveness of irrigated\n            agriculture and the efficiency of irrigation water use, in\n            both Irrigation Districts (Distritos de Riego, DR) and\n            Irrigation Units (Unidudes de Riego, UR), that would include\n            the development of partnerships between the public and\n            private sectors as well as effective institutional\n            collaboration within the public sector, plus the\n            strengthening of a demand-driven approach to investment\n            decisions and financing. The project has the following four\n            components: Component 1) will finance demand-driven\n            investment sub-projects aimed at improving the efficiency of\n            water distribution to rehabilitate and modernize irrigation\n            infrastructure as well as to improve conservation and\n            maintenance machinery and equipment within the framework of\n            IIIPs. Component 2) will support demand-driven investments\n            subprojects prepared by water users in irrigation districts\n            (DR) and irrigation units (UR), within the framework of\n            IIIPs, and presented to their respective local project\n            authorities for financing. Under this component, the\n            project, through CNA will provide technical and financial\n            assistance to beneficiaries to improve on-farm irrigation\n            systems and water use efficiency, but at the same time,\n            through an agreement with SAGARPA, project beneficiaries\n            would receive financial support and technical assistance\n            from the ongoing government program Alianza Contigo to\n            increase agricultural productivity, diversify production and\n            improve their marketing capabilities. Component 3) the\n            objective is to strengthen water users' associations\n            and improve their technical, managerial and financial\n            capabilities to administer and operate their respective\n            irrigation systems as well as participate in the decision\n            making process regarding Integrated Irrigation Modernization\n            Project (PMIR) investment financing.
