These objectives would be achieved by providing:\n            (a) engineering design, procurement assistance, review of\n            detailed engineering by contractors, and initial\n            construction supervision for the Escravos-Lagos pipeline\n            (ELP) project; (b) assistance in establishment of\n            NNPC's Gas Unit, including training, organization, and\n            management and operating assistance for the ELP system; (c)\n            engineering services for future gas supply expansion in the\n            western delta area, for feasibility studies for
