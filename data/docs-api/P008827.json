This report i s based on the Implementation\n            Completion Reports for the projects, legal documents and\n            project files, and discussions with Bank staff involved in\n            the projects. The ratings of the PPAR generally concur with\n            the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) ratings, except\n            in the following instances : Housing Project- outcome (ICR\n            unsatisfactory, PPAR moderately unsatisfactory); and for the\n            Enterprise Housing Divestiture, sustainability (ICR\n            unlikely, PPAR highly unlikely), bank performance (ICR\n            unsatisfactory, PPAR highly unsatisfactory); borrower\n            performance (ICR unsatisfactory, PPAR highly\n            unsatisfactory). Lessons learned include the following:\n            reformers need to move on quickly to find sustainable\n            solutions for the poor, who have drawn no benefit from\n            project results thus far; project design should incorporate\n            performance-related criteria to determine the allocation o f\n            resources across cities; When Borrowers find themselves in\n            disagreement with project objectives, the Bank should help\n            them recognize the need to formally restructure or cancel an\n            operation;  and concerns of municipalities governments and\n            private developers need to be addressed, for more public\n            land to become available."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russia -  Housing Project and Enterprise\n            Housing Divestiture Project (EHDP)."},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russia -  Housing Project and\n            Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project (EHDP)."}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6068038/russia-housing-project-enterprise-housing-divestiture-project-ehdp","projn":"RU-Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project -- P036973,RU-Housing -- P008827","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20050715153049"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General energy sector,Energy efficiency in Heat and Power,Roads and highways,Housing finance,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General public administration sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Energy and mining,Transportation,Finance,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, accounting, actual cost,\n            apartment, apartment buildings, apartments, auctions,\n            audits, Bank management, Bank Performance, Bank supervision,\n            borrowing, Building Materials, building materials industry,\n            Cities, commercial banks, Construction, construction\n            industry, consumers, cost of capital, debt,\n            Decentralization, dwelling, dwelling units, dwellings,\n            energy consumption, family buildings, fiscal policy, Fiscal\n            Year, foreign exchange, Households, houses, HOUSING, Housing\n            Allowances, Housing Construction, Housing Costs, Housing\n            Development, Housing Developments, housing finance, Housing\n            Maintenance, Housing Market, housing markets, housing\n            policy, housing programs, HOUSING PROJECT, Housing Projects,\n            Housing Reform, housing reforms, Housing Stock, housing\n            units, income, Inflation, inhabitants, Institutional\n            Development, land development, land ownership, Land Supply,\n            land use, Laws, Legal framework, legislation, local\n            government, Local Level, maintenance services, Mortgage\n            Lending, municipal development, municipal finance, municipal\n            governments, municipal housing, Municipal officials,\n            Municipalities, municipality, natural resources, operating\n            costs, peer review, Poverty Reduction, private developers,\n            Private Housing, Privatization, Public Housing, rent reform,\n            rents, Repair, Savings, settlement, shelter, streets,\n            structural adjustment, subsidiary, subsidized housing,\n            technical assistance, urban development, urban economy,\n            Urban Land, urban population, user charges, utilities"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF021836-FINNISH CTF FOR EASTERN &\n            CENTRAL EUROPE,TF022620-CANADIAN CTF FOR E. & C.\n            EUROPE & THE CIS,TF023660-DUTCH CTF FOR EASTERN EUROPE,TF024805-USAID-HOUSING ASSIST.

The lessons learned\n            indicate that reducing the time needed for careful\n            preparation and increasing the size of the loan for\n            project-external political factors was a decision that put\n            the project at risk from the outset and was to a large and\n            critical extent responsible for the factors that prevented\n            the operation from attaining its objectives in terms of both\n            development outcome and project output. As it was, the\n            project was too large and too ambition in its objectives for\n            the then context of Russia. A smaller pilot-operation type\n            project with more modest objectives and a shorter duration\n            would have had significantly better prospects of successful\n            completion and achievement of outcome. Even though it was\n            clear from an early point onward that the project would\n            achieve neither its objectives nor output and disbursement\n            targets, supervision efforts were primarily directed at\n            keeping the project going or exploring alternative ways to\n            increase disbursements. The resources spent on these efforts\n            could have been more profitably used in the preparation of\n            new operations responding to the actual needs of the sector.\n            By discounting the problems of demand, especially given the\n            then existing social and economic context of Russia, was a\n            serious mistake. While not a foregone conclusion in that\n            environment, a more balanced approach would probably have\n            had better prospects of having a successful and lasting\n            policy impact. While attractive, innovative and seemingly\n            the most efficient solution for implementation management at\n            the time of project preparation, the 'General\n            Consultant' became a costly legacy and source of\n            possible conflicts of interest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Housing Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation -
