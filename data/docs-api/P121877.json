Some lessons learned includes: sectoral\n            development policy operations can be quickly mobilized and\n            achieve good results in the context of strong reform\n            momentum. The Bank has the ability to respond quickly to\n            provide budget support when facilitated by strong government\n            ownership of a reform agenda. The government had a deep\n            commitment to a sector-specific reform agenda which formed a\n            ready foundation for the operation when the country needed\n            budget support. The Bank's engagement provided momentum\n            in the right direction at a time when the reform agenda\n            could have gone off-track due to multiple challenges then\n            facing the governments. Project level engagement can assist\n            in identifying key priorities to be supported through policy\n            operations. Close coordination and engagement with other\n            development partners in identification of policy priorities\n            is useful in sectors where the Bank has limited knowledge\n            and engagement. Both technical assistance and investment\n            support are more effective when there are real plans and\n            opportunities to put it into practice as in the case of the\n            development and implementation of the Tonga Energy Road Map\n            (TERM). In the case of a small country like Tonga there is a\n            real value and efficiency in packaging reforms in key\n            sectors like energy. Preparation and implementation\n            resources irrespective of the size of the country, the level\n            of effort of the Bank staff in development and\n            implementation of projects and policy operations is the\n            same. In the case of a country like Tonga, though the\n            country is small, the staff time and effort involved in the\n            operation is close to those in larger economies. When the\n            Bank implements these types of operations in Pacific\n            countries, there is a demonstration effect on other\n            neighboring countries and they also become interested in\n            having similar operations. Government commitment for a\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO) to be successful a\n            country's commitment is crucial and it will not work\n            just by exerting pressure by the Bank or other donors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tonga - Energy Sector Development Policy\n            Operation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga - Energy Sector Development\n

           Development Policy Operation Program are to contribute to\n            reducing Tonga's fiscal deficit and to support the\n            Government's efforts in implementing reforms in the\n            energy sector which will contribute to achieving steady and\n            stable growth in the medium term. The program will provide\n            budget support to reduce the near-term fiscal deficit. It\n            will also reinforce the importance of implementation of\n            energy sector reforms necessary to reduce Tonga's\n            vulnerability to oil price rise and shocks, which otherwise\n            will pose a significant risk to achieving stable growth in\n            the medium term. Like other Pacific Island nations, Tonga is\n            highly vulnerable to natural disasters and to external\n            economic shocks because of its small size combined with a\n            large distance from the nearest large market. The knock-on\n            effects of the global economic crisis, in particular in\n            remittances and tourism revenues, contributed to Gross\n            Domestic Product (GDP) contractions of 0.4 percent in\n            FY2008-09 and an estimated 0.5 percent in FY2009-10. As the\n            government recognized the extent to which its tax revenues\n            had been affected by the global economic crisis last year,\n            it took emergency measures to limit recurrent expenditures\n            including imposing lower ceilings on the expenditures in\n            most ministries toward the end of FY2009-2010. It also\n            sought budget support in the form of grants from donors.\n            While the outlook is for growth to recover in FY2010-2011 to\n            around 1.5 to 2 percent, downside risks remain. Containing\n            expenditure to the level set in the budget will be\n            challenging, even with greater attention to expenditure\n            prioritization, given the emergency-nature of the budget\n            cuts already instituted in FY2009-10."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tonga - Energy Sector Development Policy\n            Operation Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tonga
