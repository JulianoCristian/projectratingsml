Lessons learned from the\n            project: the execution of the project confirmed the\n            efficiency of result-based contracts for road maintenance\n            and rehabilitation contracts, even in a fiscally-constrained\n            environment. Fundamental political preferences are\n            highlighted in a highly fiscally-constrained environment.\n            The implementation of the project suffered from two main\n            external implementation delays: (a) a 15 months delay in\n            effectiveness; (b) a 3-years implementation delay,\n            reflecting the tight fiscal situation at the level of the\n            state, and the ensuing difficulties for the Government, in\n            such context, to prioritize financing of project\n            expenditures. As part of the project restructuring, it was\n            agreed that the project implementation period would be\n            extended by two years, but that the second year extension\n            would be subject to the achievement, during the first year\n            of a specific implementation target, to confirm the validity\n            of the project restructuring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
