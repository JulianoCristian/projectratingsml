The lessons learned indicate that\n            introduction of provider contracting and changes in provider\n            payment mechanisms need to be supported by substantial\n            efforts to increase information flow, provider\n            accountability, quality assurance and appropriate service\n            delivery reforms to achieve the expected results. Unless\n            public financing constitutes a significant share of provider\n            income and the purchaser has the ability to enforce\n            accountability, new provider payment systems are unlikely to\n            have a significant impact on provider performance and\n            efficiency. In a system with substantial excess capacity,\n            payment reforms and provider autonomy alone will not result\n            in significant efficiency improvements nor systems\n            rationalization, if not supported by more decisive measures\n            to concentrate resources on selected providers or active\n            supply side interventions to reduce over capacity. Need to\n            supplement class room and hospital based family medicine\n            training with clinical training to allow family doctors to\n            gain hands on experience in clinical setting. Need to\n            improve the regulatory framework for family medicine in\n            order to ensure that newly trained family doctors and family\n            medicine nurses can practice their new skills and family\n            medicine concept. The project demonstrated that any design\n            weaknesses and/or emerging policy issues can be effectively\n            addressed during implementation by using other Bank\n            instruments, such as a structural adjustment lending program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia -

Child welfare note"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This Note was prepared in response to\n            the needs for technical assistance expressed by the the\n            Ministries responsible for child welfare and child\n            protection in Armenia. With the Ministry of Education and\n            with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social Security\n            is developing a child welfare strategy, which will feed into\n            the Poverty Reduction Strategy that is currently being\n            drafted by the Armenian Government. The purpose of this Note\n            is to assist the preparation of the child welfare strategy\n            by identifying major issues in family and child welfare,\n            assessing efficiency and effectiveness of current policies\n            and suggesting measures that would better ensure the\n            well-being and future of Armenia's children. This note\n            discusses the dramatic political, economic, and social\n            changes that Armenia went through over the 1990s. Some of\n            them, especially prolonged economic hardship and extensive\n            out-migration have had a criticial impact on child welfare;\n            they have weakened the capacity of Armenia families to\n            manage risks, as well as the ability of the state to provide\n            meaningful support. Other factors contributing to the\n            current state of child welfare include high poverty risk,\n            low health and nutrition status, lesser access to education,\n            effects of migration, and the increased risk of joining an\n            underclass of children deprived of family upbringing. The\n            government will have to focus on a number of key issues in\n            creating an environment ensuring family and child well-being."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Child welfare

health care\n            reform. Its objectives are to: 1) improve primary health\n            care quality and efficiency; 2) improve efficiency,\n            transparency, and targeting of public health spending; and\n            3) mobilize communities to take an active role in defining\n            local health care priorities and sustaining basic health\n            care services. The project consists of 3 components:\n            strengthening the primary health care system, strengthening\n            the health financing system, and project management. The\n            primary health care system will be strengthened by: 1)\n            training and retraining primary health care staff, providing\n            technical assistance for curriculum development and a\n            business plan to include indicators and benchmarks\n            monitoring service improvements and incentives for staff; 2)\n            introducing practice guidelines for preventive health care,\n            including screening and diagnostic procedures, medical case\n            management, practice management, and reporting to national\n            and local health authorities; and 3) improving the\n            infrastructure and equipment in selected PHC facilities.\n            Health financing reform will: 1) support the design and\n            establishment of a State Health Agency and Health Management\n            Information System, the latter consisting of the design of\n            new medical and financial reporting forms, and automation of\n            data collection and analysis, payments and accounting; 2)\n            improve basic benefits package methodology; and 3) develop\n            provider payment methodology, including standardizing\n            contracts, monitoring performance, and implementing a plan\n            to legalize and regulate private payments to health care workers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Health Financing and Primary Care\n            Health Care Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Armenia - Health Financing and\n
