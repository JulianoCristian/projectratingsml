Some lessons learned includes: the\n            lack of a common understanding of the respective roles and\n            level of autonomy of all parties in a decentralized\n            management structure can undermine implementation. In this\n            case differences in interpretation of the level of autonomy\n            delegated to state level actors contributed to an impasse\n            between some of the state coordination units and the\n            national implementing agency that threatened to end project\n            implementation and contributed to an inspection panel\n            request. The project's experience reveals the\n            challenges associated with developing monitoring tools that\n            are adequate for both conservation and capacity building\n            objectives. Participatory monitoring is important for\n            enhancing community capacity to monitor and make decisions\n            over the management of their natural resources. The\n            project's experience in carrying out participatory\n            monitoring demonstrates the need to employ methods that are\n            useful to communities and can be continued beyond the\n            project's closure. While community participation was\n            included in the monitoring exercise, the methods used were\n            out of step with the community's capacity to continue\n            monitoring over the long term. A recurring shortcoming in\n            the implementation of small grant type projects is the\n            failure to monitor subproject outcomes. Since the\n            demand-driven nature of participatory operations like this\n            one limits the ability to specify objectives of\n            sub-projects. Up-front extra effort is required in the\n            course of implementation to document the goals communities\n            for themselves, their plan for achieving these goals, and to\n            monitor resulting outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Indigenous and Community\n            Biodiversity Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Indigenous and

(COINBIO) for Mexico were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance\n            was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: social capital\n            is an important result of investments but difficult to\n            quantify under traditional economic and financial analysis\n            methods. Proxies or models must be found to highlight the\n            value of the gains. Traditional economic valuation methods\n            of internal rate of return and net present value do not\n            always capture the value of generating social capital.\n            Investments that do not generate directly measureable\n            financial returns must be measured indirectly. New tools are\n            needed to help analysts cope with these demands, which are\n            of increasing importance. Community conservation projects\n            can serve as a focal-point for organization and breaking\n            cycles of conflict within communities. Many communities face\n            internal conflicts related to land disputes, politics,\n            financial management, and leadership while others may suffer\n            from a breakdown in social cohesion and focus for\n            development. The conservation model and approach promoted by\n            the project generated a relatively non-controversial theme\n            for communities to focus on, and helped to reinvigorate\n            their dialogue and cooperation in other community matters.\n            Market-based programs within conservation projects require\n            specialized skills and service providers as well as adequate\n            financial vehicles for these investments to be effective\n            conservation tools. Highly specialized knowledge and skills\n            are required to adequately advise beneficiaries on access to\n            markets. However, they are frequently difficult to find in\n            marginalized areas of the country. Studies to analyze\n            markets can and should be carried out during preparation,\n            and during implementation, but must be included in the\n            design and budget for both."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico - Indigenous and Community\n            Biodiversity Conservation Project (COINBIO)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mexico - Indigenous and Community\n

- Indigenous and Community\n            Biodiversity Project - Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"On January 26, 2004, the Inspection\n            Panel (Panel) received a Request for Inspection (Request)\n            related to the Indigenous and Community Biodiversity Project\n            in Mexico, which, in accordance with the Resolution\n            establishing the Inspection Panel (Resolution), the Panel\n            notified the Executive Directors and the President of the\n            Bank that it had received the Request, which constituted\n            Registration of the Request, under the Panel's\n            Operating Procedures. The Panel received Bank\n            Management's Response to the Request on March 2, 2004\n            (Management Response). This report  determines the\n            eligibility of the Request, and makes a recommendation as to\n            whether the Panel should investigate the matters alleged in\n            the Request. The objective of the Project is to conserve\n            high biodiversity areas in the states of Oaxaca, Michoacan,\n            and Guerrero, by strengthening and promoting community\n            conservation initiatives on communally-owned lands, building\n            on their cultural values, and practices, developed in\n            relationship to the resources in these areas. According to\n            the Request, the Bank has violated its policies and\n            procedures on project supervision and indigenous peoples,\n            because it has proposed a restructuring of the Project\n            without involving the State Committees. It alleges that the\n            Bank has proposed modifying the Project so as \"to\n            divest the State Committees of their authority and vest the\n            national coordinator with full powers.''\n            Management states that \"as of October 2003, discussions\n            had not yet advanced to the stage of specific restructuring\n            proposals to be considered by the State Committees,\"\n            adding it \"will continue to involve systematic\n            consultation with Project stakeholders.\"  The Panel\n            observed that the Bank's supervision of the Project\n            appears to have been inadequate in certain respects, and, an\n            issue of broader concern to the Panel is the proposed\n            restructuring of the Project, particularly given the\n            Project's \"demand-driven\" nature. The Request\n            and Management Response contain conflicting assertions, and\n            interpretations about the issues, the facts, and compliance\n            with Bank policies and procedures. Moreover, the Panel\n            continues to be very concerned that a restructuring of the\n            Project not be detrimental to the interests of the\n            indigenous communities. In light of the foregoing, and in\n            fairness to all the parties concerned, the Panel cannot take\n            a position at this time on whether the Request merits an\n            investigation, and awaits further developments."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
