The lessons\n            learned indicated that the objectives were set by the\n            country and the Bank's flexible approach allowed timely\n            achievement of development objectives. The Bank agreed on a\n            financial package but not on a five-year blueprint detailing\n            how to spend the money. The country was politically\n            committed to raising the health status of the poorest, to\n            decentralizing health services delivery, and to modernizing\n            its operations for serving the uninsured population better.\n            It was also recognized that reaching the poor in highly\n            dispersed geographical locations require substantial amount\n            of resources. While the project strengthened the supply of\n            basic health services, the Education, Health and Nutrition\n            Program (PROGRESA) combined a traditional cash transfer\n            program with financial incentives for families to invest in\n            human capital of children. The Government's full\n            commitment to decentralization of health services, and to\n            redefining and improving the Federal Secretariat of Health\n            policy-making, and stewardship roles within a decentralized\n            context were fundamental for the Government's ability\n            to provide successfully basic health care services in\n            dispersed

A\n            Mexican government initiative, the expansion of basic health\n            services program, has sought to reach these people. The\n            program is backed by a 660 million dollars loan from the\n            World Bank. An unprecedented collaboration between the\n            federal and local governments created hundreds of mobile\n            health units that deliver a basic health care package\n            including: basic sanitation, diarrhea control, family\n            planning, prevention and treatment of parasitic diseases,\n            health and nutrition information, immunizations, child\n            delivery, and prevention and control of tuberculosis and\n            cervical cancer."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Expanding health care in Mexico :\n            Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23808746/expanding-health-care-mexico-le-red\u00e9ploiement-des-soins-de-sant\u00e9-au-mexique","count":"Mexico","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Basic Health, basic health care, Basic\n            Health Services, cervical cancer, child delivery, diarrhea,\n            family planning, Health Care, health services, mobile health\n            units, nutrition, parasitic diseases, public health, public\n            health services, treatment, tuberculosis"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Sector Investment and Maintenance Loan"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Rural development,Public sector governance,Human development,Urban development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"},"1":{"cdata!":"Le red\u00e9ploiement des soins de sant\u00e9 au Mexique"}},"topic":"Health Care Performance Indicators\n            m1327298 1321,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625","projn":"MX-Iii Basic Health Care Project -- P066321,MX-Basic Health II -- P007689","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Health Economics & Finance,Disease Control & Prevention,Gender and Health,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Monitoring & Evaluation","teratopic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150116134151"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Latin America & Caribbean!$!119228"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Central government administration,Health,Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,Health","theme":"Health system performance,Rural services and infrastructure,Urban services and housing for the poor,Indigenous peoples,Decentralization,Health system performance,Participation and civic engagement,Rural services and infrastructure,Decentralization,Administrative and civil service reform","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Gender,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Care Performance Indicators\n            m1327298 1321,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Facility Management m1326575 1397,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Health Economics and Finance m1326577 625","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
