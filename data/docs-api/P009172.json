Missions fielded\n            by the Bank were balanced and had the necessary expertise to\n            provide the level of guidance and supervision necessary for\n            project implementation; however, Bank supervision probably\n            should have been more intensive in the first several years\n            of project implementation. The project was well conceived\n            and represents the best technical solution for providing a\n            reliable source of quality water for domestic and industrial\n            use and for irrigating small holdings. The project's\n            physical goals have been achieved, and the planned\n            infrastructure aimed at removing the main constraint on\n            agricultural and industrial development and improving health\n            standards is in place. With proper operation and\n            maintenance, the full potential benefits of this project\n            will be realized. The lessons learned from the project can\n            be summarized as follows: (a) The project was delayed\n            partially because of delays in the appointment of\n            consultants, leading to delays in the finalization of\n            project design. Final designs and bid documents for critical\n            elements of the project should be in an advanced stage of\n            preparation at the time of Board presentation; (b)\n            Acquisition of land went very smoothly. The 60 farmers whose\n            land was needed for the site of the reservoir were offered\n            irrigated land or cash compensation, and all 60 chose cash\n            compensation; (c) Boundary adjustment-land consolidation\n            presents difficult legal, technical and particularly social\n            problems and, therefore, the bank should be more cautious\n            and realistic in establishing implementation schedules when\n            these issues are involved; and (d) The issue of recovering\n            operation and maintenance costs, critical to the\n            sustainability of the project, is not yet resolved."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Metohija Multipurpose Water Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Metohija\n
