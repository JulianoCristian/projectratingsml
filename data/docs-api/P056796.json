The lessons\n            learned indicated that a credible threat of\n            foreclosure/bankruptcy is needed to elicit debtor\n            cooperation with court-supervised rehabilitations, or out of\n            the court workouts. An efficient framework for out of the\n            court workouts is necessary in a systemic crisis and can\n            financially stabilize distressed companies. Government must\n            be ready to impose losses on shareholders of domestic\n            financial institutions, and force a resolution of\n            over-valued assets.

There are 6 main components. The first aids\n            financial sector supervision and crisis management by\n            providing institution building for the Financial Supervisory\n            Commission (FSC), strengthening the financial institutions\n            crisis resolution strategy and implementation, and\n            developing methodologies and data generation. This component\n            develops FSC strategies, policies, procedures, and\n            capabilities; trains staff to become experts in new and\n            complex financial fields; improves technical analysis\n            capabilities; upgrades accounting systems; and redesigns\n            regulatory reports. Component 2 reforms the regulatory\n            framework for securities markets, rationalizing and\n            clarifying market rules, roles, and policies, and studying\n            in-depth the demand side of bond markets; improves\n            efficiency of government bond markets; and improves the\n            transparency of accounting and audit practices. Component 3\n            improves debt management by strengthening professional\n            capability, organizational arrangements, and information and\n            communication systems.
