The high rating for the outcome of the\n            project is justified by the fact that all four development\n            objectives (DOs) -out of which, three DOs were fully\n            achieved in cost-efficient and sustainable manner, despite\n            some implementation delays at the start of the project. The\n            project covered all Senegalese municipalities which made it\n            a single most important operation in the Senegalese\n            municipal sector and a backbone of the country's\n            decentralization reform. It also succeeded in disbursing the\n            entire credit amount (disbursed amount: US$81.3 million) and\n            the total project costs (US$110 million) in a coherent and\n            transparent manner. The project gave each municipality a\n            chance to learn to play by the new \"rules of the\n            game\" and to see their benefits. The project clearly\n            demonstrated that important changes took place in the\n            behavior of municipalities, namely: (a) they abided by\n            credit and auto financing discipline; (b) they complied with\n            reciprocal contractual obligations with the central\n            government through municipal contracts and agreements; (c)\n            they mastered and made use of new tools for programming\n            municipal investments; and (d) they bought into improving\n            municipal management practices, including taking difficult\n            staffing decisions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal -

The program's objectives are to (a)\n            improve the financial and organizational management of\n            municipalities; (b) improve the programming of priority\n            urban investments; (c) rationalize and simplify the\n            financing of urban investments; and (d) upgrade basic\n            infrastructure in urban and some rural communities. The\n            first principal component consists of building the capacity\n            of central and local governments through (1) implementing a\n            Municipal Adjustment Program (MAP) and (2) supporting\n            activities aimed at providing an enabling environment for\n            these MAPs to take place (such as training, fiscal reforms\n            study, etc.). The second principal component consists of\n            physical investments like building, rehabilitating, and\n            maintaining public infrastructure, facilities, and services\n            under the responsibility of local governments (roads,\n            drainage, and lighting;
