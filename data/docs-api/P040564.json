The\n            institutional development impact of the Pilot was rated as\n            substantial, while that for the SECAL project was only\n            modest. World Bank and Borrower performances in both\n            projects were rated as satisfactory. Several lessons were\n            learned: Quick-disbursing SECALs are inappropriate vehicles\n            for supporting sector restructuring programs. SECALs in\n            support of mine closures should be designed with several\n            small, flexible tranches, rather than a small numberof large\n            tranches. Projects designed to support setor restructuring\n            should have a clear focus on poverty reduction objectives.\n            The financial and economic performance of pilot projects\n            activities needs to be carefully monitored. The Bank needs\n            to make greater efforts to help improve the eficiency of\n            mine closure activities. The Bank should consider working\n            more closely with other bilateral and multicultural agencies\n            that are providing seed money for establishing local\n            cooperatives

- Coal Sector Adjustment Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is assessed as\n            satisfactory, but project sustainability is assessed as\n            unlikley on the basis that the policies as pursued under the\n            original Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL) design will probably\n            also in the near future not be fully implemented. Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are rated as satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included the following: The creation of the\n            Ukrainian State Company for Coal Sector Restructuring (UDKR)\n            has been a key to the success of this project. There have\n            been closures by mining companies but they were not finished\n            and normally these mines ended up with UDKR to complete the\n            task. The SECAL implementation also has shown that an agency\n            like UDKR needs to be protected. There have been attempts by\n            the coal industry and by local administrations to abolish or\n            weaken UDKR. Furthermore, the agency should have its own\n            fully secured budget. Another lesson is that an investment\n            operation is preferred over an adjustment operation since\n            restructuring depends critically on adequate financing.\n            Also, realistic goal-setting is important. The selection of\n            financial performance criteria for the restructuring of an\n            old industrial sector should be avoided. Instead, simple\n            physical criteria that can be achieved and easily monitored\n            should be preferred."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Coal Sector Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine -
