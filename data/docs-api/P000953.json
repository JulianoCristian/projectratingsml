In addition, the\n            institutional development impact was negligible, due to the\n            unexpected institutional development in the management\n            contract component, particularly as marginal improvements\n            reversed commercial performance indicators. Lessons\n            stipulate that: 1) large utility expansion programs require\n            financial sustainability, to sustain operations, and\n            maintenance once the investment is completed, in addition to\n            reforms to improve the prospects of financial viability.\n            However, experience suggests that independent regulation\n            takes much longer to take root, whereas a tariff regime\n            allowing for automatic adjustments may help alleviate the\n            overall problem; 2) the design of management contracts,\n            needs to grant autonomy to contractors to implement\n            decisions, and measures for improving performance\n            indicators, as well as payments to contractors should be\n            linked to specific measurable outcomes, with baseline\n            performance indicators, verifiable unambiguously, to\n            facilitate performance evaluation; and, 3) a new rural\n            energy strategy needs to be developed, to provide an\n            enabling policy framework, and low-cost design standards for\n            the sub-transmission, and distribution works. Additional\n            issues, underline adequate procurement arrangements, and\n            development of domestic contractor capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - National Electrification Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana -
