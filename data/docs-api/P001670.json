This assessment provides a\n            number of lessons for the education sector: Civil works have\n            procurement issues that may exceed the supervisory capacity\n            of the implementing units in low-income countries.\n            Private-sector contractors may be able to execute civil\n            works, but a lack of supervision may result in fraud,\n            vandalism, and poor-quality buildings. The complexities of\n            civil-works procurement may become the focus of education\n            projects at the expense of learning issues. Governments\n            should make efforts to employ staff with continuity and\n            expertise that would ensure efficient execution of civil\n            works and allow managers time to focus on learning-related\n            improvements. Textbooks or systematically reproduced\n            materials are a prerequisite for knowledge management at all\n            levels of education. Their sustained availability should be\n            a policy priority, particularly in countries where they are\n            expensive. Without textbooks and training of teachers in\n            their use, class time is spent in transcription; knowledge\n            becomes constricted and systemic efficiency is low. Because\n            of their crucial role, decisions on textbook purchases might\n            best not be left to the discretion and financial strength of\n            individual schools. A national strategy of sustainable and\n            affordable secondary education textbooks is needed in\n            low-income countries. Often projects provide inputs to\n            educational institutions and expect improved learning\n            outcomes as a result of these. To help student's\n            process information and retain it, however, instructionally\n            oriented interventions are needed. Project designs lacking\n            specific elements for improving the learning conditions of\n            schools may not obtain the needed learning and subsequent\n            educational outcomes. Large-scale curricular reforms will\n            only have a positive effect if curricula are realistically\n            implementable in classrooms. The Bank should be more\n            proactive in advising governments on realistic curricular\n            structures. Since curricular revisions often necessitate new\n            textbooks, it is important to ensure that there is\n            sufficient rationale for the revisions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -

were both satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project: The need to ensure consistence of\n            the PAD and DCA is important. A Clear Monitoring and\n            Evaluation Framework including capacity building should be\n            part of the project design. There should be mechanisms to\n            enforce the functioning of Oversight Committees. Contracting\n            work to private firms requires Government's capacity to\n            effectively supervise the firms. A framework for quality\n            assurance in relation to standards and specifications need\n            to be clear and available at school and other levels to\n            guide implementation and monitoring such as in relation to\n            civil works and different supplies. Adequate guidelines for\n            school mapping and site selection needs to be in place in\n            all education projects. Involvement of stakeholders within\n            communities where the schools have been constructed, was\n            insufficient. Well established mechanisms for coordination\n            should be in place in the government ministries to ensure\n            adequate support is provided in project implementation.\n            Issues of teacher supply, development and deployment need to\n            be addressed more comprehensively to ensure adequate supply\n            and effective deployment of qualified teachers for primary\n            and secondary education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malawi -

There are five\n            components in this project.  First, expanding access to\n            secondary education comprises all civil works activities\n            related to the construction of day secondary schools.  This\n            component will finance all school facilities, furniture and\n            equipment, library furnishings, teachers' housing,\n            playing fields, roads, etc.  Second, quality of secondary\n            education will provide instructional materials in the\n            project-financed schools.  For all other public conventional\n            schools, this component will provide textbooks, school\n            supplies, and coonsumables for sciences.  Third, efficiency\n            and effectiveness of secondary education will provide\n            training for school-based managers.  The credit will also\n            finance establishment of a small training unit, procurement,\n            and other monitoring activities. Fourth, the HIV/AIDS\n            materials component will finance the rapid adaptation of\n            high-quality, behavior-change instructional materials from\n            Zimbabwe, and the reprinting of some of materials.  Fifth,\n            support to administrative unit/monitoring &\n            evaluation/studies will cover the costs of procurement and a\n            computerized financial management
