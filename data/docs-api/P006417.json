Future efforts at providing urban services\n            in Brazil should focus upon replicating demonstrated\n            successes of best practice project municipalities. This\n            study seeks to learn how best practice project\n            municipalities succeeded in improving living condition of\n            the poor, and from these cases, to make practical\n            recommendation for policy makers in the sector. The\n            evaluation focuses upon a few key impact domains, notably\n            living conditions, 'decentralization and\n            beneficiaries' voice in improvements. Data collection\n            from both secondary sources and during missions to eleven\n            cities throughout Brazil enabled the study team to test\n            hypotheses of project impact within each of these domains.\n            Direct participation of final beneficiaries in the\n            evaluation gave important insights into project performance.\n            The study focused upon three impact domains: (i) living\n            conditions of the urban poor; (ii) decentralizing urban\n            service provision and; and (iii) users' voice and\n            learning about urban service provision. For each domain, the\n            evaluation team identified performance indicators and\n            formulated evaluation hypotheses for testing during field\n            visits to eleven cities throughout the country.
