Lessons learned include: integrated delivery\n            of these services is highly relevant for Afghanistan, where\n            the coverage is poor and mortality among children is high\n            due to water-borne diseases. Scaling up these services is\n            equally important and urgent. However, in Afghanistan,\n            unless the capacity of Government and other institutions is\n            built to operate effectively and the decentralization\n            approach continues to be strengthened, scaling up will not\n            happen. Furthermore, the demonstrated success of\n            community-based maintenance systems under the project needs\n            to be consolidated and scaled up. When a country is\n            transiting from an emergency reconstruction phase to a\n            well-advanced development phase, the challenge is to balance\n            quick delivery of services and sustainability. Similarly, in\n            the case of the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF)\n            RWSSP, the challenge was to balance the conflict between\n            sustainability and the need to provide services quickly to\n            the provinces. Unless this transition is clearly\n            communicated by the Government, emergency reconstruction\n            will be given higher priority than sustainability. Delayed\n            project start-up could have been avoided if recruitment of\n            key staff, such as the project manager, had been done\n            upfront. The long lead time is important for countries whose\n            security situation is not stable. Risk is inherently high in\n            the post-conflict period in Afghanistan. Thus, Bank\n            management's expectations need to be adjusted in line\n            with what can be reasonably achieved through such process\n            oriented projects. Implementation procedures should be\n            simplified, flexible enough to accommodate operational\n            effectiveness of institutions and specific implementation needs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Rural Water Supply\n            and Sanitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/06/12634123/afghanistan-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project","projn":"AF-Artf - Rural Water Supply And Sanitation\n            Project -- P091038","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Housing & Human Habitats,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Afghanistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100810035920"},"subsc":"Sanitation,Water supply","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Water Supply and Sanitation,Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate sanitation, administrative support,\n            appropriate technology, capacity building, Central\n            Government, cities, Community Development, Community Health,\n            community members, Community Participation, construction\n            activities, construction of infrastructure, contaminated\n            water, contract management, decision making, decision making\n            processes, delivery of water supply, districts, drilling\n            rig, drinking water, drought, Engineer, Engineers,\n            environmental health, environmental impacts, families,\n            female, Gender, ground water, ground water sources, hand\n            pump, hand pumps, hand washing, health care, health\n            conditions, holistic approach, households, hygiene, hygiene\n            education, hygiene promotion, interventions, investment\n            cost, latrine construction, laws, Local contractors,\n            maintenance of water, mobility, morbidity, mortality,\n            mortality rate, Performance Indicators, piped water, pit\n            latrines, Pollution, project management, provincial\n            governments, Public Health, Public Works, quality control,\n            renting, reservoirs, rural areas, rural communities, Rural\n            Development, RURAL WATER, RURAL WATER SUPPLY, safe drinking\n            water, safe water, safety, sanitation facilities, sanitation\n            sector, sanitation services, Sanitation Water, Sanitation\n            Water supply, service delivery, small rural towns,\n            sustainable use, sustainable water, sustainable water\n            supply, toilets, Urban Environment, urban water, village\n            level, villages, waste, waste disposal, water contamination,\n            water facilities, water point, water points, water\n            pollution, water quality, Water quality monitoring, Water\n            quality testing, water schemes, water sector, water\n            services, water sources, water storage, Water User, wells, Workers"}},"owner":"Urban, Water Supply & Sanitation (SASDU)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF055447-ARTF- RURAL WATER SUPPLY &\n            SANITATION PROJECT (RWSSP)","repnb":"ICR1365"},"facets":{}}}
