The key\n            lessons learned include: 1) Government commitment is\n            important. The government needs to build confidence through\n            steady and consistent implementation of reforms. There is a\n            perception that over the past decades, Kenya undertook\n            reforms in fits and starts. This intermittent approach to\n            reform has undermined confidence among aid sources and\n            business circles about government commitment. Staff turnover\n            was cited as a factor affecting commitment to\n            implementation. 2) A coherent policy design is important.\n            Given that containing the growth of the government wage bill\n            was very critical for consolidating fiscal and financial\n            stability, as well as improving the management of public\n            resources and redirecting support to priority non-wage\n            activities the social sectors, the design of the reform\n            program could have been more effective in capturing the main\n            pressures points on the wage bill. 3) Performance on\n            economic governance measures was less than expected, and\n            this affected overall policy performance. Key economic\n            governance issues, especially combating corruption,\n            enhancing transparency in budget allocation, expenditure\n            reporting, and enforcing accountability for the use of\n            public resources are now at the center of dialogue with the authorities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Structural Adjustment Credit

Letter of Development Policy which set out the\n            government's medium term strategy. This strategy has as\n            objective the reduction in poverty and unemployment through\n            an acceleration of economic growth. This is to achieved by:\n            1) strengthening monetary and public sector finance\n            management and consolidating fiscal discipline; 2)\n            accelerating and streamlining reform in the civil service\n            and public enterprises and improving the delivery of\n            infrastructural services; 3) liberalization of markets; 4)\n            addressing the social aspects of development; and 5)\n            eliminating corruption. The project will focus on government\n            reforms in the areas of public sector management, public\n            enterprise and civil service reform in line with the overall\n            medium term strategy. Specific reforms supported by the\n            project include: 1) improvement in the quality of public\n            expenditures through expenditure reallocation; 2)\n            enhancement of efficiency of key public enterprises through\n            restructuring and divestiture of activities; 3) reduction in\n            the size of the public sector through accelerated\n            privatization; and 4) reduction in the size of the civil\n            service and improvement in efficiency through ministerial\n            rationalization. At the macroeconomic level, the project\n            will support government efforts to consolidate the fiscal\n            position and improve Kenya's external position to\n            levels sustainable over the medium term."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Structural Adjustment\n            Credit
