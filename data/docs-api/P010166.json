The project achieved its main objectives, its\n            impact on institution building has been substantial, and\n            both the Bank and the Borrower acted satisfactorily.\n            However, sustainability is uncertain at this time. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, sustainable\n            training programs require linkages to established industry,\n            student counseling programs, and assistance in creating\n            small enterprises and self-employment opportunities. Second,\n            where major policy issues are beyond the control of a\n            project, but central to its concept, suitable implementation\n            arrangements need to be made. Third, serious problems and\n            delays in construction and equipment can divert attention\n            from wider issues of policy implementation under other\n            components. Lastly, early identification and regular review\n            of key project performance indicators can ensure balanced\n            supervision and help highlight areas requiring particular attention."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Second Education (Technical and\n            Vocational Training) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Second Education\n            (Technical and Vocational Training) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/10007166/nepal-second-education-technical-vocational-training-project","projn":"NP-Education II -- P010166","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Teaching and Learning,Access & Equity in Basic Education,Housing & Human Habitats,Primary Education,Tertiary Education","teratopic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Education","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20081110022038"},"subsc":"Vocational training","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Communities and Human Settlements,Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Career development;
