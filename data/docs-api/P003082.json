The\n            credit, approved in 1991, became effective in 1992.\n            Disbursements were suspended when the government failed to\n            meet its debt obligation to the International Development\n            Association (IDA) in 1993 and the country was placed on\n            non-accrual status. Macro-economic problems and lack of\n            counterpart funding made project implementation impossible\n            and projects could not achieve their development objectives.\n            In 1994 the credit was closed and the undisbursed balance\n            cancelled. Only 5 percent of the credit was disbursed, a\n            large part of which was to refund project preparation\n            expenditures and pay for technical assistance. The project\n            objectives were to: (a) stop the deterioration and improve\n            the quality of primary education, by taking immediate steps\n            to increase the availability of main educational inputs; and\n            (b) help the government implement its sector education\n            strategy to restore the conditions needed for long-term\n            balanced development of a more viable and adequately\n            financed education sector. The main lesson learned from this\n            project is that, since the Bank had foreseen the\n            deteriorating country situation, it should have adopted a\n            wait and see approach instead of processing this project\n            rapidly. In addition, the Bank was unwise to have waived\n            certain key conditions of effectiveness (the recruitment of\n            the resident economist and the French co-financing) in a\n            rush to declare the credit effective 15 months after board\n            presentation. In view of these factors, virtually no\n            activities took place after effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Education Sector Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire -
