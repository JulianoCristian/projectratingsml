The key objective of the Cocoa Rehabilitation\n            Project was to overcome the stagnation in cocoa output and\n            expand cocoa export earnings by helping modernize the cocoa\n            industry. Smallholder incomes and Government tax revenue\n            were expected to improve as a result. The project resulted\n            in no measurable increase of cocoa production or yields. The\n            Bank's performance was marginally satisfactory at\n            identification and preparation. Bank performance at\n            appraisal was unsatisfactory as there is no indication that\n            the lessons of the previous project, which had cost twice as\n            much as expected for no measurable results, were taken into\n            consideration. Borrower performance was satisfactory at\n            preparation but poor at implementation. The project's\n            overall rating is unsatisfactory. There are four main\n            lessons to be learned from this project: (a) Project\n            preparation should include an in-depth review of all aspects\n            of the project, including an assessment of the executing\n            agency, political and other vested interests, stakeholder\n            commitments and the Borrower's and beneficiaries'\n            ability to pay. (b) Privatizing inputs supply will not\n            generate a private sector response in the absence of\n            sufficient price incentives to use these inputs. (c)\n            Progress in achieving the project's development\n            objectives should be continually reviewed and where it is\n            clear that they are no longer achievable, alternatives need\n            to be considered (redesigning the project or closing it).\n            (d) Macro-economic conditions, and more especially the value\n            of the exchange rate, are critical for the success of a\n            number of agricultural operations, particularly those\n            dealing with exports."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
