Some lessons\n            learned included: although assessed as a high risk operation\n            at the time of appraisal, due to the conditions prevailing\n            at that time it was also viewed as the appropriate approach\n            to re-establishing control of the fisheries sector and\n            taking first steps toward its sustainable development.\n            Project objectives have been largely achieved, and the risky\n            strategy has proven to be appropriate. Frequent and\n            substantive guidance and support made available by the\n            supervision team was instrumental in capturing the benefits\n            of this approach. The availability and distribution of\n            Government subsidized fuel to fishing vessel owners via the\n            Fisheries Management Organizations (FMOs) provided an\n            economic incentive for vessel owners to become members, and\n            also helped FMOs establish financial self sufficiency. While\n            Government and sector stakeholders have achieved significant\n            progress in establishing the institutional framework for\n            co-management, sustainability of FMOs, their effective\n            operation of port facilities, and implementation of fishery\n            co-management will require continued leadership and\n            strategically targeted support from Government beyond the\n            five year life of the project.

To achieve these aims,\n            the project supports three main components. The first\n            component rehabilitates fishing port facilities and supports\n            the institutional strengthening of Fishery Management\n            Organizations to improve their management of fishing port\n            facilities, and to promote self-regulation as the key to\n            sustainable marine resource management. To that end, the\n            project recruits national coordiantors and regional\n            promoters, supplies international technical assistance to\n            the FMOs, prepares fishery management plans, develops marine\n            ecotourism, and supports training and demonstration\n            programs. The second component provides support to restock\n            carp in reservoirs, supports the Koran restocking program,\n            and pilots a program to test the aquaculture of new marine\n            and fresh water species such as tilapia and shrimp. The\n            third component finances legal training and assistance for\n            preparing technical documents, provides legal assitance to\n            support the Fisheries Directorate, supports a fisheries\n            management information system, and prepares a business plan\n            for the Fishery Research Institute."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania -

There are two major project\n            activities that may potentially present risks to the\n            environmental and ecology: a) the larger-scale aquaculture\n            activities for Koran, and high-value marine species; and b)\n            construction works for the rehabilitation of the fishing\n            ports.
