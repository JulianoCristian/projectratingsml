The overall\n            performances of both the World Bank and the borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. These were the lessons learned from the\n            project: Project design and implementation, Simplicity and\n            flexibility in project design are two essential\n            characteristics for loans with short implementation periods.\n            Avoiding complexity in project design (e.g. clear and\n            concise components, concrete objectives in line with\n            institutional capacity, realistic timing in output delivery,\n            etc.), allows for smoother implementation. Similarly,\n            projects that build in a flexible approach (e.g. confined,\n            demand-driven capacity building activities) are better\n            equipped to adapt to unforeseen shocks encountered during\n            implementation, ensuring their completion. Regarding\n            implementation, adopting a participatory consultative\n            process to develop project outputs and implement project\n            activities enhances continuity and sustainability in project\n            execution. While the degree of success and sustainability\n            varied among the 8 pilots, the most successful pilot\n            implementation teams were those that fully involved the\n            local communities in all decision-making, building ownership\n            and trust from the proposal stage until the closure of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - National

          improved environmental management by defining environmental\n            policy reforms and elaborating a National Environmental\n            Management Program (NEMP) through a learning and\n            participatory process. There are three components in this\n            project. First, supporting policy and institutional reform\n            will define priority legal, institutional, and fiscal\n            reforms to improve environmental management, define sectoral\n            action plans for environmental management reform, and\n            develop a NEMP. Second, developing pilot activities will\n            develop innovative models for natural resource management,\n            and increase decentralization of environmental functions.\n            The third component, aiming at building capacity for project\n            management and providing technical training, will strengthen\n            capacity for environmental planning and management in key\n            environmental agencies; ensure efficient and effective\n            project implementation; and develop the needed human\n            resources for the new institutional arrangements
