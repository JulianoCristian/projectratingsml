Ratings for the Social Sector Reform\n            Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for Albania were as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory, risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            high quality of the Bank's analytic work and technical\n            assistance is necessary but not sufficient for\n            effectiveness. Also important are the involvement and buy-in\n            of the government and other key stakeholders and the\n            strategic packaging of support with other Bank products and\n            services. One-tranche DPLs can be transformative and support\n            reform momentum if: (i) build on solid analytic work; (ii)\n            can effectively leverage critical policy change (for\n            example, legislation) that may not gain sufficient traction\n            through sector dialogue alone; and (iii) supported by\n            continuity in the sector policy dialogue and lending after\n            the DPL closes. Political economy is critical to factor into\n            reform design and risk management. Neglect of some aspects\n            of political economy is likely to have undermined prospects\n            for the full and successful implementation of health reforms\n            under the HSMP. The sequencing of reforms under the social\n            assistance DPL and its follow-on implementation support is\n            likely to have mitigated potential implementation setbacks\n            associated with political feasibility, capacity, and fiscal\n            constraints. The design and implementation of pilots to test\n            and fine-tune reforms and the establishment of\n            well-functioning management information system (MIS) and\n            monitoring and evaluation (M and E) systems are critical to\n            health and social assistance reform, as they can accommodate\n            learning, provide evidence of the feasibility and benefits\n            of such reform, and garner political support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Health System Modernization\n            Project and Social Sector Reform Development Policy Loan
