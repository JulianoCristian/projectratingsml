As this is an integral part of a continuing\n            project the risks are considered less than average for\n            irrigation projects of similar size and scope. Cost\n            estimates are firm as they are based on the experience of\n            the on-going project. Projections of yields are conservative\n            and are well within the reach of the average farmer's capability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Periyar Vaigai Irrigation
