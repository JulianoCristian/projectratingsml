The first,\n            development and testing of a groundwater drought management\n            plan for the Limpopo River Basin pilot areas, will test the\n            application and replicability of methods of decreasing the\n            vulnerability of local communities and GDEs to the effects\n            of groundwater droughts, and to ensure that practical\n            on-the-ground benefits accrue to local people from the\n            project.  The second, regional groundwater drought\n            management support, will provide tools for transboundary\n            groundwater management, including hydrogeological maps and\n            maps of groundwater vulnerability and water scarcity.  The\n            third, establishment of the Groundwater Management Institute\n            of Southern Africa (GMISA), will create an institution to\n            increase knowledge of and capacity for groundwater\n            management in SADC, in order to sustain the work of the\n            project and maintain readiness to address future drought\n            events.  The fourth, project management and administration,\n            will provide maximum extemal support to the SADC Water Division."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa Region - Groundwater and Drought\n            Management in the Southern African Development Community\n            (SADC) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa Region -
