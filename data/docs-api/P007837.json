Lessons\n            learned: Although Panama is a country with considerable\n            human resource capacity in both public and private sectors,\n            but Government processes are often bureaucratic, involve\n            multiple layers of control, resulting in slow\n            implementation. The operation was very much designed as a\n            project instead of a more programmatic operation to\n            strengthening the Social Investment Fund (FIS) overall. From\n            the outset, the Bank was aware of the relatively weak\n            management of FIS, and tried to support it through studies\n            and other technical assistance. Despite major investment in\n            improving the existing MIS, the system was not able to\n            operate as expected. Under the education project, there was\n            an explicit agreement with the Ministry of Education that\n            FIS would implement the infrastructure construction program,\n            based on their targeting formula. Although Panama has a\n            well-developed commercial banking system, this does not\n            automatically mean expertise in micro-credit. It took longer\n            than projected to design the operational manual and action\n            plan to implement this important component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Social Investment Fund Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Social Investment Fund Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6085093/panama-social-investment-fund-project","projn":"PA-Social Investment Project -- P007837","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Panama","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20050722102235"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"General education sector,Roads and highways,Other social services,Health,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Education,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"auditing, audits, beneficiaries, capacity\n            building, CAS, collaboration, commercial banks, communities,\n            community capacity, community capacity building, community\n            demand, community infrastructure, community involvement,\n            community organization, community participation,\n            contractors, Currency Unit, data analysis, data systems,\n            decision making, decision-making, economic recession,\n            education, eligibility criteria, employment, evaluation\n            activities, evaluation results, Exchange Rate, expenditure\n            information, external factors, health, Human Development,\n            ICR, IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT, Implementation Plan,\n            implementing agency, increased emphasis, information\n            systems, infrastructure projects, innovation, institutional\n            changes, Institutional Development, Intermediaries,\n            international consultant, Intervention, learning, Lessons\n            Learned, Living Standards, Living Standards Measurement,\n            local governments, M&E activities, malnutrition,\n            managers, mothers, NGO, nutrition, parents, participatory\n            planning, per capita income, performance indicators,\n            political support, poor children, poor communities,\n            population groups, poverty alleviation, poverty impact,\n            Poverty Level, poverty levels, poverty map, poverty\n            reduction, poverty reduction strategy, poverty targeting,\n            primary school, primary schools, private firms, Private\n            Sector, procurement, program implementation, programs,\n            Project Appraisal, project impact evaluation, Project\n            Implementation, Project Management, project monitoring,\n            project preparation, public sector, recurrent costs, rural\n            electrification, rural poverty, social expenditures, social\n            funds, social infrastructure, social policy, social\n            services, targeting, teachers, technical assistance,\n            technical quality, technical support, training programs,\n            vulnerable groups, water supply"}},"owner":"Social Protection Sector (LCSHS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF026763-PHRD-PANAMA: SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND PROJECT,TF029371-PHRD - EMERGENCY SOCIAL FUND PROJECT,TF033749-LAC REGION - SOCIAL INVESTMENT,TF034191-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF034788-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF035192-PANAMA - FES (SOCIAL SECTORS),TF035301-PANAMA - RURAL HEALTH &\n            EMERGENCY SOCIAL FUND (FES),TF035894-CENTRAL AMERICAN REGION -\n            SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF036082-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF036095-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF036156-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF036157-GUATEMALA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF036159-LAC REGION - SOCIAL SECTORS\n            (HONDURAS, PANAMA ),TF036543-LAC REGION - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUNDS,TF036730-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF036733-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF036761-PANAMA - FES (SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND),TF036774-PANAMA - FES - SOCIAL\n            INVESTMENT FUND,TF036775-PANAMA - FES - SOCIAL\n            INVESTMENT FUND,TF037254-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF037445-PANAMA - FES,TF037468-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND, FES,TF037666-PANAMA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND, FES,TF037903-HONDURAS - FHIS IV SOCIAL\n            INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT,TF038148-PANAMA SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND (FES),TF039029-PANAMA - SOC.
