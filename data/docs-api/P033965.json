Ratings for the\n            Environmental and Privatization Support Adjustment Loan\n            (EPSAL) Project for Bulgaria are as follows: outcome was\n            satisfactory; risk to the development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            projects included: a development policy loan supporting\n            privatization with environmental remediation should include\n            strong measures by the Government to monitor and reward\n            compliance (or punish non-compliance) to ensure that\n            remediation and compliance plans are completed on schedule.\n            In the EPSAL, even though all of the policy conditions were\n            met and the remediation plan's (RPs) were signed, the\n            achievements in terms of implementation of the plans, along\n            with their environmental results, were mixed. Even in\n            well-prepared environmental impact assessments (EIAs), it is\n            difficult to include sufficient detail in the technical\n            specifications of remediation investments. Modifications in\n            design and re-negotiations during implementation should be\n            anticipated, and possibly reflected in a longer project\n            implementation period and higher than normal contingency\n            funds. Even when the state assumes responsibility for\n            remediating past environmental damages of state-owned\n            enterprises (SOEs), setting a cap on the state's\n            liability creates risk for potential investors and delays\n            during re-negotiations. The possibility of letting the state\n            assume more of the risk for additional remediation costs\n            should be considered."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Environmental Remediation

Negative impacts and mitigations\n            are listed here: (1) Operate the smelter with a consistent\n            throughput of higher grade copper concentrate to reduce\n            sulfur dioxide emissions, low-level fugitive emissions, and\n            dust. At the same time modify or replace gas cleaning\n            equipment. (2) Reduce treated drainage water and runoff plus\n            water from the slag treatment process by (a) modifying the\n            existing neutralization plant; (a) installing more equipment\n            to produce a solid residue to be deposited safely in lined\n            trenches; (c) later upgrading the plant to a double stage\n            treatment process employing the best technique for treating\n            effluents; and (d) finally, optimizing the smelter operation\n            to reduce the volume of acidic effluent requiring treatment.\n            (3) Wastewater treatment sludge will be stored in a suitably\n            designed lagoon; the fayalite tailings pond, from which dust\n            emissions are blown, will be doubly protected with plastic\n            and a thick soil cover; an old slag dump will be covered to\n            prevent contaminating the sub-surface; and the variety of\n            waste materials, disused equipment, and derelict structures\n            contributing to ground and groundwater contamination will be\n            deposited in the slime pond."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Environmental Liability Pilot\n            Project : environmental impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Environmental\n            Liability Pilot Project : environmental impact assessment\n            (Vol. 2)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/08/3547913/bulgaria-environmental-liability-pilot-project-environmental-impact-assessment-vol-2","projn":"BG-Environmental Remediation Pilot Project\n            -- P033965","subtopic":"Social Funds and Pensions,Knowledge Economy,Information Technology,Education for the Knowledge Economy,Geographical Information Systems","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Education,Information and Communication Technologies,Social Protections and Labor,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Bulgaria","authors":{"authr":"Hatch Associates Limited"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000112742_20040519162334"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Information and Communication Technologies,Social Protections and Labor,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"COMPRESSIOn,EM,I O,Ia,Liability,roM,SLOPE,UNION"},"1":{"cdata!":"COMPRESSIOn,EM,I O,Ia,Liability,roM,SLOPE,UNION"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF037812-BULGARIA - ENVIRONMENTAL\n            REMEDIATION PILOT,TF037732-BULGARIA - ENV.
