More specifically, the\n            project aims to: 1) develop sector strategies for social\n            sectors, especially health and education; 2) build capacity\n            in the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and\n            planning bureaus/units of line ministries to develop\n            concepts and strategies, plan, monitor and evaluate sector\n            performance and programs; and 3) build capacity of\n            provincial staff - Bappedas (Provincial Development Planning\n            Agency), provincial line ministries (Kanwil), and the local\n            government technical office (Dinas) - to design, prepare,\n            implement, monitor and evaluate programs. In addition, the\n            project will support provincial efforts to determine sector\n            priorities and prepare investment plans, and support project\n            design and feasibility studies as well as pilot projects.\n            The project will provide support to BAPPENAS, line\n            ministries (especially health and education) and the\n            provinces. Support the BAPPENAS will include the following\n            activities: 1) sector analysis and studies; 2) development\n            of decentralization strategies; 3) review of planning\n            frameworks; 4) assessment of staff skills and training\n            needs; 5) on-the-job-training of staff; and 6) development\n            of training programs for social sectors planning and\n            pre-feasibility studies. Support to line ministries will\n            assist the planning units in the selected line ministries\n            (health, education and culture, religious affairs and social\n            affairs) to define and operationalize their sector\n            strategies (covering public-private delivery and targeting\n            public interventions) and to carry out selected sector\n            studies. This component will also include the following: 1)\n            provisions to review and improve monitoring and evaluation\n            systems and capacities; 2) support for selective training\n            programs to strengthen the capacity of these units and for\n            carrying out a small number of pilot studies and feasibility\n            studies. Finally, the support for provinces will consist of:\n            1) an intensified support for training, sector analysis, and\n            preparation of investment plan in about five provinces\n            selected according to agreed criteria;
