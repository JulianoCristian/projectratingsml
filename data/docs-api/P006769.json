covering about 47,000 ha, including about\n            11,300 ha of newly equipped land. Maintenance would be\n            improved and obsolete equipment for operation and\n            maintenance would be replaced. Technical assistance would be\n            provided to small farmers and lands in rice districts would\n            be leveled to save water reduce production costs and\n            increase cropping intensity. The project would also\n            strengthen HIMAT's (Instituto Colombiano de Hidrologia,\n            Meteorologia y Adecuacion de Tierras - Colombian Institute\n            for Hydrology, Meteorology and Land Improvement) capacity to\n            appraise and supervise irrigation/drainage projects and\n            train beneficiaries to manage their own irrigation systems.\n            It is expected that the project would benefit about 4,700\n            farm families, including nearly 1,500 land reform\n            beneficiaries. The major risk is that beneficiaries would be\n            reluctant to adopt technological changes including land\n            leveling, thus delaying or reducing project benefits. This\n            risk, however, is relatively small, and training, technical\n            assistance, access to credit and increased water charges are\n            all expected to encourage farmers to adopt improved farming\n            and irrigation practices."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Proyecto Rehabilitacion de Riego"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia: Proyecto de\n            Rehabilitaci\u00f3n del Riego : Colombia - Proyecto\n            Rehabilitaci\u00f3n de Riego"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/04/11969787/colombia-irrigation-rehabilitation-project-colombia-proyecto-rehabilitacion-de-riego","projn":"CO-Irrigation Rehab I -- P006769","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies,Drylands & Desertification,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Agricultural Research","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Agriculture,Environment","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20100319025709"},"subsc":"Irrigation and drainage","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Agriculture,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Animal production; Basin irrigation;\n            Cultivation; Cultivation systems; Drainage systems;\n            Irrigation systems; Rice,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Animal production; Basin irrigation;\n            Cultivation; Cultivation systems; Drainage systems;\n            Irrigation systems; Rice,,"}},"owner":"LCR Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"3356","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Proyecto Rehabilitacion de Riego"}}},"facets":{}}}
