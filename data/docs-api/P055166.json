Some lessons learned included: 1) a\n            social fund is a very efficient mechanism to build the\n            capacity of communities; 2) benefits of social funds will be\n            considerably increased if their design allows them to be\n            innovative and flexible in order to adapt to changing\n            country circumstances and meet urgent needs; 3) it is in the\n            interest of development partners such as the World Bank to\n            continue to support well-performing and flexible social\n            funds as they can be an efficient mechanism to finance, at\n            short notice, responses to emergencies or additional\n            activities to benefit vulnerable groups, including\n            cash-for-work programs and other kinds of cash transfers; 4)\n            compliance with national sector policy and strategy, as well\n            as strong coordination with sector ministries, lead to\n            better synergy and improvement of quality of investment and\n            better sustainability of infrastructure built; and 5) demand\n            driven programs can run the risk that the most able\n            communities will fare the best, and social funds need to\n            find ways of working effectively with the most vulnerable communities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar - Community Development
