Ratings for the Community Development Support\n            Project were as follows: outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was significant; Bank performance was\n            highly unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            highly unsatisfactory. Some of the lessons learned include:\n            a successful construction program does not necessarily mean\n            a successful development program. Attention is needed to the\n            full objectives of a project, including \"software\"\n            as well as \"hardware.\" LHWP- 1B's successful\n            water infrastructure program will be a main pillar in\n            Lesotho's development program for decades to come. But\n            the royalties did not go to poverty reduction, the\n            project's most fundamental objective. Also, while\n            LHWP-1B was strong in all aspects related directly to\n            construction (engineering, physical works and water\n            delivery), it performed weakly in software aspects (capacity\n            building, training and resettlement). Lesotho and South\n            Africa's \"good practice\" water treaty has\n            features that may be relevant elsewhere. The following\n            features have contributed to success: (i) clarity and detail\n            in the treaty document, including procedures for adjusting\n            to changing circumstances; (ii) appropriate institutions - a\n            bridging institution has worked well in coordinating actions\n            between the two countries; (iii) focused objectives; and\n            (iv) independent dispute resolution mechanisms within the\n            institutions themselves. The Bank's 20-year engagement\n            providing technical and policy support, and as a motivator\n            for the financial involvement of other lenders, also\n            contributed to the treaty's success. Safeguards\n            implementation should not be given second-tier priority, but\n            should receive the same attention as the main project\n            components. Successful implementation of a safeguard program\n            requires the same design and supervision qualities as other\n            project components."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Phase 1B of the Highlands Water\n            Project, and Community Development Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho -

Among the lessons learned were the\n            following:  Without Government commitment, a small amount of\n            money will not leverage a much larger amount of money.\n            Aligning key Project documents is important; failure to\n            harmonize the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) and the\n            Development Credit Agreement (DCA) can lead to confusion\n            during implementation and completion. Appropriate measures\n            need to be taken, including the provision of necessary\n            resources, as soon as deficits (such as failure to adhere to\n            the Operational Manual) are identified, or once attainment\n            of the development objectives became questionable.

Support for\n            poverty monitoring may not be best placed in Community\n            Demand-Driven (CDD) operations.

There are three project components.\n            The first supports the establishment and implementation of\n            the Lesotho Fund for Community Development (LFCD) by\n            pre-testing LFCD operations and procedures in sub-projects\n            in 22 pilot communities; setting up a basic set of\n            operational and financial systems including an accounting\n            and management information system; and financing all\n            recurrent operational costs. The second component trains\n            staff to build the capacity of LFCD and provides technical\n            support to LFCD partner institutions such as community-based\n            organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private\n            sector firms. The third component strengthens the\n            capabilities of the Bureau of Statistics to collect,\n            process, analyze, and disseminate data for poverty\n            monitoring; and strengthens the quality of program\n            monitoring and poverty analysis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Community Development Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho -
