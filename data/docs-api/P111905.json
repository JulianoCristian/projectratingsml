Some lessons learned included:\n            policy reforms are implemented and therefore driven by the\n            middle level government officials across the range of\n            ministries. Reforms should therefore incorporate the\n            tactical and political sense of these key government\n            counterparts when designing the pace and scope of a program.\n            Where consensus is uncertain, a deliberation process along\n            with modest expectations should be established up front to\n            allow policy options to be explored and breakthroughs to\n            emerge. To support such a process, constant dialogue between\n            the Government and the Bank is fundamental and is best\n            facilitated by a strong field presence across a wide range\n            of sectors which views policy discussions as a natural part\n            of ongoing support. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            system for IDPL lacked in places, quantitative indicators,\n            baseline data, strong targets and a system for monitoring\n            and recalibration of variables. For the system to be a\n            useful management tool for Government, it is important for\n            outcomes to be monitored and attributed to design and\n            implementation issues, so that the latter can receive\n            attention. For this to occur, integration of the M&E\n            framework with the results framework is needed so: (i)\n            objectives are explicitly stated, (ii) associated outcomes\n            are targeted with numerical indicators, (iii) policy actions\n            are specified which will credibly influence the targeted\n            indicators, and (iv) on-going calibration of policy changes,\n            external changes and targeted indicators are carried out as\n            part of Government functions to support implementation of a\n            multi-year, multi-sector program of the complexity of the\n            IDPL series."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Infrastructure Development Policy Loans

Infrastructure\n            Development Policy Loan (IDPL) series has rapidly assumed\n            central importance in the dialogue between the Government of\n            Indonesia and the World Bank concerning the\n            Government's infrastructure reform program. The program\n            is built around four areas of engagement: national\n            infrastructure (e.g. electricity and roads); subnational\n            infrastructure (e.g. water); public-private partnerships;\n            and cross-cutting governance issues including land\n            acquisition, environment, and procurement. The common theme\n            in each of these areas is to increase the amount and\n            effectiveness of infrastructure spending, in order to\n            contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. The\n            program is primarily grounded in areas of influence of\n            central ministries - the Ministry of Finance, the\n            Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, and Bappenas\n            (the planning ministry). For national infrastructure, the\n            emphasis is on increasing the level of government investment\n            and improving planning and budgeting processes to improve\n            the effectiveness of government spending. For sub-national\n            infrastructure, the reforms are centered on\n            intergovernmental fiscal relations and the incentives for\n            sub-national governments to deliver infrastructure services.\n            For public-private partnerships the emphasis is on\n            establishing a policy framework, institutions, and financing\n            mechanisms to encourage greater private sector interest in\n            Indonesia's infrastructure. And finally, in the\n            cross-cutting governance areas, which typically fall outside\n            the direct influence of the central ministries, the approach\n            taken is either to build on the relevant line\n            ministries' existing reform programs, or to develop\n            progressively greater engagement with these ministries\n            commencing with development of their own action plans for reform."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Second Infrastructure\n            Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Second
