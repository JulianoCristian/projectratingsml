The assessment rates\n            sustainability as likely, and institutional development\n            impact as substantial; it rates Bank performance as\n            satisfactory and borrower performance also satisfactory. The\n            key lessons from the project are as follows: Good\n            preparation is important, but must allow for a realistic\n            time frame. For policy/institutional restructuring projects,\n            it should set out the broad study direction and assist the\n            borrower to take full ownership of the process, which should\n            be fine-tuned as the project proceeds, with full input from\n            the key sector players. The project preparation plan should\n            include an assessment of possible risks. In the event that\n            the project experiences internal and/or external shocks\n            necessitating institutional restructuring, such\n            restructuring can best be expedited

The key lessons\n            learned from the project implementation include: 1) The\n            promptness of IDA's response to the devastating effects\n            of Hurricane Mitch as instrumental in preserving the\n            benefits of the project. IDA's continued assistance\n            helped the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing\n            (SOPTRAVI) in keeping a long-term view while attending to\n            the reconstruction effort, as illustrated by the\n            incorporation of strategic lessons learned from Hurricane\n            Mitch and the implementation of long-term reforms to enhance\n            road maintenance sustainability. 2) Project implementation\n            shows that the engagement of a private consulting firm,\n            composed mainly of engineers who were formerly employed by\n            SOPTRAVI, facilitated project coordination and enabled the\n            provision of high-quality technical support. 3) The project,\n            with its strong emphasis on sector-wide reforms, implied a\n            departure from previous operations in the sector. Taking\n            advantage of the window opportunity, the project contributed\n            to carrying the reform message through two administrations,\n            albeit with varying degrees of success among sub-sectors.\n            The outcome proved successful in the aviation and road sub-sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Transport Sector Rehabilitation
