Some lessons learned\n            included: hydropower studies are notorious for cost\n            overruns, most notably because the geology on the dam site\n            is typically not fully known at project start. Therefore,\n            contingency funds for additional studies should be ample or\n            a strategy for expedient allocation of additional funding\n            should be identified during project preparation. Undertaking\n            a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is prudent policy\n            whenever new power generation is contemplated and past SEAs\n            are non-existent or dated. Undertaking a SEA was originally\n            not part of the Project's hydropower component, and the\n            Government was originally of the opinion that sufficient\n            studies of this nature had been made. In retrospect, the\n            Bank's team concluded that a SEA should have been\n            incorporated in the project's initial plans. The\n            Government agreed during project implementation to undertake\n            a SEA; however, since available International Development\n            Association (IDA) funds at a critical point in time seemed\n            inadequate to also finance such study, the development of\n            the SEA was ultimately managed by the Bank and financed over\n            the Bank's supervision budget. Allocation of sufficient\n            resources and time for preparation of feasibility studies\n            and designs is essential. Only 6 months were given for the\n            designs, when about 12 months will have been more\n            appropriate and the budget allocated for the designs was\n            only at about 1.5 percent of the construction costs, when\n            usually about 5 percent is allocated for projects of similar\n            size and complexity, The Bank should intervene in cases when\n            the budget allocation seems insufficient for good quality\n            outputs, or when the delivery is too rushed. When a line\n            ministry is in charge of the contract management/supervision\n            of consultancy assignment; a lump-sum contract, as opposed\n            to a time-based contract seems to be more effective. The\n            line ministries sometimes have constrained resources for the\n            supervision and monitoring of the time based contract which\n            requires close monitoring of staff-days worked and\n            processing monthly payments. Linking payments to the\n            consultant to the specific deliverables/outputs will ease\n            the pressure on the line ministry and make implementation of\n            the consultancy assignment more effective. The projects\n            which envisage work s located near areas of potential\n            military activities or areas which are not fully under the\n            Government control should build into the project design\n            mitigation measure for the potential implementation delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Infrastructure Pre-Investment\n            Facility

The IPF comprises two components: 1) TA for\n            Khudoni Hydropower project (HPP) preparation, to assess its\n            technical, economic and financial viability, and to\n            determine how the hydropower project development would\n            proceed in compliance with appropriate environmental and\n            social safeguards, prioritizing on Dam safety. Should the\n            Khudoni HPP prove to be economically attractive (and\n            otherwise feasible), financial analyses would be undertaken,\n            and issues addressed concerning ownership and power sales.\n            2) TA for the preparation of transit corridor projects\n            entails two subcomponents: a) TA for the preparation of the\n            East- West Highway improvement, seeks to complete a\n            feasibility study, preliminary design, and environmental\n            assessment to upgrade the road from Natakhtari to Agaiani;\n            b) TA for the preparation of other transit corridor projects\n            shall be determined, dependent upon the availability of\n            remaining funds, following satisfactory results of the above\n            mentioned priority project components.
