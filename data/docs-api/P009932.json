Some lessons learned included: TINP I had a\n            marked impact on the prevalence of severe malnutrition in\n            Tamil Nadu during the 1980s, as borne out by an impact\n            evaluation, and later corroborated by the National Family\n            Health Survey (NFHS). This success was founded on several\n            factors including selective feeding, favorable\n            worker-supervisor ratios, clear job descriptions and a\n            well-focused monitoring system, used to improve project\n            management and implementation. Community ownership should\n            remain a priority, requiring an involvement of more people\n            in more direct nutrition-improving action, in addition to\n            resource contributions by panchayats community\n            self-monitoring is just one example, where by a core set of\n            key indicators could be tracked by community organizations\n            to increase the visibility of progress. Particular attention\n            needs to be paid to reaching the youngest children who are\n            at greatest risk. With regard to area-targeting, many remote\n            hamlets, with high proportions of scheduled caste groups,\n            still need to be reached through the establishment of\n            mini-Community Nutrition Center (CNC). The phenomenon of\n            lagging districts, particularly in the north of the state,\n            has been known for sometime. The recommendation of\n            supervision missions of joint action-planning with district\n            staff and block-level problem mapping is still valid."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Tamil Nadu Integrated\n            Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second Tamil Nadu\n            Integrated Nutrition Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/04/731727/india-second-tamil-nadu-integrated-nutrition-project","projn":"IN-Second Tn Nutrition -- P009932","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Early Child and Children's Health,Nutrition,Primary Education,Early Childhood Development","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980630180543"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Education","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aged,Antenatal\n            care,breastfeeding,caregivers,Child Development,child\n            feeding,child malnutrition,child morbidity,child nutritional\n            status,Child Survival,Child Welfare,childhood\n            malnutrition,Community Nutrition Workers,complementary\n            feeding,complementary foods,diarrhea,early childhood,Family\n            Health,folic acid,food supplementation,gender,girls,group\n            dynamics,growth monitoring,growth promotion,health\n            education,health services,health status,health status of\n            children,home visits,immunization,IMR,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rate,iron,LBW,Learning,live\n            births,Low Birth Weight,malnourished\n            children,malnutrition,mass media,maternal\n            nutrition,micronutrient supplementation,moderate\n            malnutrition,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,motivation,needs\n            assessment,Nutrition,nutrition education,nutrition\n            improvement,Nutrition interventions,Nutrition\n            Monitoring,nutrition programs,nutrition projects,nutritional\n            status,old children,Participatory Rapid Appraisal,pre-school\n            education,pregnancy,pregnant women,respiratorY\n            infections,Rural Areas,Safe Motherhood,severe\n            malnutrition,skills training,sugar,supplementary\n            feeding,technical assistance,Tetanus,Vitamin A,vitamin A supplementation,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"aged,Antenatal\n            care,breastfeeding,caregivers,Child Development,child\n            feeding,child malnutrition,child morbidity,child nutritional\n            status,Child Survival,Child Welfare,childhood\n            malnutrition,Community Nutrition Workers,complementary\n            feeding,complementary foods,diarrhea,early childhood,Family\n            Health,folic acid,food supplementation,gender,girls,group\n            dynamics,growth monitoring,growth promotion,health\n            education,health services,health status,health status of\n            children,home visits,immunization,IMR,Infant\n            Mortality,Infant Mortality Rate,iron,LBW,Learning,live\n            births,Low Birth Weight,malnourished\n            children,malnutrition,mass media,maternal\n            nutrition,micronutrient supplementation,moderate\n            malnutrition,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,motivation,needs\n            assessment,Nutrition,nutrition education,nutrition\n            improvement,Nutrition interventions,Nutrition\n            Monitoring,nutrition programs,nutrition projects,nutritional\n            status,old children,Participatory Rapid Appraisal,pre-school\n            education,pregnancy,pregnant women,respiratorY\n            infections,Rural Areas,Safe Motherhood,severe\n            malnutrition,skills training,sugar,supplementary\n            feeding,technical assistance,Tetanus,Vitamin A,vitamin A supplementation,workers"}},"owner":"S.A.
