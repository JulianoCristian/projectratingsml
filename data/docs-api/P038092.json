Likewise, the\n            close link, of the privatization agency with government\n            authorities, enabled forecasting problems, which could thus\n            be solved in a timely manner. The numerous supervision\n            missions, provided not only, the support needed to execute\n            the project as per loan covenants, but the flexibility to\n            adjust during implementation, to changes in line with\n            project objectives. Both the Bank, and the Borrower were\n            sensitive of the complex socio-political environment of the\n            country, which enabled the right dialogue among technical\n            coordinators, to attain high commitment to project\n            implementation.
