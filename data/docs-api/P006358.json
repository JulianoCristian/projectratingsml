According to\n            the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and the Loan Agreement\n            (LA), project objectives were the financial rehabilitation\n            and improved commercial performance of the Federal Railway\n            System; and increased transport efficiency in the two export\n            corridors of Parand and Goias- Minas Gerais.
