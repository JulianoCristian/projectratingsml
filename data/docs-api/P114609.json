The Bank received\n            a moderately satisfactory performance rating while the\n            Borrower\u0092s performance was rated satisfactory. There were\n            two restructurings that took place during this project. The\n            first restructuring moved a school feeding program into\n            community grants disbursement category; added six districts\n            to the program and reallocated funds. The second\n            restructuring replaced the wording school feeding with\n            school meals; extend closing date; modified the results\n            framework and adjusted indicator targets; and reallocated\n            funds. The following lessons were learned from this project:\n            (1) Decentralization of school construction to remote rural\n            communities increases ownership and commitment to education.\n            (2) Mainstreaming implementation within government agencies\n            requires ongoing capacity building. (3)\n            Well-defined/well-targeted pilot activities can have a large\n            impact when providing governments with tangible evidence.\n            (4) Inclusion of analytical studies as part of project\n            design is essential for providing guidance to decision\n            makers on systemic reforms. (5) Strong financial management\n            systems are critical for ensuring the efficient use and\n            accounting of resources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao PDR - Catalytic Fund EFA/FTI
