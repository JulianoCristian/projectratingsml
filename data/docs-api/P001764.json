The following are\n            lessons of experience from implementation of these projects.\n            The objectives of short-term emergency assistance, and\n            medium to long-term institutional development and policy\n            assistance, are sufficiently different that they should be\n            treated in separate operations. The benefits of energy\n            sector reform need to be clearly explained to\n            decision-makers, managers of energy companies, opinion\n            leaders, and the population as a whole, in order to build\n            their ownership and support. Care must be given to adapt the\n            scale and complexity of projects, to ensure that the\n            borrower has the capacity to both manage the projects, and\n            absorb the information, and lessons that are derived from\n            them. Bank supervision teams need to have the necessary\n            range of expertise to deal effectiveIy with the major\n            project components, such as power sector, and biomass energy\n            components. Moving a country from a traditional fuel-based\n            energy system, to one that provides modern energy services\n            to a significant portion of the population, requires a\n            long-term strategy that goes beyond the specifics of any one project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -
