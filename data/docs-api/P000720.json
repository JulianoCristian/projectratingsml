To achieve these\n            objectives, the program would assist three key sectors:\n            agriculture, transportation, and water supply.\n            Specifically, the proposed program would fund 50,000 tons of\n            fertilizer and US$2.0 million worth of plant protection\n            chemicals and the same value of veterinary drugs and\n            equipment for boosting 1985 agricultural production by\n            peasant farmers.

Furthermore, the program would\n            fund water pumps, motors and generators to repair about 170\n            mechanized and 800 hand-operated wells and boreholes in the\n            drought
