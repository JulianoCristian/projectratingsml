Some lessons learned included:\n            based on the experience gained from this project as well as\n            from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) project, and the European Bank\n            for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) project, the\n            project level transaction costs are still high and clients\n            require considerable pre-investment Technical Assistance\n            (TA) support (feasibility studies, structuring finance and\n            finding attractive financing, etc.) before large scale\n            Energy Efficiency (EE) implementation is possible. Local\n            knowledge and skills contribute to success more cost\n            effectively. A strong and reliable pipeline of initial\n            projects is essential to ensure early success of this type\n            of project. The original fund manager contract structure\n            should have been weighted more towards performance instead\n            of retainer part, adding flexibility in the contract\n            structure to adjust the fixed and performance fee would be\n            desirable and avoids costly repeat procurement, knowledge of\n            local industry and market is very important to ensure\n            success. For small demonstration projects such as this one,\n            the institutional design of Romanian Energy Efficiency Fund\n            (FREE) was overly complex, but at the same time, the\n            fiduciary controls and checks and balances are attractive\n            features for scaling up with both public and private capital."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Energy Efficiency

Efficiency Fund (FREE) and co-financiers.\n            This would put the economy on a sustainable path of lower\n            energy intensity, and greenhouse gas emissions. The\n            investment financing component will support the\n            establishment, and operation of an Energy Efficiency\n            Development and Financing Facility, which will be operated\n            under the Free Fund, set as an independent, autonomous legal\n            entity, in a public-private partnership, with GEF funds used\n            to capitalize the Fund, and partially defray initial\n            transaction costs. The project is designed to attract\n            substantial amount of commercial co-financing, and will\n            allow for both parallel, and direct co-financing\n            arrangements. Initially, the Fund will focus primarily on\n            financing projects within restructured, and/or privatized\n            industries, based on established creditworthiness, and on\n            minimal risk, and maximum potential criteria. Other types of\n            financing will include equipment leasing, payment for\n            services, and financial products which the evolving market\n            demands. The technical assistance (TA) component will cover\n            three broad areas: 1) capacity building activities on\n            initial project development, workshops and seminars for\n            partners, and training Fund Managers in energy efficiency\n            financing; 2) Fund management activities, which includes\n            retainer fees of the Fund Manager for the first three year;\n            and, 3) FREE administration activities, to include its\n            set-up and running costs during the first four years. Donor\n            support for TA will likely come in the form of tied, or\n            in-kind contributions for capacity building activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Romania - Energy Efficiency
