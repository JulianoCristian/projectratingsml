Project sustainability is highly likely.\n            Similarly, both World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            highly satisfactory. Key lessons learned were: Quality staff\n            with a clear mandate, sufficient autonomy, and authority is\n            critical to implementing reform programs, particularly\n            privatization of state-owned enterprises. To succeed, the\n            reforms have to be not only economically but also\n            politically sustainable. The privatization process should be\n            transparent with continuous education of the public. For\n            privatization to lead to greater competition, the regulatory\n            framework must be transparent prior to the divestiture\n            process. Bolivia's capitalization process where the\n            capitalization's sales money is invested in the\n            enterprise might be worth duplicating in other
