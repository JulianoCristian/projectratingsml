The main lessons are: 1) Tunisia's\n            successful economic performance has been due to three\n            attributes: ownership and broad political consensus, a\n            well-developed human resource base, and a stable\n            macroeconomic environment. 2)  Experience in privatization\n            and the financial sector shows the need for the Bank and the\n            development partners to stay the course and show flexibility\n            in their support, provided there is evidence of genuine and\n            sustained reform efforts. For example, by accepting partial\n            reforms in some areas, and building on partial successes to\n            deepen them in subsequent operations, the support from the\n            Bank and other partners was ultimately effective. Patience,\n            perseverance and flexibility paid off. 3) An important\n            lesson for other small emerging countries seeking to lay the\n            foundations for sustainable growth and poverty reduction is\n            the success of Tunisia in creating a competitive economy by\n            the coordinated use o f macro and structural policies and reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Economic Competitiveness\n            Adjustment Loan, Second Economic Competitiveness Adjustment\n            Loan and Third Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Economic\n            Competitiveness Adjustment Loan, Second Economic\n            Competitiveness Adjustment Loan and Third Economic\n            Competitiveness Adjustment Loan Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/12/5541621/tunisia-economic-competitiveness-adjustment-loan-second-economic-competitiveness-adjustment-loan-third-economic-competitiveness-adjustment-loan-projects","projn":"TN-Third Economic Competitiveness Adjustment\n            Loan -- P055815,TN-Ecal I -- P042287,TN-Ecal II -- P053255","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Economic Stabilization,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Achieving Shared Growth,Macroeconomic Management","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050111151717"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Non-compulsory pensions and insurance,General finance sector,Capital markets,Banking,Telecommunications,Ports, waterways and shipping,Other social services,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance,Information and communications,Transportation,Health and other social services,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Economic competitiveness; Economic\n            performance; Human resources development; Political\n            consensus; Macroeconomic stability; Structural reforms"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduct & Econ.

Both the\n            and Borrower performances are regarded as satisfactory. ECAL\n            II incorporated the lessons of ECAL I by focusing narrowly\n            on upgrading the performance of the financial sector and\n            specifically the banking sector. Given the importance of the\n            banking system in the Tunisian financial sector, it was\n            correctly chosen as the principal target of reforms. An\n            extensive reform package for the insurance sector was not\n            included under this loan because although necessary, the\n            reforms could not have been effectively implemented during\n            the ECAL II timeframe. Instead, preparatory work for\n            insurance sector reforms was done during ECAL II, and the\n            reform measures have been included as part of ECAL III. The\n            series of ECAL adjustment operations in Tunisia have\n            demonstrated the value of appropriately targeted and\n            sequenced reform measures in the long-term development of a\n            country's economy. One particular weakness in ECAL II\n            also provides an important lesson: it is crucial to obtain a\n            firm, binding commitment from all parties having decision\n            authority over actions targeted by the operation. The\n            privatization of the merged bank was included as a condition\n            for the release of the second tranche. Given that the\n            Borrower did not have exclusive control of the merger\n            decision, this measure should not have been included."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Economic Competitiveness\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia -
