However, the\n            Ministry of Finance, subsequent to negotiations, questioned\n            the condition in the Guarantee Agreement that required the\n            Guarantor to cause the Energy Regulatory Board, to adjust\n            heat tariffs on a regular basis, in order to allow the\n            Borrower to recover appropriate costs, and remain\n            competitive with other heating alternatives. Key concern was\n            the uncertainty of disconnections from the District Heating\n            (DH) system, in light of changes in the Energy Law, and\n            removal of restrictions to install alternative heating\n            systems, as well as concerns about the collateral to be\n            provided by Rigas Siltums to back up the guarantee, and\n            uncertainty over tariffs, and prices of alternative fuels.\n            Given these risks, the Ministry of Finance could not issue a\n            state guarantee, and, did not include the Project in the\n            guarantee limit of the State Budget Law for 2001, nor for\n            2002. Although the Bank is continuing specific energy market\n            liberalization, and related gas and DH regulatory issues\n            under a structural adjustment operation, the loans for RDHP\n            have been withdrawn at the request of the Guarantor."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia -
