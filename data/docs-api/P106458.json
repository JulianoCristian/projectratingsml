Some lessons learned included: in post\n            conflict situations, the reform agenda should be sharply\n            focused and well sequenced and technical assistance should\n            be available to support the implementation of reforms. A\n            development policy operation is an effective instrument for\n            addressing key issues critical for restoring a functional\n            government. It contributes to setting the stage for\n            medium-term reforms, and facilitates donor coordination.\n            Technical assistance should be available to help the\n            Government implement the reform program and build up\n            capacity in key areas for improving government\n            effectiveness. Funding for technical assistance should be\n            readily available. A close dialogue should be maintained at\n            all times, through frequent supervision missions, field\n            presence and use of videoconferences. Donors should work\n            closely together and, if at all possible, use the same\n            instruments. The policy matrix developed for EMGRG was used\n            by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Bank. Other\n            donors provided timely technical assistance to ensure\n            implementation of the program. The general framework for\n            budget support to the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            (PRSP) (CGAB-DSRP) agreed recently between the Government\n            and donors operating in CAR will help improve the\n            predictability of aid and facilitate the administration of\n            donor support. After a long period of economic mismanagement\n            and internal conflicts, the priority is to restore the basic\n            functions of government. With the return to peace, the\n            population has high expectations that long repressed basic\n            needs will be met. Managing expectations is essential, as\n            resources are extremely limited."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Economic\n            Management and Governance Reform Grant
