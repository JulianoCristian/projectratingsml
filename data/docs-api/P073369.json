These two projects increased access to rural\n            water supply and sanitation in India. Some lessons learned\n            included; improving the quality of rural service delivery to\n            increase access to water supply and sanitation improves\n            environmental health. Given a supportive institutional\n            environment, decentralized, community led water supply and\n            sanitation projects can be both effective and less costly at\n            providing new rural infrastructure. Government line agencies\n            that have traditionally delivered services through a\n            centralized, government-led approach face challenges in\n            supporting decentralized, community led rural water supply\n            and sanitation approaches. The limited availability of\n            experienced Non-government Organization (NGOs) capacity to\n            facilitate community capacity building can constrain\n            adoption of the community-led approach for rural water and\n            sanitation service delivery. And there is a role for public\n            or private support agencies to provide much-needed expertise\n            and technical support to trouble-shoot community-owned water\n            schemes.

performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the project\n            clearly demonstrated that investing in participatory\n            processes to identify, articulate, and satisfy the demand\n            for Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) services at the level\n            of the Gram Panchayats (GPs) might start slow, as it\n            requires time to develop local capacity and decentralize\n            delivery, but that the process pays off over time. In fact,\n            the project registered a slow disbursement curve during the\n            first two years of implementation and a very fast\n            acceleration over the last three years, once capacities and\n            local systems for service delivery were in place. Initial\n            capacity building is an important activity to prioritize\n            before the formation of local committees. Despite the fact\n            that fully sustainable operation and maintenance of the\n            assets delivered by the project has not yet been achieved\n            across all the target GPs, the project created a basis for\n            future sustainability by introducing the culture of paying\n            for a service. A key lesson emerging from project\n            implementation is that communities can be more effectively\n            mobilized in smaller villages with more cohesive social\n            backgrounds.

for Maharashtra, India will\n            safeguard the tribals' interest in scheduled areas. The\n            tribal development plan will have two major objectives: i)\n            one related to rural water supply and sanitation delivery\n            being attempted through fostering, and empowering\n            autonomous, inclusive, equitable and accountable grassroots\n            tribal institutions, and ii) institutional strengthening to\n            enable the state government in general. The concept of\n            self-help and community sharing or resources is ingrained in\n            the tribal culture; involving local communities in\n            decision-making is part of the tradition. Key issues are\n            discussed and conflicts, if any, are resolved in the\n            presence of hereditary village head and other elders. The\n            project's strategy of decentralization of Village\n            Panchayats, and user groups, fits in with the tribal\n            socio-economic characteristics and cultural value. At the\n            same time, a study on traditional systems of governance\n            among tribals will also be completed during the first year\n            of the project, with a view to identify\n            culturally-appropriate ways of local governance and hence to\n            improve tribals' participation and inclusion. The\n            tribal development strategy will also be premised on the\n            Community Demand Driven (CDD) principles of: autonomy,\n            subsidiary, self selection and demand driven participation,\n            inclusion and equity, transparency and accountability, and\n            cost sharing. Tribals mobilized into groups will be\n            capacitated to plan, implement and operate and maintain the\n            project activities/facilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Maharashtra Rural Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project : indigenous peoples plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Maharashtra Rural Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project : indigenous peoples plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/04/2350347/india-maharashtra-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","projn":"IN-Maharashtra Rural Water Supply And\n            Sanitation \"Jalswarajya\" Pro -- P073369","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03052004071312"},"subsc":"Water supply,Sanitation","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Access to water supply,adverse\n            effects,Beneficiary\n            Assessment,brewing,Certification,decision making,Drinking\n            Water,economic activities,Environmental\n            Sanitation,geographical areas,health status,household\n            income,households,Human Development,income,indigenous\n            peoples,Infant mortality,Irrigation,Irrigation,long\n            term,mortality rate,natural resources,political\n            participation,Population Density,poverty alleviation,poverty\n            level,poverty line,Poverty Profile,qualitative\n            research,Regulatory Framework,research studies,Rural\n            Water,Rural Water Supply,Safe Water,sanitation\n            activities,sanitation facilities,social\n            justice,towns,Water,Water Management,Water Scarcity,water\n            shortages,Water Supplies,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"Access to water supply,adverse\n            effects,Beneficiary\n            Assessment,brewing,Certification,decision making,Drinking\n            Water,economic activities,Environmental\n            Sanitation,geographical areas,health status,household\n            income,households,Human Development,income,indigenous\n            peoples,Infant mortality,Irrigation,Irrigation,long\n            term,mortality rate,natural resources,political\n            participation,Population Density,poverty alleviation,poverty\n            level,poverty line,Poverty Profile,qualitative\n            research,Regulatory Framework,research studies,Rural\n            Water,Rural Water Supply,Safe Water,sanitation\n            activities,sanitation facilities,social\n            justice,towns,Water,Water Management,Water Scarcity,water\n            shortages,Water Supplies,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Agriculture,Irrigation & Nat Res (SASDA)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF051901-PHRD-INDIA: MAHARASHTRA RURAL\n            WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT (RWSS,TF026724-PHRD-INDIA: SECOND MAHARASTRA\n            RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SANI","repnb":"IPP47"},"2352891":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/04/2352891/india-maharashtra-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-1-2-executive-summary","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/04/2352891/india-maharashtra-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-1-2-executive-summary","new_url":"2003/04/2352891/india-maharashtra-rural-water-supply-sanitation-project-environmental-assessment-vol-1-2-executive-summary","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/05/30/000094946_03052104055447/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/05/30/000094946_03052104055447/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","datestored":"2003-05-30T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-04-15T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"2","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India.
