Lessons learned from the project: The\n            availability of accurate baseline data is crucial for\n            assessing the performance of the operator and the importance\n            of such a baseline cannot be emphasized enough. Excluding\n            the operator from managing the capital investment component\n            had a negative impact (through delays) on achieving certain\n            performance targets. When the existing utility operations\n            are relatively weak performance targets should be\n            conservative and should be limited to a handful of the truly\n            central ones. When the private operator is entering a\n            relatively weak environment, the duration of the management\n            contact should be six years and upwards since this is the\n            minimum time to achieve significant improvements in such a\n            weak environment. The effort and time required to reduce\n            unaccounted-for-water/non-revenue water was underestimated.\n            Allowing the prospective bidders to bid on the percentage of\n            the incentive fee was suboptimal and created more risks to\n            the bidders. The credibility of the water supply operations\n            depends on the success in achieving continuous water service\n            in Amman. It is now clear that this will require more time\n            than forecast."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Amman Water and Sanitation\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Amman Water and\n            Sanitation Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/06/7926230/jordan-amman-water-sanitation-management-project","projn":"JO-Amman Water & Sanitation -- P048521","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Systems,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Jordan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20070718100704"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sewerage","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adequate financing, augmentation, bill\n            collection, bulk water, bulk water supply, capacity\n            building, cash flow, Central government, Competitive\n            Bidding, contract period, covering, distribution system,\n            environmental health, equitable access, financial viability,\n            fixed fee, groundwater, Investment Program, Irrigation,\n            joint venture, leak detection, leakage, management of water,\n            metering, Middle East, number of beneficiaries, operational\n            costs, operational efficiency, operational improvements,\n            operator contract, Performance Indicators, pipe, pipeline,\n            Pollution, power consumption, pressure, Preventive\n            Maintenance, private operator, private operators, project\n            management, public company, Public Works, pumping, quality\n            of water, quantity, quantity of water, raw water, resource\n            conservation, reverse osmosis, SANITATION, sanitation\n            sector, sanitation services, scarce water, scarce water\n            resources, scarcity of water, Sea, Service Area, sewerage\n            network, Sud, tariff increase, utility management, Utility\n            Policy, wastewater, wastewater services, wastewater system,\n            wastewater systems, Water Authority, Water Company, Water\n            connections, water distribution, water facilities, water\n            management, water meters, water quality, Water resource,\n            Water resource management, water resources, water scarcity,\n            water sector, water service, water supplies, Water supply,\n            water supply facilities, water supply projects, water supply\n            system, Water Utility"}},"owner":"Sustainable Development (MNSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF027144-PHRD-AMMAN WATER &\n            SANITATION MGMT.

The project consists\n            of four components. First, Management Contract\n            Operator's base fee will pay for salaries and expenses\n            of the operator's core group of staff managing the\n            operations of the Service Area's water and wastewater\n            infrastructure. Second, Operating Investment Fund (OIF) will\n            finance the Operator and the Water Authority to support\n            essential short-term and operating investments to improve\n            operation and maintenance and support in the rehabilitation\n            of the water and sewerage system. Third, Capital investment\n            will support design, implementation, and supervision of the\n            restructuring and rehabilitation of the water supply system\n            as well as upgrading and extending service coverage. Fourth,\n            technical assistance will strengthen the planning and\n            management unit, provide independent auditors to monitor the\n            Operator's technical and financial
