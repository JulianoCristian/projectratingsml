The experience of\n            this project suggests that there has been a slowdown in the\n            pace of reforms since the new government took over in May\n            2004. Two components of the project supported reform\n            program-charging for electricity used by farmers, and public\n            enterprise reform program-have suffered. But other program\n            gains continued. Despite some slippage during the election\n            year (2003-04), the new government continues to emphasize\n            fiscal prudence, and has achieved good results. Governance,\n            and the public financial management reform agenda continues\n            to move forward. The pro-farmer and pro-rural tilt in the\n            new government's policy is quite visible: as part of\n            its program to enhance the access of the poor to land, some\n            155,000 acres of land were distributed to poor and landless\n            groups in January 2005. By and large, the direction of the\n            overall reform program remains unchanged. Looking ahead, the\n            program details a set of actions in eight key areas that are\n            indicative for a future third operation, whose actions would\n            need to be largely met before the operation can move\n            forward, and, it was noted that overall reform progress in\n            Andhra Pradesh has been mixed. An understanding with the\n            Government of Andhra Pradesh was reached to strongly pursue\n            the reform agenda."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Andhra Pradesh Economic\n            Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second Andhra Pradesh\n            Economic Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5695492/india-second-andhra-pradesh-economic-reform-project","projn":"IN-Andhra Pradesh Economic Reform Program II\n            -- P075191","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,National Governance,Poverty Assessment,Governance Indicators,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050329105516"},"subsc":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Sub-national government administration,Health,General industry and trade sector,General education sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accountability, accounting, Adjustment\n            Lending, aggregate fiscal discipline, anticorruption,\n            auditing, audits, Bank Performance, Banks, bidding, budget\n            process, child nutrition, civil servants, Civil Service,\n            commercial taxes, Consolidation, credit/loan, Debt,\n            deficits, deregulation, economic growth, Economic\n            Management, ECONOMIC REFORM, education, elections,\n            electricity, employment, enterprise reform, enterprise\n            restructuring/privatization, expenditures, families,\n            Financial Accountability, financial management, financial\n            performance, fiscal management, fiscal performance, fiscal\n            policy, Fiscal reform, fiscal responsibility, Fiscal\n            Surplus, FISCAL YEAR, funds flow, government guarantees,\n            health, health sector, human capital, Human Resource\n            Management, IN/CREDIT, Innovation, Institutional\n            Development, internal controls, leadership, legislation,\n            licenses, living standards, Loan/Credit, local government,\n            motor vehicle taxes, municipalities, Net profit,\n            outputs/outcomes, partnership, PCD, penalties,\n            Pension/Unemployment, private sector, procurement, program\n            implementation, provisioning, Public Enterprises, Public\n            expenditure, Public expenditure management, Public Sector,\n            Public Sector Management, public spending, Redemption,\n            reform implementation, reform process, reform processes,\n            reform programs, reforms, resource allocation, revenue\n            mobilization, revenue performance, Revenue Reform, roads,\n            service delivery, service quality, small scale industries,\n            social development, social issues, social services,\n            social/human development, Structural Adjustment,\n            supervision, Tax, tax revenue, technical assistance,\n            transparency, transport, urban development, urban poverty, utilities"}},"owner":"Econ.

Although poverty has\n            declined in AP, the reduction is smaller than in other\n            Indian states, particularly when compared with the other\n            Southern states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and the pace of\n            poverty reduction has been relatively slower in rural areas.\n            In order to meet its poverty reduction goals, the challenge\n            for AP is to improve the access of the poor to credit and\n            social services (particularly, health and education),\n            especially in rural areas. The goal of universal primary\n            enrollment by 2015 is likely to be met, but achieving the\n            targeted completion and retention rates will be a challenge.\n            There has been progress towards gender equality in the labor\n            market and in education, but targeted interventions are\n            clearly necessary in order to eliminate the gender gap in\n            education. Despite its recent efforts in improving school\n            enrollments, the state continues to lag behind other states\n            in literacy and education outcomes. Moreover, there are\n            significant disparities across location, gender, income\n            group and social category. The state is making efforts to\n            address these problems. In the health sector, the challenges\n            are even bigger. The state is on track to achieve its target\n            of reducing maternal mortality to three-quarters of its 1990\n            level by 2015, and the goal of halving the proportion of\n            people without access to safe drinking water is also likely\n            to met. Despite the very clear emphasis on health outcomes\n            in Vision 2020 , however, the sector lacks a clear focus on\n            outcomes and would benefit from a more focused strategy. The\n            major health status indicators are worse in AP than in\n            comparator southern states, and in some cases improvement\n            seems to have stalled. Meeting the goal of reducing child\n            mortality rates to two-thirds of the 1990 level by 2015 is\n            unlikely given the rate of progress to date. Though\n            numerical targets are unclear, progress towards combating\n            HIV/AIDS and other diseases like tuberculosis has also been\n            slow in the 1990s."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Andhra Pradesh Economic\n            Reform Loan/Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second Andhra Pradesh\n            Economic
