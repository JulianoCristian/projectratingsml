Some lessons\n            learned included: low income countries, that are\n            experiencing severe financial constraints and are able to\n            afford little more in education than the payment of salaries\n            and other recurrent costs, can often benefit greatly from\n            the infusion of short-term grant funds for financing capital\n            expenditures and other development expenses. Connecting the\n            delivery of services to traditional ways of doing things\n            (for example, putting kindergartens in movable buildings\n            within nomad communities) can often make these services more\n            attractive, affordable, and culturally acceptable. The use\n            of a consultative framework like the education donors'\n            consultative mechanism, which was effectively used as a\n            steering group during the first three years of the project,\n            can be a good way to bring donors together and to promote\n            cooperation and interagency planning. In designing outcome\n            indicators for an intervention or set of interventions like\n            those financed by the EFA-FTI grant, it is critical that the\n            indicators be linked causally to project inputs, processes,\n            and outputs so that there is no question about attribution.\n            Innovative, eco-friendly building designs are becoming\n            increasingly available in a variety of climactic zones\n            (include Mongolia's, characterized by cold and windy\n            conditions) and need to be promoted as a way of saving\n            resources and improving air and water quality. Regarding\n            school construction, given the short construction season in\n            Mongolia due to weather limitations, as well as booming\n            demand, future projects need to plan carefully, assess local\n            capacity, and supervise implementation closely."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Education for all Fast-Track\n            Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Trust
