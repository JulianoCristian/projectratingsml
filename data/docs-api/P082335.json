Some lessons\n            learned included: the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) has\n            contributed to the alignment of both Development Program\n            (DP) and Government budgeting and accounting through a\n            single system thereby contributing to a reduction in\n            transaction costs. Central, programmatic and SWAp funding\n            are essential for implementation of health services in\n            raising health indicators as exemplified by funding for NMCP\n            Nutrition and HIV/AIDS program. At the time of project\n            implementation, the SWAp contributed to greater sector\n            coherence and consistency, which secured higher levels of\n            both domestic and external financial resources for health\n            throughout the implementation period. Compared to the set of\n            loosely or non-coordinated projects and programs previously\n            in place, SWAp delivered real improvement in sector\n            coordination and dialogue. Non-salary, discretionary\n            resources at local/facility level seem to have played a\n            critical role in the results attained. It is an important\n            lesson as we continue to consider supporting such resource allocations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Second Health Sector Development

The Second Health Sector\n            Strategic Plan (HSSP II) was launched in 2003 and was\n            supported by over 20 development partners through a mix of\n            general budget support, the Health Basket Fund (HBF), and\n            targeted project financing (largely for malaria and AIDS).\n            The additional financing will fund scaled-up activities to\n            enhance the impact of this well-performing project,\n            specifically covering costs associated with the initial two\n            years of Third Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP III). The\n            project has contributed to the Government of Tanzania's\n            long term health sector program.
