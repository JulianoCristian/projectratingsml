Some lessons learned\n            included: 1) a stable macroeconomic and political\n            environment contributed greatly to the successful\n            implementation of difficult structural reforms in Vietnam;\n            2) overall, progress was slower in policy areas\n            characterized by limited political will, conflicting\n            institutional responsibilities or insufficient analytical\n            work; 3) an effective coordination mechanism is essential to\n            overcome the logistical challenges posed by a wide ranging\n            and cross-cutting policy dialogue; and 4) the Vietnam\n            experience demonstrates that poverty reduction support\n            credit programs, with very low conditionality, are a\n            well-suited aid instrument in countries with strong\n            government ownership of the reform agenda and its capacity\n            to deliver in practice."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - First-Fifth Poverty

donor\n            community, to stay engaged with a client that has delivered\n            an outstanding performance in terms of economic growth and\n            poverty reduction. The project strengthens the reform\n            program on several fronts: 1) promotes greater competition\n            and faster integration with the world economy. The credit\n            supports actions aimed at gaining accession to the World\n            Trade Organization (WTO), measures to accelerate the\n            divestiture of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in\n            non-strategic sectors, adoption of a more determined\n            approach to banking reform, and introduction of regulatory\n            bodies for infrastructure services. 2) The project also\n            promotes human development and environmental protection. It\n            supports improvements in the quality of education,\n            especially in poor areas, and, also endorses measures aimed\n            at protecting and developing forests, which sustain the\n            livelihoods of many poor households. Moreover, it includes\n            the adoption of a better regulatory framework in relation to\n            the environment. 3) The introduction of modern planning\n            methods, focused on attaining development outcomes, is also\n            supported, in addition to other measures aimed at enhancing\n            transparency and improving governance, i.e., increased\n            disclosure for all state budget entities, strengthened\n            accountability through the independence of the State Audit,\n            and improved information systems. While risks exist, the\n            government is taking steps towards more effective\n            anti-corruption policies, and, rapidly emerging and\n            fast-growing provincial investment funds could contribute to\n            the development of infrastructure at the local level,\n            despite their limited transparency and accountability, which\n            remains a matter of concern."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Fourth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Fourth Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit
