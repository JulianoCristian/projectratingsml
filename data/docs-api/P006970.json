Lessons\n            Learned suggest that a regional approach provides for\n            greater aid effectiveness in small island developing states,\n            for it provides this aid effectiveness through economies of\n            scale, and in turn, increases synergies in areas where\n            resources, both human and financial, are limited. The\n            regional approach can also help to effectively coordinate\n            the dissemination and replication of lessons learned during\n            implementation of country-specific components. Furthermore,\n            the regional approach fosters a competitive environment\n            between countries, providing benchmarks that inspire greater\n            performance on a national level. Moreover, project\n            components must have a built in flexibility, and realistic\n            time table when dealing with multiple countries, with\n            varying development capacities, and needs. Flexibility can\n            be achieved through a demand-driven approach. In this\n            project, the change to a demand-driven approach had a\n            positive impact on implementation, as countries felt they\n            could seek assistance to best fit their needs. Similarly,\n            the provision for a Regional Coordinating Unit (RCU) is a\n            useful method that facilitates project supervision for\n            multiple country projects: the RCU in this project was able\n            to provide key regional leadership, that ensured regional\n            coordination, and consistency in approaches to solid waste\n            management issues. Further lessons address the need for\n            public awareness and education as essential in building\n            support for major changes; balancing regional\n            standardization, and potential efficiency gains, with\n            country specific needs, to ensure the full benefits of a\n            joint procurement; and, dealing with sub-national island\n            systems, taken into account at the time of project design,\n            as well as during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Antigua and Barbuda; Dominica; Grenada; St.\n            Kitts and Nevis; St. Lucia; St.
