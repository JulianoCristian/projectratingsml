Despite\n            success, some lessons of experience convey the following.\n            The use of well-defined indicators linked to expected\n            outcomes, agreed ex-ante with the Borrower, serves an\n            important dual purpose: first, it helps improve project\n            design and implementation by ensuring focus, and aligning\n            interventions towards the achievement of a set of clear\n            benchmarks; and, second, it helps the Borrower, central and\n            local governments in centering their policy dialogue on\n            specific actions. For the successful introduction of such a\n            results-oriented culture, several conditions need to be in\n            place: Policy instruments are needed to bring the nationally\n            agreed targets to the operational level; Incentives, to\n            comply with set targets and sustain the level of effort and\n            interest; and, The health sector must have the appropriate\n            means to reach the agreed upon targets.

Adopting\n            a results-based approach centered on yearly targets for\n            eight basic health indicators, the project quickly made\n            immunization more widely available and helped the poor gain\n            better access to health care services. In response to these\n            results, the World Bank in June 2001 approved 35 million\n            dollars for the project\u0092s second phase. This second phase of\n            the initiative has as its overall goal a reduction of infant\n            mortality to no more than 48 for every 1,000 babies born by\n            2008, versus 67 for each 1,000 in 1998."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Aider les enfants \u00e0 vivre en bonne sant\u00e9 en Bolivie"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Helping children lead healthier\n            lives in Bolivia : Aider les enfants \u00e0 vivre en bonne sant\u00e9\n            en Bolivie"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23833605/helping-children-lead-healthier-lives-bolivia-aider-les-enfants-\u00e0-vivre-en-bonne-sant\u00e9-en-bolivie","count":"Bolivia","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to health care, access to health care\n            services, births, families, health care, health care\n            delivery, health coverage, health indicators, Health Sector,\n            Health Sector Reform, health workers, immunization, infant\n            mortality, infant mortality rates, mortality, workers"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"majtheme":"Human development,Public sector governance,Social dev/gender/inclusion","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Una vida mejor para los ninos de Bolivia"},"1":{"cdata!":"Una vida mejor para los ninos de Bolivia"}},"topic":"Health Policy and Planning m1327535 1401,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Education m1327026 1463,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Child Health m1326775 642","projn":"BO-Health Sector Reform Apl II -- P074212,BO-Health Reform-Apl I -- P060392","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Health Law,Health Economics & Finance,Gender and Health,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Law and Development,Gender","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150120093738"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!South America"}},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Health,Central government administration,Compulsory health finance,Sub-national government administration,Other social services,Health,Central government administration,Compulsory health finance,Sub-national government administration,Other social services","theme":"Public expenditure, financial management and procurement,Participation and civic engagement,Child health,Health system performance,Population and reproductive health,Indigenous peoples,Participation and civic engagement,Child health,Health system performance,Population and reproductive health","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Law and Development,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Health Policy and Planning m1327535 1401,Health Equity and Access m1326151 1288,Health Education m1327026 1463,Health Care Resource Allocation m1326825 628,Child Health m1326775 642","owner":"Health, Nutr & Population -
