To produce development results, the\n            Bank needs to pay attention to the design of the credit, the\n            quality of prior actions, and their relation to the expected\n            outcomes. PRSCs are unlikely to be as effective as\n            investment and sector operations for solving specific sector\n            issues. The PRSCs tended to cover macroeconomic and sector\n            issues in a broad manner, making it difficult to cultivate\n            ownership in the agencies responsible for implementing the\n            program. The assistance is more likely to succeed when the\n            Bank targets specific problems and works their solution with\n            the agencies in charge of executing the program. A program\n            of budget support tends to create a higher permanent level\n            of Government expenditure that may not be sustainable in the\n            medium term. Predictable budget support may create\n            inflexibilities in expenditure, forcing donors to continue\n            their support beyond what is needed and desirable. Uganda\n            exemplifies this situation as the PRSC series grew over time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - First, Second, Third, and Fourth\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit

- Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The ratings for the Poverty Reduction\n            Support Credits for Uganda were as follows: the outcome was\n            satisfactory, the sustainability was likely, the\n            institutional development impact was modest, and the Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory and the borrower\n            performance satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that\n            the most vital element in poverty reduction is arguably the\n            improvement of incomes of the poor. While many efforts have\n            been made to ensure civic involvement and participation,\n            especially in the preparation of the Poverty Eradication\n            Action Plan (PEAP) and in carrying out participatory poverty\n            assessments, work remains to be done at the district level.\n            Future Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) should\n            avoid being over-reaching, stating goals and results that\n            cannot be achieved rapidly. Future PRSCs need to state\n            results and outcomes in more concrete and measurable terms,\n            although this is much easier said than done. Because of the\n            learning-from-experience potential of the PRSC, and because\n            of its lack of formal implementation beyond the agreement\n            and enactment of Prior Actions, As the PRSC instrument\n            evolved, there has been a clear improvement in the\n            understanding of what needs to be done and of the most\n            effective ways of doing it. Because Uganda is highly\n            dependent on donor aid for its poverty reduction efforts,\n            and because the more efficient delivery of aid through the\n            PRSC has resulted in absorption problems, it is essential\n            that the Bank, donors, and government develop and agree on a\n            long-term financing strategy which should govern and\n            coordinate future levels of donor aid. The two most\n            problematic aspects of the PRSC, namely corruption and\n            defense spending, need to be translated more effectively\n            into essential requirements and pre-requisites for the\n            entire Bank program of support, and not left to the PRSC as\n            a burden to carry."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda -

This includes reforms aimed at\n            improving public expenditure management and strengthening\n            monitoring and evaluation. 2) Improved governance through\n            cross-cutting public sector reforms, such as the reform o f\n            public service and pay, public procurement, financial\n            management, strengthening monitoring and evaluation, and\n            measures to increase transparency, civil society\n            participation, and fight against corruption. The revision o\n            f the current public pay structure and human resource\n            management practices will help the Government recruit and\n            retain high-quality staff. Improvements in public\n            procurement and financial management will promote\n            accountability for public resources, and enhanced\n            transparency, participation, and anti- corruption efforts\n            will help citizens hold their leaders and public officials\n            more accountable for the quantity and quality of services.\n            3) Promotion of enabling environment for rural development,\n            including steps to improve the effectiveness of agricultural\n            marketing, research and advisory services, and the promotion\n            of rural finance, rural roads, and sustainable natural\n            resource management. Stimulating agricultural and rural\n            growth rates is essential for sustained poverty reduction,\n            since 96 percent of the poor live in rural areas and most of\n            them earn their living from agriculture. 4) Improved access\n            to and quality of education, health care, and water and\n            sanitation services. Delivery of basic services will not\n            improve unless binding sector-specific constraints are\n            addressed.

issues for the third Poverty\n            Reduction Support Credit (PRSC3) Project for Uganda. This EA\n            repeats the previous impact and mitigation considerations of\n            the previous EA for PRSC2, and adds more details regarding\n            resettlement and pesticides. Degradation of environmental\n            and natural resources is anticipated in the form of\n            deforestation, loss of natural habitats, loss of top soil,\n            uncontrolled growth of water hyacinths, pollution of water\n            bodies, and brush land burning. Environmental regulations\n            recommend for ecologically sensitive areas that the\n            following measures be taken: use of appropriate farming\n            methods, curbing of soil erosion, and protection of water\n            catchments. The National Environmental Statute of 1995\n            (NEMA) prohibits activities that will reclaim and drain the\n            wetlands; and limits other human activities in the wetlands.\n            In the same manner it also prohibits activities that will\n            lead to destruction of forest and hillsides areas. Measures\n            to mitigate potential adverse impacts of pesticide use will\n            be taken through the ongoing National Agriculture Advisory\n            Services Project (NAADS) and include training of input\n            suppliers, and farmers and service providers as well as the\n            promotion of alternative pest management methods, including\n            best mix of biological or cultural controls. Health care\n            waste management considerations related to the health care\n            facilities include: raising awareness , developing an\n            integrated management plan, ensuring segregation of special\n            HCW from other waste, determining appropriate treatment\n            technology and disposal site for facility, ensuring proper\n            packaging, storage, and transport of special HCW, training\n            health care workers, and addressing scavenging issues.\n            Checklists identify other potential environmental issues\n            such as borehole drilling for water supply, expanding and\n            improving the existing water supply, latrine, other\n            sanitation facilities, and wastewater treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uganda - Third Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Project : environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uganda - Third Poverty Reduction\n
