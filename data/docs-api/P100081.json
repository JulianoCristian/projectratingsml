Some lessons\n            learned includes: collaboration among sectors. The lesson is\n            that collaboration across sectors is possible, but it\n            requires substantial dedicated resources and an impartial\n            lead partner. An emergency and interest from senior leaders,\n            technical teams, agencies and partner countries help\n            facilitate coordination as well. Excessive gaps between\n            animal health and human health systems persist. The lesson\n            is that the next emergency response to a zoonotic disease\n            threat should endeavour to more adequately address a key\n            factor giving rise to the emergency-the inability of country\n            public health and veterinary systems to protect public\n            health and economies from infectious disease outbreaks. A\n            formal arrangement and positive incentives for cross-support\n            will have facilitated the team's work with Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MOA). Partner continuity between the emergency\n            and a program for medium long-term systemic improvements\n            will likely help the transition succeed. The participatory\n            design of indicators and their alignment with the national\n            plan's overarching objectives supported coordination.\n            The systematic supervision approach encouraged coordination\n            and is an example of best practice."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lao PDR - Avian and Human Influenza Control\n            and Preparedness Project :

The authorities in Lao PDR rapidly prepared a\n            program to strengthen their capacity for surveillance of\n            animal diseases and containment of outbreaks. Better public\n            knowledge of avian and pandemic flu and training of\n            veterinary and health workers will encourage prevention and\n            reporting of disease.
