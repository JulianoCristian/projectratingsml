Key lessons address first of all, the\n            need to gauge project design with the existing\n            institutional, and professional capacity in the country,\n            particularly in complex operations such as this one, which\n            could have avoided the slow implementation start of the\n            project, resulting from inadequate professional capacity,\n            and inexperienced management of the various executing\n            agencies involved. Road design underestimated construction\n            costs, a factor which could have been avoided had detailed\n            technical designs been completed prior to construction;\n            moreover, based on experience, much higher financial bids\n            are offered to previously estimated construction costs, when\n            updated road design studies are unavailable at bidding.\n            Furthermore, to ensure design quality, the terrain and\n            climate conditions needs to be reviewed. As such, due to\n            conditions in the Andean Mountains, full rehabilitation\n            where possible, and reduced rehabilitation in critical\n            zones, would have been appropriate. Performance indicators\n            should be in place to monitor implementation, as well as\n            institutional performance, to identify, and solve difficult\n            issues early on. The absence of qualified personnel from\n            executing agencies, calls for specific technical training\n            programs to be developed, or, include experienced\n            international consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Transport Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Transport Rehabilitation

infrastructure; (ii) assist Government\n            in implementing institutional reform in road and railway\n            subsectors; and (iii) lay the ground work for future\n            projects focussing on strengthened road management,\n            increased private participation in the transport sector, and\n            improved mobility of the poor. The project will consist of\n            five components, the most important concerning road\n            rehabilitation. Six roads totalling 725 km will be\n            rehabilitated under the project. In addition, this component\n            will include: (i) a bridge program involving the acquisition\n            and recovery of Bailey bridges and the reconstruction of\n            derelict old bridges; (ii) a pilot maintenance program\n            focussing on 620 km of road in a specified corridor; and\n            (iii) a traffic safety program. In parallel, the project\n            will support government efforts to rebuild an institutional\n            structure capable of maintaining the road system. The second\n            component will help to privatize and rehabilitate the\n            railway, by: (i) reducing staff redundancy; (ii)\n            rationalizing railway debt; (iii) closing down or receiving\n            budgetary transfers from the Government for unprofitable\n            services; and (iv) rehabilitating track, telecommunications\n            and locomotives to keep the railway in operating condition\n            while the privatization process is underway. The third\n            component concerns the rehabilitation of Lima's airport\n            runway which is in urgent need of repair, before it becomes\n            in danger to aviation. The fourth component will be a pilot\n            project for non-motorized transport in Lima to test methods\n            of promoting the use of bicycles by low-income residents.\n            The fifth component, technical assistance and training,\n            will; (i) strengthen the institutional capacity for managing\n            roads and bridges, and support the creation and fostering of\n            an autonomous agency responsible for planning, operating,\n            financing, and administering the highway network; (ii) build\n            capacity to manage environmental issues; and (iii) assist\n            the railway in its privatization and improving its management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Transport Rehabilitation

- Transport Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Transport Sector Rehabilitation\n            Project's main objectives are to: (i) rehabilitate\n            essential transport infrastructure; (ii) assist Government\n            in implementing institutional reform in road and railway\n            subsectors; and (iii) lay the ground work for future\n            projects focussing on strengthened road management,\n            increased private participation in the transport sector, and\n            improved mobility of the poor. The project will consist of\n            five components, the most important concerning road\n            rehabilitation. Six roads totalling 725 km will be\n            rehabilitated under the project. In addition, this component\n            will include: (i) a bridge program involving the acquisition\n            and recovery of Bailey bridges and the reconstruction of\n            derelict old bridges; (ii) a pilot maintenance program\n            focussing on 620 km of road in a specified corridor; and\n            (iii) a traffic safety program. In parallel, the project\n            will support government efforts to rebuild an institutional\n            structure capable of maintaining the road system. The second\n            component will help to privatize and rehabilitate the\n            railway, by: (i) reducing staff redundancy; (ii)\n            rationalizing railway debt; (iii) closing down or receiving\n            budgetary transfers from the Government for unprofitable\n            services; and (iv) rehabilitating track, telecommunications\n            and locomotives to keep the railway in operating condition\n            while the privatization process is underway. The third\n            component concerns the rehabilitation of Lima's airport\n            runway which is in urgent need of repair, before it becomes\n            in danger to aviation. The fourth component will be a pilot\n            project for non-motorized transport in Lima to test methods\n            of promoting the use of bicycles by low-income residents.\n            The fifth component, technical assistance and training,\n            will; (i) strengthen the institutional capacity for managing\n            roads and bridges, and support the creation and fostering of\n            an autonomous agency responsible for planning, operating,\n            financing, and administering the highway network; (ii) build\n            capacity to manage environmental issues; and (iii) assist\n            the railway in its privatization and improving its management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Transport Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Transport Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/02/733013/peru-transport-rehabilitation-project","projn":"PE-Transp.Rhb -- P008045","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Urban Transport,Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways,National Governance","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Peru","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961005065537"},"subsc":"Aviation,Central government administration,Roads and highways,Railways","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"auditors,authorization,autonomous\n            agency,autonomy,bicycles,bridge,Bridge\n            Rehabilitation,bridges,budgetary resources,Cement,civil\n            service,Competitive\n            Bidding,debt,employment,execution,financial\n            resources,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,government\n            policy,Housing,human resource,human resource\n            development,labor productivity,Lime,matching\n            funds,mobility,motor vehicles,motorized\n            Transport,Municipality,NMT,PAVED\n            ROADS,PCU,Plaster,privatization,productivity,public\n            sector,railways,Rate of Return,representatives,road\n            finance,road maintenance,road management,road\n            rehabilitation,road system,road user charges,road\n            users,roads,safety program,sharing,state-owned\n            enterprises,subsidiary,technical assistance,traffic,traffic\n            safety,Transport,transport projects,transport\n            sector,transport system"},"1":{"cdata!":"auditors,authorization,autonomous\n            agency,autonomy,bicycles,bridge,Bridge\n            Rehabilitation,bridges,budgetary resources,Cement,civil\n            service,Competitive\n            Bidding,debt,employment,execution,financial\n            resources,FISCAL,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,government\n            policy,Housing,human resource,human resource\n            development,labor productivity,Lime,matching\n            funds,mobility,motor vehicles,motorized\n            Transport,Municipality,NMT,PAVED\n            ROADS,PCU,Plaster,privatization,productivity,public\n            sector,railways,Rate of Return,representatives,road\n            finance,road maintenance,road management,road\n            rehabilitation,road system,road user charges,road\n            users,roads,safety program,sharing,state-owned\n            enterprises,subsidiary,technical assistance,traffic,traffic\n            safety,Transport,transport projects,transport\n            sector,transport system"}},"owner":"Transport (LCSTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF021155-GTZ TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT,TF020350-DANISH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF023012-PHRD-TRANSPORT SECTOR REHABILITATION,TF020400-NETHERLANDS' CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF022911-TRANSPORT SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT","repnb":"P6185"},"facets":{}}}
