The bridge became a\n            symbol of Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019s tolerance in a region\n            known for its ethnic and religious diversity until war\n            overwhelmed the former Yugoslavia. Following the conclusion\n            of the war, the government tried for several years to\n            rebuild the bridge. However, due to lack of financing and\n            technical capacity, as well as political and ethnic\n            sensitivities, all efforts were unsuccessful. The\n            International Development Association (IDA) financed\n            cultural heritage pilot project launched in 1999. Because of\n            the symbolism inherent in the reconstruction of the Old\n            Bridge, the project was meant to promote a climate of\n            reconciliation, the main pre-requisite for economic\n            revitalization and social cohesion. The re-opening of the\n            Old Bridge has contributed to the reconciliation of\n            war-divided people living on the banks of the Neretva River.\n            In addition to rebuilding the graceful arch of the bridge\n            and its towers, the project restored other damaged\n            monuments, which helped preserve the character of Mostar\u2019s\n            historic cobble-stoned old town.

Lessons are conveyed as\n            follows. Cultural Heritage preservation can be a viable\n            theme for urban physical revitalization, most importantly\n            for promoting reconciliation: had the Bridge and Towers not\n            been rehabilitated, they would have remained a constant\n            reminder of war and divisions among communities. As it is\n            now, the re-constructed Bridge is a symbol of re-established\n            ties, that better times are ahead, and that the shared\n            history will hopefully lead to a better future. However,\n            projects in cultural heritage require patience, and the\n            involvement of most stakeholders. Particularly, where the\n            structure to be renovated is internationally renowned,\n            UNESCO participation is essential to ensure technical and\n            aesthetic qualities. Given the Bank's limited\n            experience in participating in such partnerships, and the\n            partner's unfamiliarity with Bank procedures, more\n            explicit attention to creating this understanding, might\n            have expedited the process. While the impact of the Bridge\n            and Towers on the attitudes of the population is\n            undisputable, having included smaller components, especially\n            public restorations, added a particularly important\n            dimension to the project in reaching the communities, and\n            providing the citizens with opportunities for benefiting\n            immediately from restorations - such as those in the\n            neighborhood and monuments components, through the\n            renovation of specific smaller community structures and\n            public spaces."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Cultural Heritage\n            Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bosnia and Herzegovina - Cultural\n            Heritage Pilot Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6030874/bosnia-herzegovina-cultural-heritage-pilot-project","projn":"BA-Cultural Heritage Pilot Project -- P059763","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050628103124"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Other social services,Sub-national government administration","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"actions, bridge, bridges, capacity building,\n            climate, communities, community activities, community\n            structures, concrete, conservation, conservation principles,\n            consultation, Cultural Heritage, Cultural Heritage\n            preservation, cultural heritage sites, cultural\n            institutions, economic benefits, feasibility studies, films,\n            flexibility, framework, historic buildings, HISTORIC\n            DISTRICTS, historic preservation, housing, improvements,\n            Institutional Development, landscaping, learning, Lessons\n            Learned, local contractors, Monuments, neighborhood,\n            neighborhoods, operations, partnership, PCU, preservation,\n            Private sector, procurement, Project Appraisal, Project\n            Cycle, project implementation, project monitoring, project\n            preparation, Public sector, Quality at Entry, rate of\n            return, restoration, social assessment, social cohesion,\n            social services, stakeholders, statistical data,\n            supervision, Sustainability, symbols, tourism, urban\n            planning, urban revitalization, World Heritage sites"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Learning and Innovation Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF023553-BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA PILOT\n            CULTURAL HERITAGE PROJECT,TF023554-BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA PILOT\n            HERITAGE PROJECT,TF023567-DUTCH GRANT - BOSNIA AND\n            HERZEGOVINA PILOT HERITAGE PROJECT,TF029809-COUNCIL OF EUROPE DEVELOPMENT\n            BANK TF FOR BIH PILOT CULTURAL HERITAGE P,TF034595-MOLDOVA - SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND,TF037084-BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA - CULTURAL\n            HERITAGE PILOT,TF037205-BOSNIA - HERZEGOVINA - PILOT\n            CULTURAL HERITAGE PROJECT,TF037208-BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA -\n            PILOT CULTURAL HERITAGE PROJECT,TF037209-BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA -\n            PILOT CULTURAL HERITAGE PROJ.
