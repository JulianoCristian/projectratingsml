This restructuring paper seeks approval of the\n            Executive Directors to restructure the project to trigger\n            the pest management operational policy. In addition, the\n            restructuring paper informs the Board that the involuntary\n            resettlement policy was applied under the project and\n            reflected in the grant agreement, but it was not reflected\n            in the project appraisal document. No restriction of access\n            to natural resources within protected areas has occurred,\n            and none is expected to occur. However, in the unlikely\n            event that activities under second component for the\n            implementation of management plans in protected areas were\n            to restrict access to natural resources, a process framework\n            is in place to address this issue. The project is currently\n            rated moderately satisfactory for progress towards\n            achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO) and\n            Global Environmental Objective (GEO), and moderately\n            unsatisfactory for overall implementation progress. In the\n            first two years after effectiveness, the project suffered\n            severe delays. Since mid- 2010, project performance has been\n            mixed, with strong performance between mid- and end-2010.\n            The most recent project delay was caused by changes in key\n            leadership within the implementing agency, National\n            Authority of Environment (ANAM), in early 2011. The changes\n            consist of triggering the safeguard policy on pest\n            management to ensure that the project has the adequate\n            safeguard management framework to supervise that\n            agricultural pesticides are reaching target organisms, and\n            of appropriate classification consequently not posing an\n            environmental threat as well as protecting human health from\n            management and use of pesticides. A small use of acceptable\n            pesticides was envisaged for the implementation of the subprojects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Rural Productivity and\n            Consolidation of the Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological\n            Corridor Project : restructuring"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Rural Productivity and\n            Consolidation of the Atlantic Mesoamerican Biological\n            Corridor Project : restructuring"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/05/16445922/panama-rural-productivity-consolidation-atlantic-mesoamerican-biological-corridor-project-restructuring","projn":"PA-Rural Productivity Project (Gef) -- P083045","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Environmental Governance,Labor Policies,Housing & Human Habitats","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Environment,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Panama","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120629022420"},"theme":"Biodiversity,Rural non-farm income generation,Participation and civic engagement,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Decentralization","subsc":"Central government administration,Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Environment,Public Sector Development,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"action plan, communication strategy,\n            communities, conservation, employment, Environmental\n            Assessment, environmental investments, Environmental\n            Objective, Financial Management, Financial Report, Financing\n            Plan, Habitats, human health, ID, Implementing Agency,\n            income, Indigenous Peoples, leadership, monitoring system,\n            National Authority, natural ecosystems, natural resources,\n            pesticides, Procurement, PRODUCTIVITY, Resettlement, result,\n            Safety, supervision, technical assistance"}},"owner":"Agriculture & Rural Dev (LCSAR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"trustfund":"TF052549-GEF3 PDFB-PANAMA:SECOND RURAL\n            POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,TF056628-GEF FSP-PANAMA: RURAL\n            PRODUCTIVITY AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE ATLANTIC ME","majtheme":"Public sector governance,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"67358"},"facets":{}}}
