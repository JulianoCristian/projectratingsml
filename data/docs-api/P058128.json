Lessons highlight the valuable\n            project design, an experience integrating\n            telecommunications, information technology, and postal\n            components into a single operation, encouraging the\n            Government to broadly view information infrastructure in the\n            context of effective information for development, and global\n            convergence. Moreover, the realistic design appropriately\n            reflected the differences in institutional capabilities, and\n            political will, such as high expectations for\n            telecommunications, modest for the postal component, and\n            fragmentary for information technology. And, and important\n            factor was the introduction of competition, prior to\n            privatizing the incumbent telecommunications operator,\n            Itissalat Al-Maghrib (IAM). This accelerated service\n            roll-out, reduced prices, and strengthened commercial\n            management; the successful Global System for Mobile\n            Communications (GSM) tender, accelerated IAM privatization;\n            and, market competition prior to privatization, limited the\n            risk that IAM's monopoly privileges, would be extended\n            in an attempt to increase the sale price. Finally,\n            competition for, and in Morocco's markets has resulted\n            in rapid build-up of new networks, reducing the incremental\n            cost of rural service provision, and made new service\n            modalities, affordable to modest urban users."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
