Some of the main\n            lessons learned included confirmation that in a\n            violence-ridden and socially complex region, civil society\n            and nongovernmental organizations are adequate partners in\n            effective interventions, particularly where the presence of\n            public institutions is weak. In fact, its engagement with\n            the public sector can precisely introduce the institutional\n            dynamic and the spirit of collective decision making\n            necessary in this situation, in two ways: (i) enhancing\n            government capacity to operate in difficult conditions; and\n            (ii) promoting community participation and social\n            responsibility. Also, Learning and Innovation Loans (LILs)\n            are valuable lending instruments for pioneer projects and\n            for interventions in complex and delicate contexts; their\n            value added is particularly clear in the design of projects\n            that face risky conditions. The flexibility of the\n            Foundation as Project Executor and its recognition in the\n            Sierra as a neutral independent actor helped to overcome the\n            risks identified at preparation and encountered during\n            implementation. Finally, the project introduced a\n            participatory operational framework for rural development\n            and ecological conservation in the Sierra Nevada.\n            Interventions in the past were too small, fragmentary, or\n            isolated, as well as paternalistic. The project gave\n            grassroots organizations full responsibility for execution\n            and use of funds"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Sierra Nevada Sustainable\n
