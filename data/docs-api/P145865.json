Emergency Project to Assist Jordan\n            Partially Mitigate Impact of Syrian Conflict Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Emergency Project to Assist Jordan\n            Partially Mitigate Impact of Syrian Conflict Project for\n            Jordan received a satisfactory outcome rating with low risk\n            to development outcome. The Bank received a highly\n            satisfactory outcome rating while the Borrower\u0092s performance\n            rating was satisfactory. There were no restructurings of\n            this project and the project components remained unchanged\n            for the life of the project. The only change that occurred\n            was a fund reallocation from Component 1 subcomponent for\n            financing of health care services for drugs and vaccines.\n            There were several lessons gained from this project and\n            include the following: (1) Simplicity of operation through\n            existing delivery mechanisms for existing services which\n            allowed for quick preparation and implementation. (2)\n            Flexibility of financial response through the inherent\n            flexibility of the newly introduced OP 10.00 helped expedite\n            preparation and the World Bank\u0092s overall ability to respond\n            with speed to an urgent need. (3) The financial managment\n            approach was streamlined and based on more simplified ex\n            ante requirements, while relying more heavily on ex post\n            requirements as additional fiduciary controls and review\n            which allowed for timely disbursements. (4) Flexibility in\n            the design mechanism which provided for disbursements\n            against payments for expenditures allowed for the project\n            design to remain relevant and be responsive to any changes\n            during implementation in policies towards health and basic\n            social needs coverage and expenditures. (5) Retroactive\n            financing for a substantial amount of 40 percent was key to\n            the success of the emergency operation. (6) Temporary\n            time-bound support in emergency situations to help meet\n            essential household needs. These pro-poor interventions\n            through subsidies and price controls can help mitigate the\n            potential for social instability. (7) A strong relationship\n            between the Bank and the government on the ground allowed\n            for a rapid response. (8) The smooth coordination between\n            the different units within the World Bank was outstanding\n            and significantly contributed to the timely project\n            preparation and as well the smooth implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Emergency Project to Assist Jordan\n            Partially Mitigate Impact of Syrian Conflict

maintain access\n            to essential healthcare services and basic household needs\n            for the Jordanian population affected by the large and\n            increasing influx of Syrian refugees. The project has three\n            components. The first component is maintaining access to\n            essential healthcare services. This component aims to\n            sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to\n            the Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress\n            on resources resulting from the large influx of Syrian\n            refugees. It has following two sub-components: (i) provision\n            of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure adequate and\n            continuous supply at all public healthcare facilities; and\n            (ii) financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non-\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) health facilities. The second\n            component is supporting household basic needs. The objective\n            of this component is to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ)\n            ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household\n            commodities for poor and lower middle class households. The\n            two subsidized products financed under this component are\n            bread (wheat) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders.\n            The third component is project monitoring, auditing, and\n            verification. This component will finance: (i) the costs of\n            two special purpose audits as required for component one;\n            and (ii) the cost of an external auditor, acceptable to the\n            World Bank, who will be appointed to audit the project\n            financial statements covering the Project's 12 months\n            lifetime and for both components one and two."},"docna":{"cdata!":"\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646-\u0645\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0626 \u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u062c\u0632\u0626\u064a\u0627\n            \u062a\u062e\u0641\u064a\u0641 \u0623\u062b\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"\u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u062f\u0646 -

The project has three\n            components. The first component is maintaining access to\n            essential healthcare services. This component aims to\n            sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to\n            the Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress\n            on resources resulting from the large influx of Syrian\n            refugees. It has following two sub-components: (i) provision\n            of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure adequate and\n            continuous supply at all public healthcare facilities; and\n            (ii) financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non-\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) health facilities. The second\n            component is supporting household basic needs. The objective\n            of this component is to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ)\n            ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household\n            commodities for poor and lower middle class households. The\n            two subsidized products financed under this component are\n            bread (wheat) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders.\n            The third component is project monitoring, auditing, and\n            verification.
