Overall\n            performances of the World Bank and the Borrower are judged\n            as satisfactory. Lessons learned that may help with\n            continued implementation of the Coal Sector Reform or\n            implementation of similar sectoral reforms in Poland or\n            other countries are as follows: The Government's\n            comprehensive approach to coal sector reform has been\n            generally successful and should be maintained. The Program\n            needs to be adjusted to changing market conditions, to\n            ensure objectives, and not just the targets, of the reforms\n            achieved. A new plan for further capacity and employment\n            reduction should be developed during the final year of the\n            present Program. It appears to be very difficult to continue\n            employment restructuring on a solely voluntary basis.\n            Financial viability is possible but reforms need to continue\n            for this to be maintained. Privatization will be difficult\n            unless further reforms take place, but should be a priority\n            as it is required for real competition. Furthermore, the\n            earlier that privatization is accomplished, the sooner the\n            government will be able to transfer the price risk to\n            private owners and operators and protect itself and the\n            taxpayer from the risk of further subsidies. The extensive\n            dialogue between the Government and the trade unions was\n            important for the success of the Program. This type of\n            dialogue will also be key in designing the industry's\n            privatization and employment restructuring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Second Hard Coal Sector

         support implementation of the Government's 1998-2002\n            Hard Coal Sector Reform Program. In particular, SECAL2 will\n            support the Government in implementing the Revised Program\n            which contains more extensive mine closures and employment\n            reduction than in the original Program. Specific objectives\n            relate to support for actions to 1) assist workers leaving\n            the industry to find new jobs; 2) improve the industry\n            payment of taxes and fees to government; 3) accomplish\n            further progres regarding preparation for privatization; and\n            4) continue progress to improve environmental performance.\n            From the point of view of society, the immediate\n            beneficiaries of social mitigation measures under the\n            Program, and SECAL2, are the miners and their immediate\n            dependents. There are four major risks: 1) Despite the\n            extensive restructuring being undertaken under the Program,\n            the industry may not become profitable. 2) The employment\n            restructuring targets may not be achieved because of a\n            slow-down in take-up of severance packages by miners. Many\n            of the workers leaving the industry are women. 3) If the\n            industry does not become profitable, then environmental\n            performance may be restrained by a lack of funding. 4) Poor\n            financial performance may also be a barrier to privatization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Second Hard Coal Sector Adjustment\n            Loan
