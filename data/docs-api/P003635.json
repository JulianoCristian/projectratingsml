World Bank and Borrower\n            performances are satisfactory. Lessons learned regarding\n            project preparation include: A bottom-up approach to project\n            planning, design and implementation facilitates stakeholders\n            commitment and ensures successful implementation. Reforms in\n            curriculum, teaching-learning methods and student assessment\n            need to be firmly grounded in labor market demands.\n            Institutional development and its functional relevance to\n            the community and the economy are best ensured through links\n            with local enterprises and industries. Finalization of a\n            staff training program before credit/loan effectiveness and\n            early implementation will ensure that the trained staff will\n            have adequate time to bring benefits to the project. Lessons\n            related to project performance include: In support of\n            decentralization, implementation responsibilities should be\n            clearly delineated and strategically distributed to key\n            agencies at national, provincial, local and institutional\n            levels to ensure accountability and smooth coordination of\n            project activities. Successful project implementation with\n            multi-provinces/entities depends upon strong local capacity\n            built with targeted assistance and dedicated agencies\n            adequately staffed by trained personnel with the relevant\n            skills and experience. In support of school-based\n            management, establishment of School Boards (Governing\n            Council) and Industrial Liaison Committees is an effective\n            mechanism in embracing community participation and\n            partnership with industries. Decentralized and\n            provincial-based procurement under the guidance of\n            experienced national implementing agency accelerates the\n            procurement process, ensures end-user satisfaction, and\n            builds up provincial procurement capacity. Early procurement\n            training with close attention to contract management issues\n            will facilitate the establishment of a mechanism for\n            post-delivery follow-up service to end-users. Effective\n            communication between service providers and end-users is\n            essential for assessing user needs and providing quality\n            service for ICB procurement. Special accounts administered\n            by sector implementing agencies is likely to be more\n            efficient in facilitating timely disbursement and reducing delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Vocational Education Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Vocational Education\n            Reform Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2387260/china-vocational-education-reform-project","projn":"CN-Vocational Education Reform Project -- P003635","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Curriculum & Instruction,Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20030619130027"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Vocational training,Tertiary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,adaptability,adaptation,adult\n            education,classroom teaching,community\n            participation,computer\n            applications,curricula,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,curriculum\n            reform,decentralization,demonstration,development\n            program,economic development,education programs,Education\n            Reform,education sector,education\n            system,employment,enrollment,full participation,HUMAN\n            DEVELOPMENT,innovation,Institutional\n            Development,instruction,knowledge economy,labor\n            market,language proficiency,language\n            training,learning,learning materials,learning methods,local\n            authorities,managers,partnership,peer review,performance\n            indicators,poverty reduction,principals,proficiency,project\n            planning,Provincial Education,Quality Assurance,quality\n            management,school facilities,School Management,schools,staff\n            development,student enrollment,student\n            performance,Teacher,teachers,Teaching,teaching\n            materials,Teaching methods,teaching skills,teaching\n            staff,teaching techniques,technical education,Tertiary\n            education,trainees,training courses,training\n            programs,translation,tuition fees,urban areas,Vocational\n            Education,vocational skills,Vocational training,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,adaptability,adaptation,adult\n            education,classroom teaching,community\n            participation,computer\n            applications,curricula,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,curriculum\n            reform,decentralization,demonstration,development\n            program,economic development,education programs,Education\n            Reform,education sector,education\n            system,employment,enrollment,full participation,HUMAN\n            DEVELOPMENT,innovation,Institutional\n            Development,instruction,knowledge economy,labor\n            market,language proficiency,language\n            training,learning,learning materials,learning methods,local\n            authorities,managers,partnership,peer review,performance\n            indicators,poverty reduction,principals,proficiency,project\n            planning,Provincial Education,Quality Assurance,quality\n            management,school facilities,School Management,schools,staff\n            development,student enrollment,student\n            performance,Teacher,teachers,Teaching,teaching\n            materials,Teaching methods,teaching skills,teaching\n            staff,teaching techniques,technical education,Tertiary\n            education,trainees,training courses,training\n            programs,translation,tuition fees,urban areas,Vocational\n            Education,vocational skills,Vocational training,workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Dept (EASHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020761-AUSTRALIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST\n            FUND (USD),TF029178-PHRD-PREP.
