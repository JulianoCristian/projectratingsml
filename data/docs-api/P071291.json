Some lessons learned\n            included: banking sector reforms, particularly\n            privatization, require sustained commitment and political\n            will, which cannot be imposed by external parties. It is\n            difficult to sustain implementation progress over a very\n            long period, particularly in a fragile and conflict state.\n            This project went on for more than eight years, many of\n            which were characterized by conflict, and saw many changes\n            within the teams of the Bank and of the project\n            counterparts. The long duration made it very difficult to\n            sustain the performance beyond the initial years, especially\n            as the individuals involved in project preparation and early\n            implementation moved on to other positions. This posed\n            several challenges to their successors in an environment\n            emerging from conflict. Successive governments faced a broad\n            range of post conflict issues, and it became clear that\n            difficult financial sector reforms were not a high priority.\n            The Bank needs to be particularly vigilant to ensure a\n            measured sequencing of reforms in fragile countries and\n            conflict prone environments. The design and objectives of\n            FSTAP were no doubt overly ambitious, complex, and\n            time-consuming given the post conflict situation in Nepal. A\n            project which focused more narrowly on key objectives, for\n            example, the rapid resolution of Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB)\n            and Nepal Bank Limited (NBL), might have had more\n            sustainable results. The team approach towards the\n            restructuring of NBL worked very well. One firm was\n            recruited to undertake the restructuring and it brought in a\n            team of very strong professionals each matched with the\n            intended role. Whereas, the withdrawal of the firm selected\n            to manage RBB, a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and\n            individual consultants were hired in order to expedite hiring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Financial Sector Technical\n            Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Financial Sector\n            Technical Assistance
