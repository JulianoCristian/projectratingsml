Lessons reinforce the notion that\n            institutional reform is a long-term, and difficult process,\n            that requires difficult policy decisions. In this case,\n            reforms meant that the Ministry of Rural Development was to\n            reduce its control over the Institute of Rural Economy\n            (IER), and the National Agricultural Research Council\n            (CNRA), while ownership of vast plots of productive land\n            would be transferred from the Ministry of Finance to IER -\n            in a country where land pressures are increasing - and,\n            various ministries would loose control on IER as a large\n            employer. In such an environment, time to implement\n            institutional changes needs to be carefully evaluated;\n            regrettably, the project was overly optimistic, and,\n            covenants and conditions of disbursements, are not efficient\n            mechanisms to prod profound changes. Instead, a detailed\n            road map, stipulating precise steps, and expected results\n            should have been in place, to ease complex supervision.\n            Moreover, regardless of the appropriately selected project\n            indicators, these were never used to monitor progress, and\n            impacts; neither was the farm level impact of new\n            technologies followed, to prioritize research efforts, thus\n            resulting in a technology, based on proxy indicators, with\n            little knowledge of the actual constraints of such\n            technologies. This highlights the fact that a demand-driven\n            national system for technology generation, transfer, and\n            training, needs to unite all interested parties, taking into\n            account related activities, and strengthening producer\n            organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and private\n            sector service providers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - National Agricultural Research Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - National Agricultural\n            Research Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/06/1945961/mali-national-agricultural-research-project","projn":"ML-Mali:Ag.

The\n            principal objective of this Plan is to ensure that adequate\n            technology will become available to farmers as a means to\n            increase agricultural growth and to reverse the decline in\n            the productive capacity of the natural resource base.  The\n            project will aim at improving the performance of the\n            national agricultural research system by improving research\n            coherence, quality, relevance and accountability for results\n            through institutional reforms. To meet these objectives, the\n            project will:  (a) support the establishment of a National\n            Agricultural Research Council (NARC) which will integrate\n            research users and through which all official funding for\n            agricultural research will be coordinated and screened; (b)\n            support the transformation of IER into an autonomous\n            institution with an independent Board of Directors, and\n            reorganize and strengthen it to improve research efficiency\n            and accountability for results; (c) improve interactions\n            between researchers, farmers and extension staff through\n            farmer participation in setting research objectives and\n            evaluating its results, and through the establishment of a\n            pilot research fund available to contract for research; (d)\n            support the participation of Malian institutions and\n            scientists funded through NARC in regional and international\n            collaborative research programs; (e) provide funding for\n            priority research themes through the gradual introduction of\n            research contracts; (f) strengthen scientific, experiment\n            station, financial and human resources management, and\n            provide in-country and overseas training; and (g)\n            rehabilitate and renew experiment station and equipment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - National Agricultural Research Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mali - National Agricultural\n            Research Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/11/734468/mali-national-agricultural-research-project","projn":"ML-Mali:Ag.
