The performances of both the Bank and\n            the Borrower are satisfactory. The key lessons listed were:\n            1) Flexible project design needed: Despite well thought\n            through technical consideration, projects of this nature\n            being implemented in a very dynamic macroeconomic\n            environment (e.g., economic recovery, falling interest\n            rates, and increase in private savings) should have a more\n            flexible design to adjust to the implementation environment.\n            2) Single funding source or better blend funds needed; the\n            added complexity of the administration of both funds was not\n            adequately addressed at the designed stage which led to\n            additional complication in project implementation and\n            monitoring. 3) Providing the right information to the right\n            audience: To induce a faster rate of replacement,\n            information on proven energy savings, the high rate of\n            return to the investment on chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chiller\n            replacement, the reduced amount of CFC import quota, and the\n            continued reduction of global CFC production should be\n            disseminated by the government to the top management of\n            target enterprises that still have CFC chillers in\n            operations. 4) Clear policy and incentive mechanism:\n            Project experience has shown that unclear policy and\n            competing financial subsidies could lead to the suboptimal\n            outcome. 5) Refrigerant management of the recovered CFC: the\n            Department of Industrial Works together with the chiller and\n            refrigerant suppliers need to prepare a refrigerant\n            management strategy and action plan to cope with the\n            recovered CFC as more CFC chillers are being replaced. 6)\n            Periodic maintenance and monitoring has resulted in low\n            downtime; the operator was able to spot any operational\n            irregularities and optimize the energy consumption according\n            to the work environment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand -
