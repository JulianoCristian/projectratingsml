In October 1993, the Czech Republic\n            signed the United Nation (UN) framework convention on\n            climate change, and has since agreed to undertake efforts to\n            reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to meet the requirement\n            of stabilizing emissions at or below 1990 levels by the year\n            2000. This project was presented by the Government of the\n            Czech Republic for global environmental facility (GEF)\n            financing following a complicated and lengthy process of\n            project identification, analysis, and priority setting.

Both World Bank and Borrower performances were\n            adjudged as highly satisfactory. Lessons learned include the\n            following: Targets of specific gas consumption, estimated by\n            the project and stipulated in the turn-key contract, could\n            not be fully realized during the trial operation, and the\n            district heating company (TPK) had to settle for a higher\n            value because of contractual inconsistencies. Second,\n            technical problems with one waste heat boiler at the glass\n            factory postponed the implementation and start-up of the\n            second waste heat boiler until the technical problems of the\n            first boiler were solved. The resulting higher fuel\n            consumption of gas turbines is not critical to achieving the\n            objective to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but can lead\n            to higher operating costs and therefore reduced profits than\n            those . The boiler should have been tested properly at the\n            beginning of the operation to anticipate problems due to the\n            technological process of glass production--some mechanical\n            parts of the boiler could not work properly with the\n            contaminated air and the boiler had to be cleaned\n            frequently. It is difficult for a small independent power\n            producer to stay within a long-term contract with the\n            electric grid company if the production cost is not\n            competitive. The existing price structure would improved by\n            an electricity price increase to recognize that new plants\n            will be required in the future."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Czech Republic -
