Leone  - Bumbuna Hydroelectric\n            Environmental and Social Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Bumbuna Hydroelectric\n            Environmental and Social Management Project for Sierra Leone\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was high, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the measures necessary for environmental\n            and social safeguards compliance were revised and extended\n            several times during project implementation. Many of the\n            revisions were initiated by the two panels of experts. For\n            instance, the size of the environmental offset was revised\n            upwards, including the addition of the Loma Mountain\n            National Park. The number of people to be compensated under\n            the resettlement action plan, or RAP also was revised during\n            project implementation. The installation of a siren system\n            was added when the recruitment of an experienced operator\n            did not take place in time. While adjusting the social and\n            environmental activities to changing circumstances is\n            sometimes necessary, the scope and frequency of revisions is\n            notable. The Bank's environmental and social safeguards\n            policies apply to the entirety of an infrastructure project\n            supported by the Bank and its associated facilities,\n            regardless of the extent of Bank support. In the case of the\n            Bumbuna project, most construction activities already had\n            been completed when International Development Association,\n            or IDA financing became effective. The project tried to\n            retrofit good performance on a hydropower development that\n            was already near completion. As the Bank was not financing\n            construction, it had no formal relationship with the\n            contractor. Given the frequent power outages in Sierra\n            Leone, the GoSL's interest was mainly on commissioning\n            BHP as soon as possible. After project restructuring, the\n            operation exclusively supported environmental and social activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone  - Bumbuna Hydroelectric\n            Environmental

The restructuring will affect neither project outcomes\n            nor project development objectives and the project's\n            scope, results framework and outputs will remain unchanged.\n            The restructuring is comprised of two changes: a)\n            reallocation of additional grant resources of SDR 6.3\n            million among different expenditure categories to allow for\n            the supply, installation, commissioning and testing of\n            sirens, which was not envisaged in 2010; and b) extension of\n            the project closing date by nine months from September 30,\n            2012, to June 30, 2013 to allow for the remaining activities\n            to be completed. Further, the extension of the project\n            closing date will also allow the Bank to engage with the\n            Government of Sierra Leone to discuss and agree on a\n            sustainable mechanism under the broader energy-sector\n            dialogue to finance the Bumbuna safety, environmental and\n            social management measures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sierra Leone - Bumbuna\n            Hydroelectric Environmental and Social Management Project :\n            restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/09/16760543/sierra-leone-bumbuna-hydroelectric-environmental-social-management-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"SL-Bumbuna Hydroelectric Environmental And\n            Social Management Proje -- P086801","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"E-Business,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis,Labor Policies,Dams and Reservoirs,Housing & Human Habitats","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Water Resources,Poverty Reduction,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Sierra Leone","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20120924010426"},"theme":"Education for the knowledge economy,Pollution management and environmental health,Other social protection and risk management,Other social development,Environmental policies and institutions","subsc":"Central government administration,Rural and Inter-Urban Roads and Highways,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,General education sector","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Water Resources,Poverty Reduction,Social Protections and Labor,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plan, audits, capacity-building, CAS,\n            civil works, Commercial Bank, Communication strategy,\n            communities, community development, Dam, dam construction,\n            Dam Safety, Dam Safety Review, dam site, Description,\n            distribution network, Economic Development, electricity,\n            equipment, female, financial management, Financing Plan,\n            houses, housing, hydroelectric dam, HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT,\n            ID, Implementing Agency, impoundment, Income, installation,\n            Intermediate Outcomes, Livelihood, livelihoods, Management\n            Authority, Newsletter, Outcome Indicators, outputs,\n            Performance Indicators, PMU, PPA, procurement, Procurement\n            process, procurement processes, programs, Project\n            Beneficiaries, Project Management, Project Management Unit,\n            reservoir, reservoir area, Resettlement, result, Results,\n            Safeguard Policies, Safety, SAP, sites, Social Development,\n            Sustainable Development, targets, Technical Assistance,\n            Training workshop, trainings, transmission, User,\n            Verification, villages, water quality, Water Resources,\n            Watershed Management, web, wildlife"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 2 (AFTG2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF054650-JSDF SEED-SIERRA LEONNE:UPPER\n            SELI REGION DEV.INITIATIVE-PROMOTING SUST","majtheme":"Human development,Social protection and risk management,Environment and natural resource management,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"72859"},"facets":{}}}
