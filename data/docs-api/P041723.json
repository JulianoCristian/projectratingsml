Some lessons learned included:\n            effective implementation of reforms required a realistic\n            timeline to build capacity, consensus, and government\n            commitment. This process, which often takes more time than\n            expected, requires continuous policy dialogue. The\n            public-private partnership established for the new\n            irrigation financing mechanism is a good method of\n            increasing the area developed for irrigated agriculture.\n            This model should be extended to various actors in a more\n            cohesive manner. National Rural Infrastructure Project\n            (PNIR) investments should serve as a means of piloting a new\n            agricultural development model, characterized by new\n            modalities of access to land and water that will ultimately\n            make it possible to create an official market for land and\n            permit co financing of land settlement by beneficiaries. The\n            pilot undertaken for the project has demonstrated that, to\n            be effective, the package transferred to the private\n            producer must include completely finished plots (that is,\n            plots in which tertiary canals exist) as well as access to\n            credit, inputs, and extension advice. In addition, the study\n            of the irrigation funding mechanism and the pilot in\n            Koumouna showed that the Malian banking system is prepared\n            to finance land development when appropriate procedures are\n            in place and producers have clear title to their land.\n            However, this approach needs to be monitored and its impact\n            assessed with respect to: (i) the feasibility of collecting\n            the property tax on privatized land; and (ii) the risk of\n            land speculation and land ownership by a minority of people,\n            which will contradict the objective of reinforcing direct\n            farming by family businesses."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - National Rural Infrastructure Project\n

The\n            project has two 5-year phases and is supported through an\n            Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The project has five main\n            components in the first phase. The first component pilots a\n            capital cost recovery mechanism; promotes private irrigation\n            investments on large-scale schemes; improves irrigation\n            infrastructure management; and promotes cost reduction by\n            strengthening local private sector/nongovernmental\n            organizational capacity. The second component sets up an\n            autonomously managed road authority to conduct routine\n            maintenance on the main network and feeder roads; and\n            elaborates a national rural transport strategy. The third\n            component helps construct water supply and sanitation\n            facilities and provides community education activities. It\n            also provides training to construct on-site sanitation\n            systems for households, schools, and health centers; and\n            improves sanitation conditions and hygienic practices.

To offset some of the\n            expected negative impacts, regulatory actions, studies, and\n            actions are recommended.
