The\n            following lessons emerged from the experience of the\n            project. Conditionality in an adjustment operation: The\n            large number of conditions for project effectiveness and\n            second tranche release will need to be balanced with the\n            implementing capacity of the borrower. In Mongolia, this\n            presented a serious challenge to the government, and as\n            well, for maintaining the momentum and the continuous\n            attention it required, particularly in light of\n            Administration changes. This was reflected in the weak\n            capacity, and lack of information among government agencies.\n            This requires a technical assistance operation in capacity\n            building programs, to prepare the ground for, or a technical\n            assistance operation in parallel with, the adjustment\n            operation. A key to ensure fulfillment of tranche release\n            conditions is the Bank team/management's continuous\n            dialogue with the main stakeholders on the longer-term\n            benefits of difficult policy actions required by the\n            adjustment lending. In addition, an appropriate time frame\n            is required for the institution-building components,\n            particularly so in countries with weak civil service such as\n            Mongolia. The time frame required to introduce fundamental\n            changes in the financial and banking sectors, as well as for\n            institution building, requires better programming and\n            sequencing. Therefore, new institutions, once established,\n            would need continuing monitoring and improvement in order to\n            be effective in fulfilling their role in the financial sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mongolia - Financial Sector Adjustment\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mongolia - Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/03/5707890/mongolia-financial-sector-adjustment-credit-project","projn":"MN-Mongolia Financial Sector Adjustment\n            Credit -- P068071","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,National Governance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mongolia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050404130528"},"subsc":"Banking,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems,General industry and trade sector,Capital markets","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, accounting standards, ADB,\n            adverse effects, Agriculture, Asian Development Bank, asset\n            classification, Auditing, auditors, balance of payments,\n            bank assets, bank credit, bank failure, bank failure\n            resolution, bank failures, Bank Performance, Bank\n            privatization, Bank Restructuring, bank services, banking,\n            banking crisis, Banking Law, banking reform, banking\n            regulation, Banking Restructuring, banking sector, banking\n            services, banking supervision, banking system, Basle Core\n            Principles, benchmarks, Bonds, borrowing, cancellation,\n            capacity building, Capital Adequacy, capital flight, Capital\n            markets, CAR, Central Bank, central bank bills, central bank\n            interventions, commercial banks, competitiveness,\n            conditionality, consolidation, contract enforcement,\n            corporate governance, coupon rate, credit culture, credit\n            policies, CURRENCY, Current account, debt, debt management,\n            debt servicing, deficits, deposits, Development Projects,\n            earning assets, Economic Growth, enterprise/bank\n            restructuring, Exports, financial contracts, financial\n            crisis, financial infrastructure, financial institutions,\n            financial intermediation, Financial rate of return,\n            financial reporting, FINANCIAL SECTOR, FINANCIAL SECTOR\n            ADJUSTMENT, Financial Sector Development, Financial Sector\n            Reform, financial services, financial structure, financial\n            system, FISCAL YEAR, GDP, government bonds, Guidelines,\n            inflation, insolvency, insolvent banks, Institutional\n            Development, interest income, interest payments, interest\n            rate, interest rates, international banking, international\n            financial institutions, Key Performance Indicators/Log,\n            L/C/TF, laws, legal framework, legal infrastructure,\n            liquidation, liquidity, macroeconomic conditions,\n            macroeconomic management, macroeconomic stability,\n            macroeconomic stabilization, marketable securities,\n            maturity, mergers, monetary policies, MONGOLIA/BANK, net\n            interest margin, new entrants, operating expenses, Pacific\n            Region, Payment systems, portfolios, Present Value/Economic,\n            private banks, private commercial banks, privatization,\n            problem banks, profitability, Project Costs, prudential\n            regulations, prudential requirements, Real GDP, real sector,\n            regulatory framework, restructuring, risk evaluation, risk\n            management, Savings, securities clearance, settlement, small\n            banks, technical assistance, terms of trade, time deposits,\n            trade shocks, trading, trading system, treasury bills, value\n            added, Value/Economic rate of return, vulnerability"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.

The components include the establishment\n            of basic financial infrastructure, such as improved banking\n            skills, accounting standards, and clear policy framework\n            regarding bank failures; consolidation of the banking\n            system; divestiture of the Government's ownership in\n            the Trade and Development Bank; development of effective\n            regulation, and supervision of the financial system;\n            improvement of the payments system in rural areas; and,\n            confirmation of the government's commitment to honor\n            financial contracts, through a timely servicing of\n            Government bonds. Within the strategic framework, the\n            project will provide financial resources to Mongolia, and\n            avoid excessive transitional decline in consumption, and\n            investment practices, enabling a reasonable adjustment to\n            recent trade shocks. The economy will benefit from the\n            emergence of institutions, and markets, thus,\n            inter-mediation of financial resources will be ensured.\n            However, the outcome of the forthcoming parliamentary\n            elections may hinder ownership of the financial sector\n            program, and, the limitations within the administrative\n            capacity, may be
