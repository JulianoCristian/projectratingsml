It consists of actions in four areas: (a) resource\n            mobilization; (b) urban management; (c) promotion of\n            artisans and construction of industry; and (d) program\n            management. Specific actions under resource mobilization\n            would include the introduction of a property tax and\n            improved financial management. Support would also be given\n            to the Inter-Communal Development Credit agency (CID).\n            Actions to promote better urban management consist primarily\n            of strengthening the capacity of communes in major cities\n            and towns to maintain infrastructure and improve land\n            tenure.
