The primary project outcome is confirmation of\n            the feasibility of developing mechanisms for decentralized\n            implementation of relatively large projects that call for a\n            high degree of community participation in design,\n            implementation, and operation. The project exceeded all the\n            physical targets agreed at appraisal. However,\n            sustainability is rated as uncertain at this time. Due in\n            part to the innovative and evolving nature of the delivery\n            mechanism tested, it is concluded that considerable\n            sustained efforts would be required to achieve project\n            sustainability. Both World Bank and Borrower performances\n            are rated satisfactory. Key lessons learned include the\n            following: The decentralized community-based development\n            strategy requires further refinement and consolidation.\n            Community-based organizations need intensive training and\n            awareness raising. Re-allocation of technical assistance\n            funds for physical works should be avoided. Strong financial\n            management and controls in community-based projects are\n            essential. Consistency is needed between government policies\n            and programs and (International Development Association) IDA\n            programs to ensure similarity in approach and financing\n            terms. Projects with a high degree of community\n            participation require long-term sustained support of sector\n            development objectives, and IDA's commitment should not\n            be affected by project implementation challenges."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka - Community Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sri Lanka - Community Water\n            Supply and Sanitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728435/sri-lanka-community-water-supply-sanitation-project","projn":"LK-Community Wat Supp/S -- P010409","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Health Economics & Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Sri Lanka","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99082405303364"},"subsc":"Other social services,Sub-national government administration,Water supply,Health,Sanitation","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"asset management,capacity building,community\n            contribution,community groups,community leaders,community\n            organizations,community ownership,community\n            participation,Community Water,Community Water\n            Supply,construction,cost recovery,delivery of water\n            supply,environmental\n            impacts,expenditures,hand-pumps,households,hygiene,hygiene\n            education,institutionalization,intermediaries,investment\n            program,iron,learning process,local government\n            framework,maintenance of assets,maintenance of\n            water,management of water,managers,managing water\n            supply,media,National Water Supply,non- governmental\n            organizations,non-governmental organizations,participatory\n            approaches,project management,public health,quality of\n            life,rural water,Rural water schemes,rural water\n            supply,sanitation component,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            investment,Sanitation Investments,sanitation\n            sector,sanitation services,schools,service delivery,service\n            delivery mechanisms,small towns,social capital,social\n            mobilization,sustainable services,sustainable\n            water,sustainable water supply,tariff\n            setting,toilets,towns,urban water,urban water supply,use of\n            water,washing,water infrastructure,water sanitation,water\n            schemes,water sources,wells,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"asset management,capacity building,community\n            contribution,community groups,community leaders,community\n            organizations,community ownership,community\n            participation,Community Water,Community Water\n            Supply,construction,cost recovery,delivery of water\n            supply,environmental\n            impacts,expenditures,hand-pumps,households,hygiene,hygiene\n            education,institutionalization,intermediaries,investment\n            program,iron,learning process,local government\n            framework,maintenance of assets,maintenance of\n            water,management of water,managers,managing water\n            supply,media,National Water Supply,non- governmental\n            organizations,non-governmental organizations,participatory\n            approaches,project management,public health,quality of\n            life,rural water,Rural water schemes,rural water\n            supply,sanitation component,sanitation facilities,sanitation\n            investment,Sanitation Investments,sanitation\n            sector,sanitation services,schools,service delivery,service\n            delivery mechanisms,small towns,social capital,social\n            mobilization,sustainable services,sustainable\n            water,sustainable water supply,tariff\n            setting,toilets,towns,urban water,urban water supply,use of\n            water,washing,water infrastructure,water sanitation,water\n            schemes,water sources,wells,workers"}},"owner":"Energy (SASDE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF026355-SIDA GRANT TO WSP (EXPENSE A/C\n            AS OF 12/31/97),TF025007-UNDP-WB: WATER & SANITATION PROGRAM,TF021651-DANISH GRANT TO WSP FOR S.

Women's\n            involvement in system management is critical for performance\n            (as the primary water collectors in most rural households,\n            women have the most interest in ensuring that the water and\n            sanitation service is designed to match their needs and\n            performs well). The study finds that project designers need\n            to pay close attention to existing levels of social capital\n            in communities, and adjust the approach to service delivery\n            accordingly. In communities with low levels of social\n            capital, special efforts may be necessary to motivate and\n            mobilize community members. Policy recommendations include\n            the advisability of respecting beneficiary aspirations for\n            high standards of service. Maximizing house connections and\n            yard taps both fulfill community aspirations and creates the\n            possibility of collecting enough money through fees and\n            tariffs to make a local water committee worthwhile. Factors\n            such as water committee participation in multiple community,\n            participation in system design and construction, improved\n            beneficiary health, and women's participation in the\n            water group are all positively related to above-average\n            financial management and cost recovery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sri Lanka -Community Water Supply
