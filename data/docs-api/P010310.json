The project\n            achieved its main objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, participation of beneficiaries in the\n            design, construction, implementation, and O&M from the\n            outset is very important, especially in large public\n            irrigation systems. Second, service charges to cover full\n            O&M costs of public utilities after improvement must be\n            imposed and considered as a national policy in any\n            investment project. Third, economic analysis before\n            implementation of FMIS sub-projects was often inadequate.\n            HMGN must take steps to ensure rigorous appraisal of future\n            schemes' viability. Fourth, it is not reasonable to\n            expect increased agricultural extension input from the DADO\n            if additional resources are not allocated to DADO for this\n            purpose. Finally, the WUA's responsibility for the\n            O&M of new schemes must be carefully and clearly defined\n            at the outset."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Second Mahakali Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Second Mahakali\n            Irrigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/09/732187/nepal-second-mahakali-irrigation-project","projn":"NP-Mahakali Irrig.
