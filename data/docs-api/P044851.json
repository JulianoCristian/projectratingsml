Two main\n            lessons learned address: a) a positive feature of project\n            design was that during the implementation of the project,\n            the Bank combined a bottom up approach with top down\n            pressures, aimed at improving the banking sector performance\n            at the level of individual banks, as well as through a\n            system of improved regulation and supervision, and better\n            legal and accounting environment. The top down approach was\n            pursued through extensive technical assistance and\n            adjustment lending, particularly in the areas of the\n            National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) regulation and supervision of\n            banks, accounting reform, and the reform of the collateral\n            law; b) major prerequisites for the successful project\n            implementation were the requirement, and the program for\n            institutional development of EXIM - State Export Import Bank\n            of Ukraine - as a participating financial institution. Thus,\n            project implementation not only provided EXIM with the funds\n            for expanding its intermediary capacity, but more\n            importantly, built-in incentives and provided necessary\n            mechanisms for strengthening the Bank's financial and\n            operational performance. The complementary technical\n            assistance (TA), in addition to loan funds, allowed\n            tailoring TA to the needs of EXIM, including being supported\n            with capital investments, which brought prompt, more\n            sustainable results, and increased synergy in using loan and\n            TA resources. Further lessons address compliance with the\n            covenants entailed in the Loan agreement, recommending that\n            free limits for credit line disbursements be defined on the\n            basis of total exposure towards any one customer, and, that\n            the Bank allow sub-borrowing enterprises to use commercial\n            practices, provided local legislation lays the foundation\n            for basic procurement principles, with enterprises\n            undergoing training in the area of procurement. It is worth\n            noting that according to international best practices, one\n            of the best ways to reduce credit risk is to broaden the\n            appropriate credit product range. For example, permitting a\n            finance lease scheme might have ensured EXIM the possibility\n            to retain the ownership of the equipment. Leasing was not\n            permitted under the existing loan agreement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ukraine - Export Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ukraine - Export Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/01/5610032/ukraine-export-development-project","projn":"UA-Export Development Project -- P044851","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Ukraine","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050217131739"},"subsc":"Banking,General industry and trade sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting, adverse selection, agriculture,\n            auditing, auditors, audits, balance sheet, Bank Management,\n            Bank Performance, bank regulation, banking institutions,\n            banking sector, banking system, banks, bonds, borrowing,\n            Cabinet of Ministers, capacity building, capital adequacy,\n            certificates, collateral, commercial banks, competitiveness,\n            conditionality, confidentiality, Consumer credit,\n            consumption rates, corporate governance, counterpart, credit\n            policy, credit risk, CURRENCY, currency exchange, current\n            account, debt, decision making, Deposit Insurance, deposits,\n            development strategy, disbursements, dumping, economic\n            growth, economic reform, Economic Relations, economic\n            situation, exchange rates, Expenditures, export barriers,\n            export growth, Export Insurance, exports, exposure,\n            financial crises, financial intermediation, financial\n            management, financial performance, financial performance\n            indicators, financial planning, financial products,\n            Financial rate of return, financial resources, Financial\n            Sector, Financial Sector Adjustment, financial sector\n            reform, financial services, FISCAL YEAR, foreign currency,\n            foreign exchange, GDP, income, inflation, insider lending,\n            institutional capacity, Institutional Development, interest\n            rate, international accounting standards, international\n            clearing, investment projects, ISO, labor markets, Leasing,\n            legislation, liability, liability management, liquidation,\n            liquidity, living standards, Loan Classification, loan\n            documentation, macroeconomic conditions, management,\n            management information systems, maturity, multiplier\n            effects, Organizational structure, portfolio, private\n            investment, Private Sector, privatization, procurement,\n            Project Costs, prudential requirements, real sector, risk\n            management, Savings, securitization, small banks, Sovereign\n            Risk, State banks, suppliers, Swift, T-bills, tax reform,\n            taxation, Technical Assistance, Tier 2 capital, trade\n            finance, trade liberalization, transaction costs, transition\n            economies, transparency, transport, trust funds, unemployment"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Financial Intermediary Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF021274-PHRD 2-INST.DEV.
