Some lessons\n            learned included: i) financial covenants should be used\n            flexibly enough, so that, under a changing\n            financial/business environment, they can be revised\n            expeditiously in order not to create unnecessary\n            difficulties; ii) the Bank should have alerted the\n            authorities at an early stage regarding the inadequate basis\n            for pricing natural gas at the well head under the present\n            regulatory framework; iii) when a Borrower is really\n            motivated to undertake reforms, these can be achieved over a\n            relatively short time span provided that the external\n            environment is also favorable; and iv) the project was a\n            proper vehicle to introduce policy reforms and operational\n            concepts as used by international oil companies. However the\n            Bank should not have pursued broader sectoral pricing\n            objectives (beyond oil and gas) under a petroleum project.\n            These covenants proved
