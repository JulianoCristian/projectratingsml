The overall performances\n            of both the Bank and the Borrower is rated satisfactory. As\n            in the first Private Sector Development Project (PSD1), the\n            main lessons learned from the PSD II relate to measures that\n            could be adopted at project design to strengthen project\n            implementation. They include recommendations regarding: (i)\n            the inclusion of technical assistance components in credit\n            lines approved in transition economies if long-term lending\n            skills are largely underdeveloped in their banking systems;\n            (ii) the establishment of independent implementation units\n            with a formal agency arrangement; and (iii) choosing prudent\n            banks capable of offering their clients a range of\n            good-quality products and services. The selection criteria\n            should rely largely on the sovereign prudential requirements\n            as long as these have been deemed acceptable to the Bank.\n            Other points elaborated in this ICR include: 1) The Bank\n            should have a clear position on the level of interest rates\n            to be offered to the financial intermediaries and final\n            borrowers on its credit line funds. This position needs to\n            take into account the fact that, in many countries which\n            take out financial intermediary loans from the Bank, there\n            are very few, if any, long-term funding sources in the\n            financial system and no yield curves to speak of, thus\n            rendering the pricing of such loans a discretionary matter\n            agreed between the Bank and the Borrower (usually the\n            Ministry of Finance). As a development institution, the Bank\n            should consider passing along its low borrowing costs, not\n            only to the official Borrowers but as an incentive also to\n            the private sector participants. Continued availability of\n            these long-term funds would catalyze the provision of\n            medium- and long-term credits to private sector enterprises\n            at reasonable rates, which would contribute to private\n            sector-led growth. 2) Arrangements for usage of the repaid\n            (revolving) funds after a project's formal closure\n            should be agreed up front and ideally allow the funds to\n            flow back into the participating financial intermediaries\n            (PFIs) without strict conditions attached. 3) With regard to\n            the conditions for using the funds during the project,\n            procurement procedures continue to be perceived as too\n            cumbersome by private sector enterprises. To this end,\n            although the Bank has made substantial progress in\n            simplifying it's procurement guidelines for private\n            sector beneficiaries, attempts should be made to further\n            streamline these procedures for the private sector without\n            undermining the fiduciary responsibilities of the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia -

Its principal objectives are\n            to: a) promote private sector growth and create conditions\n            for an effective supply response from viable private\n            enterprises and farmers; b) facilitate the banking sector\n            transformation and integration into international financial\n            markets; and c) stimulate credit market competition. At the\n            level of individual banks, the project aims to provide\n            hands-on-assistance for institutional strengthening and the\n            adoption of safe and sound banking practices. The project\n            will contribute to reversing the country's economy\n            decline and to increase the private sector share in the\n            economy. The project consists of a single private enterprise\n            finance component, consisting of a credit line to be\n            intermediated by a number of participating financial\n            intermediaries (PFI). Six PFIs have been already qualified\n            under the PSD 1 and an additional three banks are expected\n            to be able to meet qualification criteria in the near\n            future. The subloans under the credit line will be extended\n            for investment and working capital finance of eligible\n            private enterprises for eligible subprojects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Second Private Sector\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia - Second Private Sector\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/10/693997/macedonia-second-private-sector-development-project","projn":"MK-Private Sector Development 2 Project -- P034609","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Health Economics & Finance,Financial Intermediation,Housing Finance","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Macedonia, former Yugoslav Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980420171124"},"subsc":"General industry and trade sector,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting practices,Accounting\n            records,Agricultural Credit,asset\n            management,auditing,auditors,audits,Bank Supervision,banking\n            risks,banking sector,banking sector reforms,banking\n            supervision,banking system,banks,capital adequacy,capital\n            loans,capital markets,credit line,credit markets,credit\n            risk,demonstration effects,Development\n            Indicators,Disbursement,domestic credit,employment,equity\n            capital,Equity Investment,Expenditures,external\n            auditors,financial covenants,Financial\n            Infrastructure,financial institutions,Financial\n            Intermediaries,financial markets,financial\n            policies,financial reporting,Financial Sector,Financial\n            Sector Development,financial services,financial\n            statements,FISCAL YEAR,foreign banks,foreign\n            exchange,income,insurance,Interest rates,internal\n            audits,international standards,key performance\n            indicators,legislation,loan classification,loan\n            supervision,management information systems,market\n            transparency,maturities,private banks,Private\n            Sector,Privatization,profitability,Project\n            Financing,prudential regulations,risk management,risk\n            profile,Sensitivity analysis,service delivery,Structural\n            Adjustment,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting practices,Accounting\n            records,Agricultural Credit,asset\n            management,auditing,auditors,audits,Bank Supervision,banking\n            risks,banking sector,banking sector reforms,banking\n            supervision,banking system,banks,capital adequacy,capital\n            loans,capital markets,credit line,credit markets,credit\n            risk,demonstration effects,Development\n            Indicators,Disbursement,domestic credit,employment,equity\n            capital,Equity Investment,Expenditures,external\n            auditors,financial covenants,Financial\n            Infrastructure,financial institutions,Financial\n            Intermediaries,financial markets,financial\n            policies,financial reporting,Financial Sector,Financial\n            Sector Development,financial services,financial\n            statements,FISCAL YEAR,foreign banks,foreign\n            exchange,income,insurance,Interest rates,internal\n            audits,international standards,key performance\n            indicators,legislation,loan classification,loan\n            supervision,management information systems,market\n            transparency,maturities,private banks,Private\n            Sector,Privatization,profitability,Project\n            Financing,prudential regulations,risk management,risk\n            profile,Sensitivity analysis,service delivery,Structural\n            Adjustment,subsidiary,Technical Assistance,working capital"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF025226-PHRD-ECONOMIC RECOVERY LOAN II,TF038147-MACEDONIA, FYR FESAL II,TF031974-FYR - MACEDONIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR,TF031972-FYR MACEDONIA - FINANCIAL SECTOR,TF031298-FYR-MACEDONIA - INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING,TF029305-PHRD-PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT II,TF035235-MACEDONIA - PRIVATE SECTOR\n            DEVELOPMENT II,TF029115-PHRD-POST PRIV.
