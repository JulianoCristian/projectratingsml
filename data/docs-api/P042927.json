In the flooded section of Dong Ha - Quang\n            Ngai, 3,582 PAPs are affected, mostly by loss of\n            agricultural land.

A detailed measurement survey (DMS) and\n            census and a socio-economic survey were conducted on the\n            project affected persons (PAPs).

In the flooded section of Dong Ha - Quang\n            Ngai, 3,582 PAPs are affected, mostly by loss of\n            agricultural land.
