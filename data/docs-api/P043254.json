Some lessons learned included: in\n            health projects where usually the public sector operates\n            under many constraints (particularly the lack of incentives\n            for civil servants), strong leadership at the highest level\n            of the ministry is essential to ensure satisfactory\n            implementation and operation of the projects. In an\n            environment of weak institutional capacity, the design of a\n            project must be simple, realistic and consistent with the\n            government's capacity to implement it. Technical\n            ministries like the ministry of health should concentrate\n            their energy and activities on purely sectoral matters and\n            issues and delegate the carrying out of civil works to\n            agencies specialized in those activities, such as Public\n            Works Project (PWP). At the same time, agencies like PWP\n            need to expand their capacity to respond to the demand for\n            their service to ensure further quality and timeliness of\n            their delivery. A vertical program versus a system approach\n            is a complex issue. In a context of burning need for quick\n            health outcomes, working through vertical programs could\n            achieve quick health outcomes while building implementation\n            capacity and should be designed to ensure gradual building\n            of a change management platform. Renovating and equipping\n            health facilities and training medical staff could turn out\n            to be a total loss of resources if adequate budgets are not\n            made available for operation and maintenance. Ensuring a\n            satisfactory utilization of the available capacity of health\n            facilities may also require improvements in the management\n            of these facilities so that the population is encouraged to\n            use them. Special efforts must be made to ensure\n            satisfactory design and drawings of utilities and waste\n            management systems and to sensitize end-users for better\n            management of liquid and solid waste, including medical waste."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen - Health Reform Support\n            Project (HRSP)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic

The second\n            component improves the effectiveness of public health\n            programs by strengthening two critical programs, namely,\n            malaria and health education. It finances civil works for\n            minor renovations of referral laboratories, proivides\n            equipment and supplies for laboratories and vector control\n            and disease surveillance, computers and vehicles, emergency\n            stocks of essential drugs and insecticide treated materials,\n            staff training, etc. The third component supports human\n            resources development in the areas of financial analysis and\n            health systems management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen - Health Reform Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Republic of Yemen - Health Reform\n            Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/03/1725281/republic-yemen-health-reform-support-project","projn":"RY-Health Reform Support Project (Hrsp) -- P043254","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Yemen, Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02031504141247"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility,basic health services,basic\n            services,beds,burden of disease,cancer,Child\n            Development,Child Health Services,communicable\n            diseases,communities,contraceptives,deaths,decentralization,decision\n            making,districts,Epidemiology,equipment,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,family planning,Financial\n            Management,gender,girls,health care,health centers,health\n            education,health facilities,Health Finance,health\n            indicators,health interventions,Health outcomes,health\n            programs,Health Reform,Health Sector,health status,Health\n            System,health systems,health systems management,hospital\n            autonomy,hospitals,Immunization,Infant Mortality,Infant\n            Mortality Rate,injuries,Integrated Management of Childhood\n            Illnesses,integration,Intervention,laboratories,Malaria,malnutrition,medical\n            equipment,medical\n            supplies,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,patients,performance\n            indicators,Poverty Reduction,pregnancy,Primary Health\n            Care,primary schools,private sector,Public Health,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,rural areas,Sexually Transmitted\n            Diseases,sexually transmitted\n            infections,supervision,Sustainability,urban areas"},"1":{"cdata!":"accessibility,basic health services,basic\n            services,beds,burden of disease,cancer,Child\n            Development,Child Health Services,communicable\n            diseases,communities,contraceptives,deaths,decentralization,decision\n            making,districts,Epidemiology,equipment,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,family planning,Financial\n            Management,gender,girls,health care,health centers,health\n            education,health facilities,Health Finance,health\n            indicators,health interventions,Health outcomes,health\n            programs,Health Reform,Health Sector,health status,Health\n            System,health systems,health systems management,hospital\n            autonomy,hospitals,Immunization,Infant Mortality,Infant\n            Mortality Rate,injuries,Integrated Management of Childhood\n            Illnesses,integration,Intervention,laboratories,Malaria,malnutrition,medical\n            equipment,medical\n            supplies,morbidity,Mortality,mothers,patients,performance\n            indicators,Poverty Reduction,pregnancy,Primary Health\n            Care,primary schools,private sector,Public Health,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,rural areas,Sexually Transmitted\n            Diseases,sexually transmitted\n            infections,supervision,Sustainability,urban areas"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"trustfund":"TF029657-PHRD-DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE TO\n            THE POOR,TF039842-YEMEN REPUBLIC - HEALTH SECTOR REFORM,TF039840-YEMEN REBUBLIC - HEALTH SECTOR REFORM.,TF037559-YEMEN - HEALTH SECTOR,TF037378-YEMEN - HEALTH SECTOR,TF037346-YEMEN, REPUBLIC OF - CHILD DEVELOPMENT,TF036950-YEMEN, PEOPLE'S DEM.

For these\n            reasons, the Ministry of Health has taken initiatives to\n            address environmental issues associated with hospitals, and\n            health clinics, and, in participation among the\n            country's existing agencies, the Bank - based on its\n            environmental policy guidelines, and technical assistance\n            provisions - supports this environmental management plan\n            (EMP) and the following mitigation measures. The\n            rehabilitation design of hospitals, and health centers will\n            take into account the generation of hazardous wastes, which\n            should comply with safe collection, and disposal measures,\n            while related staff should receive training to ensure\n            compliance, as prescribed by the operations manual that sets\n            the procedures, and protocols that govern the work place.\n            Moreover, an environmental impact assessment will be\n            implemented for each hospital and clinic, to determine the\n            feasibility of either off-site or on-site disposal. This\n            entails consideration of incinerators for on-site disposal\n            of contaminated wastes, ensuring air pollution control, or,\n            disposal at existing municipal facilities. Selected waste\n            disposal sites will be located for wastes that should not\n            undergo incineration, in cooperation with the local EPA.\n            Likewise solid wastes would be disposed of at selected\n            sites, or recycled as possible.

The report is divided in nine sections.\n            Section A provides the introduction to the report and the\n            country context. Sections B and C review the key health\n            indicators and trends and the key aspects of the sector in\n            terms of financing, service delivery, human resources,\n            health services, organizational framework, and policy\n            environment.

Section F is an outline of the\n            MOPH/HSR program. Sections G and H provide an overview of\n            the Bank's current assistance and its response to HSR\n            as well as the different donors' support. Finally,\n            Section I outlines the future areas where the Bank can\n            support the government in its health reform efforts. Yemen\n            faces major challenges to improving the health status of its\n            population, which go beyond the health delivery network.\n            Poverty, low participation in education especially among\n            girls, and high illiteracy are major contributing factors to\n            poor health as are limited access to potable water and\n            proper
