Some lessons learned\n            included: the success of the PRDP DPG has provided a number\n            of important lessons for future Bank operations. First and\n            foremost is that for budget support operations to be\n            successful, they must support the Government's agenda\n            and not an agenda imposed from outside. The DPG directly\n            supported the PRDP that was formulated by the Palestinian\n            Authority (PA) after extensive consultations with a wide\n            variety of stakeholders including government agencies, civil\n            society and donors. Thus, there has been strong buy in from\n            all parties and the reforms supported by the DPG have been\n            successfully implemented. The success can be traced to the\n            realistic scope and timing of the reform agenda. The\n            Palestinians are attempting to build a state from scratch\n            while under occupation. There is an extensive agenda of\n            pressing reforms. However, the PA has only a limited ability\n            to implement reforms. Thus, the PA, in consultation with\n            donors, has narrowed their efforts to the most critical\n            reforms that are also attainable. As the reform process\n            progresses and the Government builds strength, the agenda\n            will become more ambitious. Reaching too far, too fast,\n            could doom the reform process. Thus, successful policy\n            lending must take into account the political realities faced\n            by the government and requires careful timing and targeting\n            of critical reforms. Another clear lesson has been the\n            importance of having the Bank's task team resident in\n            the WBG country office. In fragile and conflict states, the\n            situation is constantly changing and government priorities\n            shift rapidly. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a\n            constant dialogue with government counterparts, which\n            requires the task team to be present in the country. The\n            previous budget support operation in WBG suffered because it\n            was managed from headquarters."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Palestinian Reform and\n

This plan was developed internally by\n            the Caretaker Government, with limited input from the donor\n            community. The plan reflects the Caretaker Government's\n            belief that it must move aggressively to control the budget\n            and quit accumulating arrears. It takes advantage of the\n            goodwill and high level of donor support pledged at the\n            Paris Donor Conference in December 2007. To have the largest\n            impact, the project focuses on two specific areas: (i)\n            strengthening the PA's fiscal position; and (ii)\n            improving public financial management. These are critical\n            building blocks for the government of an independent\n            Palestinian state and are also crucial for attracting\n            continued international donor support. The Bank's\n            involvement in supporting and monitoring the reform agenda\n            described in the attached policy matrix will strengthen the\n            PA's capacity to achieve the desired reforms and also\n            help build the required support among donors. The Bank will\n            support the PRDP process in two complementary ways: (i) it\n            has established the PRDP Trust Fund as requested by the PA;\n            and (ii) will provide the proposed development policy grant.\n            The project can boost economic growth, establish good\n            governance, increase private sector development, and improve\n            social and public infrastructure. The PA has made\n            significant progress in building institutions, including\n            passing some of the most progressive economic and social\n            laws in the Arab world and conducting peaceful free and fair elections."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Palestinian Reform and\n            Development Plan Development Policy
