The objectives were to provide services and\n            equipment related to restoring effective competition in\n            domestic banking, improving the regulatory framework and\n            Central Bank supervision of the banking system, further\n            rationalization of the social security system, improved tax\n            administration, and more comprehensive public investment\n            programming. In line with SAL II's focus on the\n            solution of commercial bank problems, the bulk of\n            TALII's project costs were originally directed at the\n            financial sector component. The Project helped set the\n            framework for some useful changes in the areas of its main\n            objectives. The social security subproject helped BPS\n            modernize its revenue collection system and thereby has\n            helped reduce evasion. The OPP unit created under the public\n            sector programming and investment component provided the\n            Government with necessary information for planning,\n            coordination, implementation of projects and budget\n            allocation decisions. Finally, two insolvent banks were\n            reprivatized under the restructuring component. Ratings for\n            the Bank and Borrower performance were unsatisfactory.  Some\n            of the key lesson learned included:  Uruguay's public\n            sector finances long ago entered a state of structural\n            crisis that will take many years to overcome. The progress\n            achieved to date suggests that comprehensive public\n            administration reform needs more attention than has so far\n            been devoted to it.  The continuing support of both of\n            Uruguay's main political parties for the thrust of the\n            reforms at issue here improves the likelihood of future\n            pursuit of the adjustment program goals. Moreover,\n            experience indicates that the measures which TAL-type\n            projects seek to advance stand far better chances of\n            achieving lasting solutions in Uruguay's environment\n            (once consensus is built up) than in more volatile countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay - Second Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Uruguay -
