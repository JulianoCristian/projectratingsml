Some lessons learned includes: lack of\n            realism and phasing in a project design and implementation\n            in a conflict or post-conflict country can undermine the\n            project ability to achieve its development objectives. This\n            project undertook to cover the entire country after a\n            conflict which left the country with weak institutional\n            systems. Identification of some hotspots along with\n            concentrating efforts in limited number of easily accessible\n            provinces may have increased the chance of the project to\n            achieve its development objectives. In a post-conflict\n            country, swift and frequent restructuring exercises may be\n            necessary in order to adapt the project design and\n            implementation as the situation changes and new data become\n            available. Strict adherence to global project frameworks can\n            undermine undertaking necessary adjustments to adapt a\n            project to the specific situation of a particular country.\n            Frameworks such as MAP, Avian Influenza, and food crisis\n            present the advantage that once the Board has approve the\n            framework, then it become easy to expedite project. In a\n            country with particularly weak capacity, it is imperative to\n            have a Task Team Leader (TTL) in the field at the onset of\n            the project and avoid frequent TTL changes. It takes at\n            least one full year for a TTL to better understand a project\n            in depth and therefore an additional couple of years at\n            least are needed to ensure continuity and smooth\n            implementation of the project. Similarly, in weak capacity\n            environments, the Bank needs to exercise intense fiduciary\n            oversight even when international firms have been hired to\n            provide fiduciary services. Donor driven projects from the\n            beginning to the end without proper incremental integration\n            into the Government budget processes poses a substantial\n            risk to the sustainability of development outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo, Democratic Republic of -\n            Multisectoral HIV/AIDS Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/11/15664814/congo-democratic-republic-multisectoral-hivaids-project","projn":"ZR-Drc  Multisectoral Hiv/Aids Project -- P082516","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Pharmaceuticals & Pharmacoeconomics,Poverty Assessment,Health Economics & Finance,Poverty Monitoring & Analysis","teratopic":"Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000386194_20120124232557"},"subsc":"Health,Sub-national government administration,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Poverty Reduction,Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural extension,audiences,basic\n            needs,beneficiaries,capacity building,civil\n            society,communicable diseases,community\n            development,community level,corrective measures,cost\n            recovery,country context,Currency Unit,data\n            collection,delivery mechanisms,development\n            programs,Discrimination,donor community,Drugs,Economic\n            growth,evaluation activities,Exchange Rate,extreme\n            poverty,families,health problem,health sector,health\n            status,health survey,Hepatitis B,Immunodeficiency,impact\n            evaluation,income,Institutional arrangements,institutional\n            framework,intervention,local level,local levels,medical\n            services,medical treatment,Monitoring &\n            Evaluation,monitoring system,national level,NGO,operating\n            costs,outcome indicators,Partnership,per capita\n            income,population groups,Poverty Reduction,Poverty Reduction\n            Strategy,Primary education,Private\n            sector,Procurement,productive sectors,professional\n            associations,programs,Project Implementation,project\n            management,public enterprises,public health,public\n            institutions,public sector,qualitative instruments,quality\n            control,Quality of Life,reducing poverty,resource\n            allocation,Safety,screening,service providers,sex\n            workers,Social Development,social\n            services,STDs,targeting,Task Team Leader,technical\n            capacity,technical skills,technical support,urban\n            areas,vulnerable groups,WasteHIV AIDS; Epidemic diseases;\n            HIV AIDS infections; Socioeconomic impacts; Vulnerable\n            groups; Public institutions; Public enterprises;\n            Nongovernmental organizations; Project implementation; Rural\n            areas; Urban areas; Procurement; Lending; Community\n            initiatives; Monitoring & evaluation arrangements;\n            Communication; Partnership; Sustainability; Economic\n            analysis; Financial analysis; Technical assistance;\n            Environmental issues; Social aspects; Safeguard policies; Lending"}},"owner":"Hlth, Nutr & Pop.

This will be achieved\n            by: (i) Reducing the risk of sexual, intravenous and\n            vertical transmission of HIV; (ii) Improving the health\n            status and quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS;\n            and (iii) Mitigating the socio-economic impact of the\n            epidemic on vulnerable groups. The project has the following\n            four components: Component 1) the project will assist and\n            support the mobilization of public institutions in the fight\n            against this epidemic by mainstreaming HIV/AIDS activities\n            in their regular work program. Activities by public sector\n            institutions on behalf of their staff and families, as well\n            as their clients will be financed on a competitive basis.\n            Component 2) The project will support HIV/AIDS activities\n            proposed by the HIV/AIDS Inter-Enterprise Committee (CIELS).\n            CIELS is an umbrella organization for private sector\n            entities and public enterprises and will serve as an\n            interface and coordinate the preparation and submission of\n            proposals by member enterprises at the national, provincial,\n            and local levels. Non-governmental and faith-based\n            organizations will be mobilized and supported to help\n            implement the national strategic plan supported by this\n            project. Component 3) A 'community' will be\n            understood as any human group mobilized around a common\n            interest. A community may be a village, a neighborhood, a\n            school or any local association. The component's\n            objective is to increase the impact of HIV/AIDS activities\n            by transferring the responsibility for identifying\n            priorities, and preparing and implementing micro-projects\n            directly to the beneficiaries in rural and urban areas.\n            Component 4) The National Coordination Unit (NCU) will be\n            responsible for coordinating the overall implementation of\n            the program. The National Coordination Unit NCU will be\n            decentralized at the provincial (Provincial Coordination\n            Units) and local (Local Coordination Units)
