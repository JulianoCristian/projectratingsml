The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory\n            because, despite implementation delays, the most significant\n            components of the loan (in terms of value and priority\n            assigned in the SAR) were mostly achieved. The main findings\n            of this project are: 1) The project would have benefited\n            from better pipeline preparation by appraisal; 2) The\n            experience of low demand from the previous loan was not\n            fully internalized in project design; 3) Project risks were\n            not fully recognized; 4) The TA component for CETESB was\n            successful although its full potential was not achieved. The\n            project offers the following lessons: a) Define specific\n            environmental quality objectives, link enforcement actions\n            and performance indicators more closely; b) Use credit more\n            selectively; c) Recognize coverage limitations of credit;\n            and d) Recognize other forms of assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
