These projects are reviewed together because all\n            three dealt with aspects of public sector financial\n            management (PFM). However, the TA project and the SAC also\n            addressed many other policy and institutional issues. All\n            three projects suffered from flaws in project design and\n            supervision, and weak government commitment to certain\n            project objectives. The TA project and the D&R project\n            outcomes were rated unsatisfactory in Implementation\n            Completion Report (ICRs) and ICR reviews, and the SAC\n            outcome was rated unsatisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower was also rated moderately\n            unsatisfactory for TA and SAC, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower for D&R is rated moderately\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned from the projects are: (i)\n            a substantial share of donor aid to Cambodia has been\n            allocated to TA, but results have been generally\n            disappointing. Too much TA has been donor-driven without\n            adequate Government involvement. This is changing in the\n            Bank-led support for the Public Financial Management Reform\n            Program (PFMRP); (ii) all three projects suffered from flaws\n            in project design. The TA project and the SAC were overly\n            broad in attempting to resolve too many problems through a\n            single operation. The SAC had an excessive number of\n            conditions which delayed effectiveness and tranche releases.\n            The D&R project failed to heed the public complaints\n            about falsification of the number of military personnel and\n            corruption in handling the military payroll; (iii) the Bank\n            was unrealistic in its assessment of the Government's\n            commitment to many of the reforms in public administration\n            and governance supported by these projects; (iv) the Bank\n            should have carried out more intensive supervision of\n            fiduciary issues in the International Development\n            Association (IDA) portfolio. However, after the findings\n            that led the Bank to declare misprocurement in the D&R\n            project, the subsequent fiduciary review and the ensuing\n            World Bank Department of Institutional Integrity (INT)\n            investigations, the Bank has now taken appropriate steps to\n            address these problems; and (v) the Bank delayed for almost\n            ten years before building up an adequate field office\n            presence, contrary to the lessons of experience in\n            post-conflict countries. This had an adverse effect on the\n            Bank's ability to supervise complex projects, to\n            maintain regular contact with government officials, and to\n            work effectively with other donors. This deficiency has been\n            corrected since 2003."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Technical Assistance Project;\n            Structural Adjustment Credit; and Demobilization and\n

The project was implemented\n            during a period of political uncertainty and instability in\n            Cambodia. Lessons learned from the project include: The\n            coverage on technical assistance is too broad, making the\n            project unwieldy for the Bank in performing effective\n            supervision and implementation and for the government to\n            manage and monitor. Careful assessment of the capacity of\n            new borrowers in the preparation and implementation of\n            projects is much needed. Ownership of the project resided\n            with the senior officials but was not transparent among the\n            officials who were to implement the project. For a technical\n            assistance, the emphasis should be appropriate in short\n            term, medium, and long terms. The borrower's\n            unfamiliarity with the Bank's processes and procedures\n            was underestimated. Lengthy period of implementation brings\n            about the question of project sustainability. Effective\n            communication, dialogue, and consensus building with the\n            borrower is needed. The Bank needs to implement strictly its\n            policy of non-payments of allowances. Salaries for\n            consultants need to be uniform and consistent with their\n            skills and knowledge. The Bank needs to tighten supervision\n            and monitoring of the foreign consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Techncial Assistance Credit
