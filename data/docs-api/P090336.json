Some lessons learned includes: it\n            is possible to successfully restore lost wetlands. At the\n            time of appraisal, the wetlands in the project area had all\n            but disappeared. With the introduction of appropriate\n            ecological measures, nature is capable of reviving itself\n            within a relatively short period even in a highly developed\n            urban area. Constructed wetlands can be used for enhanced\n            treatment of wastewater. The NWEP and Global Environment\n            Facility (GEF) projects together demonstrated the\n            feasibility of nitrogen removal using the simple and\n            effective technique of wetlands. The project has also\n            demonstrated the importance of appropriate design for\n            constructed wetlands. The prevailing thinking about\n            'wetlands' was large water surfaces with some\n            plants along the edges, that maybe aesthetically pleasing\n            but have minimal treatment functions. Thorough institutional\n            analysis is required for the design of effective\n            implementation arrangements. A key shortcoming of the\n            project was inadequate assessment of key stakeholders in\n            coastal zone management. Had the institutional environment\n            been more thoroughly assessed, many of the delays and\n            implementation challenges encountered may have been\n            mitigated. A results framework with measurable targets and\n            well-defined baselines is critical to monitor project\n            progress. The lack of appropriate baseline data combined\n            with poorly designed performance indicators made it\n            difficult to effectively capture project achievements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - GEF-Ningbo Water and Environment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - GEF-Ningbo Water and\n            Environment
