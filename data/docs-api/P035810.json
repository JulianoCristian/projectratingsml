As years passed and as the economy\n            improved, the need for reform assistance became less urgent\n            and the government tended to become lukewarm towards the\n            more difficult parts of the reform program. Towards the end\n            of 2004, four years after approval of the credit, it\n            appeared as though the government was not keen to draw down\n            the third tranche. This experience would appear to indicate\n            that adjustment loans are best limited to one or two\n            tranches and a period not exceeding 12 to 18 months. The\n            reform program was ambitious in relation to the envisaged\n            time frame and the implementation capacity of the government\n            agencies. Shifting political landscapes added to the\n            problem. Another lesson is the obvious merit of back loading\n            the disbursement. It is fair to conclude that a reasonable\n            amount of reform was achieved for the amount of money that\n            was disbursed under the first two tranches. The toughest\n            conditions were attached to the third tranche, which also\n            had the largest share of the total credit. The operation\n            also seems to highlight the need for proper sequencing of\n            reform. In countries with a high degree of nonpayment and\n            non-cash payments, sector unbundling actually exacerbates\n            the problem and creates intra industry arrears starving the\n            upstream activities of any cash. A measure of control over\n            nonpayment problem has to be achieved through such steps as\n            effective legislation against theft of power, dismissal of\n            erring employees, disciplined disconnection of supplies to\n            non-payers, prohibition of non-cash settlement of any kind,\n            institution of effective and speedy bankruptcy procedures\n            against large defaulting consumers, restructuring of the\n            arrears and rescheduling of debts and writing off\n            irrecoverable arrears, before undertaking sector unbundling."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Consolidation Structural\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kyrgyz Republic - Consolidation\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6022102/kyrgyz-republic-consolidation-structural-adjustment-credit-project","projn":"KG-Consolidation Structural Adjustment\n            Credit (Csac) -- P035810","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Kyrgyz Republic","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050623105638"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Central government administration,Telecommunications,Other social services,General industry and trade sector,General energy sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Information and communications,Health and other social services,Industry and trade,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting, Accounting Standards, actual\n            costs, ADB, Adjustment Lending, auditors, authority, Bank\n            Performance, Boards of Directors, bureaucracy, Capacity\n            Building, cash collections, categorical assistance, Central\n            Asian, Central government, Central government\n            administration, competition policy, competitive bidding,\n            competitive bidding process, CONSOLIDATION, corruption,\n            cross subsidies, cross subsidization, Debt management, Debt\n            service, economies of scale, electricity, end use,\n            enforcement of regulations, environmental impacts, Exchange\n            Rate, exchange rates, exclusive rights, expenditure,\n            exports, financial crisis, financial performance, financial\n            viability, FISCAL, Fiscal deficit, fiscal deficits, FISCAL\n            YEAR, fuels, GDP, Government Decree, government departments,\n            government revenues, Gross Domestic Product, imports,\n            income, inefficiency, inflation, inflation rates,\n            institutional capacity, Institutional Development,\n            International Accounting Standards, labor costs, lack of\n            security, laws, legislative amendments, levies, licenses,\n            low tariffs, macroeconomic context, macroeconomic\n            management, Ministry of Finance, Monopolies, National\n            Communications, poor governance, Present Value, Private\n            Sector, private sector participation, privatization,\n            producers, profit margins, provisions, public debt, public\n            officials, real GDP, regulatory bodies, Republics,\n            residential consumers, resource mobilization, return on\n            investment, revenue administration, side payments, Social\n            Protection, Social protection system, social sectors, social\n            services, state agency, state budget, state owned\n            enterprises, State Property, state regulation, Structural\n            Adjustment, subsidiary, Tax, tax administration, tax\n            authorities, tax collections, tax compliance, Tax policy,\n            tax rate, tax rates, tax reform, Tax reforms, Tax revenues,\n            tax system, taxation, Telecommunications, transparency,\n            turnover taxes, utilities"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Structural Adjustment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024828-KYRGYZ - CONSOLIDATION\n            STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT (CSAC),TF024833-KYRGYZ REPUBLIC CONSOLIDATED\n            STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT,TF025588-PHRD-CONSOLIDATION STRUCTURAL\n            ADJ.

The project will: 1) implement tax\n            reforms, while improving revenue mobilization; 2) reduce\n            regulatory barriers at entry, and operation of businesses,\n            and enhance competitiveness; 3) improve the financial\n            condition of utilities, initiating a privatization process;\n            and, 4) strengthen the social protection system, partly to\n            compensate the poor for utility tariff increases. It is\n            expected that the project will consolidate fiscal\n            adjustment, and improve private sector growth, fostering\n            reforms in the energy sector, while minimizing its social\n            costs. However, risks exist, particularly on the political\n            front associated with the social aspects related to the\n            impact of tariff increases, which may dissipate due to\n            sociopolitical pressures. Investor interest in the\n            privatization process are further risks to consider, as well\n            as the ambitious reform program, which will require a strong\n            institutional capacity for its implementation. Nonetheless,\n            it is considered that the benefits of the operation, far\n            outnumber the potential risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Consolidation Structural\n
