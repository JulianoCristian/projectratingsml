program of structural adjustment.  Its\n            primary objectives will be to support the process of making\n            the agricultural credit system more market-oriented and of\n            reducing rural credit subsidies, and to bring about a reform\n            in trade and pricing policy for key agricultural\n            commodities.  To meet these objectives, the project will\n            support important changes in Government policies affecting\n            interest rates on official rural credit; trade and price\n            controls; risk management and financing for holders of\n            agricultural stocks; and market information systems.  The\n            loan will be disbursed in two tranches. All of the first\n            tranche and US$100 million of the second tranche will be\n            used to finance general imports.  Of the balance of US$100\n            million, US$75 million will be used to fund a new\n            dollar-denominated line of credit devoted to providing\n            much-needed finance for commodities held for the domestic\n            market. The other US$25 million will be made available to\n            finance equipment and technical assistance for the\n            development of new marketing instruments and a continued\n            program of agricultural policy studies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Credit and Marketing Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Credit and Marketing\n            Reform
