Increased efficiency of the financial sector would\n            be achieved through the development by the Central Bank of\n            Uruguay of norms to regulate and supervise medium and\n            long-term credit operations and through the project's\n            technical assistance that would address some of the\n            regulatory constraints to credit access in Uruguay.
