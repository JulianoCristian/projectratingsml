Institutional development impact is rated\n            substantial, and sustainability is rated likely. World Bank\n            and Borrower performances are rated satisfactory. This\n            project's experience suggests a number of lessons that\n            may be relevant in other countries: Building robust\n            institutions for a national response requires substantial\n            innovation and flexibility in implementation.\n            Epidemiological and behavioral surveillance provide key\n            information to build support for the response where denial\n            is high and the epidemic is otherwise \"invisible.\"\n            Projects that seek to enlist nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs)to implement HIV/AIDS interventions need to carefully\n            assess NGO capacity in light of what is expected, and to\n            ensure continuous training and technical support. When\n            political commitment is heterogeneous in a decentralized\n            system, channeling resources to effective programs in areas\n            with higher commitment can serve as a powerful demonstration\n            of the local feasibility of otherwise controversial\n            programs. Targeted awareness and interventions for high-risk\n            groups can be successful only to the extent that\n            complementary efforts are launched to improve the\n            environment for HIV prevention among these groups. Campaigns\n            to increase awareness of HIV/AIDS and promote changes in\n            attitudes and behavior should be informed by local research\n            in their design and implementation and in such a way as to\n            reduce the stigma of people living with HIV/AIDS. Where most\n            clients seek treatment for sexually transmitted diseases in\n            the private sector, engaging private and even traditional,\n            nonallopathic practitioners is necessary to ensure coverage\n            and impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - National AIDS Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - National AIDS Control

India's fight against HIV began\n            in earnest with the start of the World bank-financed\n            National AIDS Project, approved in 1992. To promote\n            nationwide efforts, the project set up AIDS control offices\n            in 32 states and union territories. It also helped establish\n            information, education, and communication (IEC) program,\n            exploiting media and traditional communications channels\n            such as folk music, festivals, awareness campaigns, and\n            elephant parades to highlight the risks of HIV or AIDS.\n            Building on initial phases of HIV or AIDS work, India now\n            faces the challenge of quickly and effectively implementing\n            programs in a number of states. Focusing on high-risk groups\n            and low-cost prevention efforts, the Second National AIDS\n            Control Project, approved by the World Bank in June 1999, is\n            helping India to carry on the fight against AIDS in India."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Stemming the AIDS epidemic"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Stemming the AIDS epidemic"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/07/23807059/india-stemming-aids-epidemic","count":"India","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"adult population, AIDS control, AIDS Control\n            Project, AIDS Epidemic, AIDS Project, awareness campaigns,\n            blood donations, blood safety, blood supply, condom, condom\n            distribution, high-risk, high-risk groups, HIV, HIV/AIDS,\n            National AIDS, National AIDS Control, prevalence, prevention\n            efforts, progress, Public knowledge, social marketing, Use\n            of condoms"}},"majtheme":"Social dev/gender/inclusion,Human development","topic":"Education and AIDS m1326130 1417,Health Education m1327026 1463,HIV and AIDS m1327522 1416,HIV/AIDS and Education m1326805 1542,Health Promotion and Disease Prevention\n            m1326336 1458","projn":"IN-Second National Hiv/Aids Control Project\n            -- P045051,IN-Aids Prevention And -- P010393","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"HIV AIDS,Adolescent Health,Gender and Health,Disease Control & Prevention,Population Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","entityids":{"entityid":"000442464_20150116152843"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Central government administration,Health","theme":"Population and reproductive health,Gender,Participation and civic engagement,Health system performance,HIV/AIDS","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Gender","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Education and AIDS m1326130 1417,Health Education m1327026 1463,HIV and AIDS m1327522 1416,HIV/AIDS and Education m1326805 1542,Health Promotion and Disease Prevention\n            m1326336 1458","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["C"],"trustfund":"TF021587-INDIA SECOND NATIONAL AIDS\n            CONTROL PROJECT,TF026215-FINANCING OF AUSAID SECONDMENTS,TF035426-INDIA - HEALTH PROJECTS,TF035579-INDIA - SECOND HIV, AIDS\n            CONTROL PROJECT,TF036099-INDIA - HIV, AIDS II PROJECT,TF036569-INDIA - SECOND NATIONAL AIDS\n            CONTROL PROJECT,TF036640-INDIA - PROPOSED SECOND\n            HIV/AIDS, MALARIA CONTROL PROJECT,TF037012-INDIA - SECOND NATIONAL AIDS\n            CONTROL PROJECT,TF037172-INDIA - AIDS PREVENTION PROJECT II,TFM21587-INDIA SECOND NATIONAL AIDS\n            CONTROL PROJECT,TFS21587-INDIA SECOND NATIONAL AIDS\n            CONTROL PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"91742"},"728766":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/03/728766/india-national-aids-control-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2000/03/728766/india-national-aids-control-project","new_url":"2000/03/728766/india-national-aids-control-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/04/24/000094946_00040805510483/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/04/24/000094946_00040805510483/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"2350","docdt":"2000-03-21T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2001-04-25T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"India - National AIDS Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Overall, the project is rated\n            satisfactory, and sustainability is high. The key lessons\n            address institutional, technical/social, and operational\n            issues as follows: 1) Institutionally, the central\n            government needs to play a leading role to initiate a\n            national response, in the face of a new public health\n            threat, namely HIV/AIDS, inadequately recognized by society,\n            particularly when institutional capacity is limited. It is\n            suggested that following the initial program implementation,\n            decentralization to states, and municipal corporations,\n            should take place, to ensure appropriate local responses to\n            epidemiological patterns, institutional capacities, and\n            commitment to the program. The government should establish\n            partnerships across sectors, with NGOs, and include the\n            participation of the private sector. 2) Technically and\n            socially, there is a need to create effective coverage to\n            plan program interventions, through public information,\n            enabling policy adjustments, and behavior changes. Improved\n            health methods should be ensured, through broader blood\n            banking systems, rather than the HIV testing alone, and,\n            epidemic differentials should be considered. Financial\n            management systems should be strengthened to maintain\n            epidemiological quality. 3) Operationally, the development\n            of a computerized financial management system would\n            alleviate financial, and accounting practices, and\n            forecasting systems could be included."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - National AIDS Control
