Although the current\n            market situation may not support the implementation of the\n            development project, these ilmenite reserves remain among\n            the most prospective for titanium production. It is,\n            therefore, likely that these engineering studies will have\n            to be pursued in some future date. As for this project, the\n            outcome is rated as unsatisfactory since it did not achieve\n            its major relevant objectives. The lessons learned from this\n            project primarily relate to the interaction between the Bank\n            and a private shareholder who is a partner with a\n            beneficiary of the International Development Association\n            (IDA) Credit. While every effort was made by the Bank to\n            inform Fer et Titane Inc.(QIT), the private partner and\n            project manager, of Bank procurement guidelines and\n            generally acceptable economic parameters for the project, it\n            took time for QIT to appreciate the realities of working\n            with the Bank. In summary, there is a very important role\n            for the Bank in stimulating private sector investment, but\n            it is critically important to realize that private sector\n            investors are far removed from Bank procedures. While Bank\n            staff went to great lengths to explain the requirements to\n            QIT, a cooperative partner, there was also much to learn\n            about private sector practices by both National Military\n            Office for Strategic Industries (OMNIS) and the Bank."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar -
