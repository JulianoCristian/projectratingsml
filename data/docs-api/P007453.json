The primary\n            objectives of the project were to: (i) strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of the Ministry to plan, manage and\n            maintain the road transport infrastructure in Jamaica in a\n            cost effective manner; (ii) improve the cost effectiveness\n            of the Borrower's investments in its road transport\n            sector and (iii) improve road safety. Bank performance\n            during the project cycle was generally unsatisfactory.\n            Borrower performance was weak overall during the course of\n            the project. Seven key lessons emerged from the project:( i)\n            project design must reflect the institutional capacity of\n            the implementing agency, mechanisms should be developed to\n            address implementation constraints, prior to committing\n            financing, and any institutional reform process should not\n            be dependent on individual personalities for its successful\n            implementation ; (i i) while a project must be flexible\n            enough  to respond to changing circumstances priorities and\n            the needs of the Borrower significant changes or the\n            addition of new activities must be weighed against the\n            associated risks, the demands on the Bank's technical\n            and supervisory resources plus its ability to supervise\n            additional components that fall outside the scope of the\n            original project; (iii) the Borrower's project staff\n            need to be held accountable for project performance, and\n            implementing agencies that cannot demonstrate adequate\n            management and reporting ability should not be permitted to\n            carry out extensive programs of works and procurement of\n            equipment through petty contracts;( iv) the complexity of\n            government procurement procedures was demonstrated in this\n            and other Bank financed projects and requires system-wide\n            rather than project-by-project solutions;( v) without\n            substantial         modification of the conditions of pay\n            and employment the sustainability of administrative and\n            institutional efforts is unlikely;( vi) specific project\n            outcome and impact measures, in addition to input and output\n            indicators, should be established during design, evaluated\n            as part of the project, and consistently monitored to\n            determine project achievement and impact;( vii) successful\n            project implementation requires commitment on the part of\n            Government and effective, continued and coordinated\n            supervision by the Bank with minimal changes in task management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Road Infrastructure Planning &\n            Maintenance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Road
