Project objectives were largely unachieved.\n            Notwithstanding some initial progress, actions slated to be\n            accomplished by end-1993 -- which embodied the heart of the\n            reform -- remained mostly incomplete at the end of June 1995\n            when the outstanding balance of the second tranche of the\n            credit was canceled. Of the three areas targeted, only the\n            private sector development component realized some success.\n            The largely unfinished agenda of SAC IH attests to its\n            unsatisfactory outcome. The PE sector was barely reduced;\n            most large PEs continue to perform poorly. Public\n            expenditure (PE) programming instruments are yet to be\n            internalized, integrated into the budget process, and\n            adhered to in practice. Sectoral PEP units have practically\n            ceased to function, while the management of budget\n            allocations still lacks transparency. No steps were taken\n            towards allocating expenditures for core developmental needs\n            or a social safety net; fiscal reform, in particular the\n            reduction of import tariffs and the revision of the general\n            tax code, barely advanced; and investment decisions continue\n            to ignore sound economic criteria. However, public resource\n            management did benefit from some reform measures, notably\n            the application of a unified budget and the recent adoption\n            of a new accounting system for the government. This\n            experience teaches, fundamentally, that an unstable\n            political environment damages the chances for successful\n            structural adjustment and demands, therefore, a degree of\n            healthy skepticism in the Bank's lending decision. The\n            prolonged and violent unfolding of Burundi's history --\n            and indeed that of its neighbor Rwanda -- shows all too\n            clearly the need for a cautious, realistic evaluation of\n            risk. Particularly where past performance has been\n            unimpressive, the scope of reform should be modest,\n            selective and reasonable in relation not only to resource\n            and other constraints but also to the duration of the\n            implementation period. Other lessons emphasize the\n            importance of thorough internalization, prior to credit\n            effectiveness and involving up-front participation over a\n            broad spectrum of all those engaged in and affected by the program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Third Structural Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Third Structural\n

- Third Structural Adjustment Program"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main objectives of the Third\n            Structural Adjustment Credit Project are to help strengthen\n            the economy's supply response to the adjustment process\n            by further reducing the role of the state in the economy\n            and, in conjunction with an IMF supported ESAF (Enhanced\n            Structural Adjustment Facility) arrangement, by continuing\n            to alleviate policy constraints to private sector\n            development. This operation will also shield vulnerable\n            groups from the transitional costs of adjustment. The\n            operation will support reforms in three key areas: i) a\n            reduced and more effective role for the state; ii)\n            elimination of policy and legal/regulatory constraints to\n            private sector development; and iii) improved access to\n            social services, especially for lower income groups. The\n            redefined state role will focus on reducing the fiscal\n            deficit by accelerating the restructuring of the public\n            enterprise sector and reducing non-developmental\n            expenditure. Private sector development and export\n            diversification will be promoted through liberalization of\n            external transactions, the agricultural sector and factor\n            markets, and reform of the regulatory, legal and fiscal\n            systems. Finally, a social sector component will promote a\n            more appropriate pattern of public expenditure through the\n            maintenance of a safety net of social expenditure and\n            measures to improve the quality of basic health and\n            education services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Third Structural Adjustment Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Third Structural\n            Adjustment Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/05/735462/burundi-third-structural-adjustment-program","projn":"BI-Sal III -- P000208","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Economic Theory & Research,Public Sector Economics,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Burundi","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961002234622"},"subsc":"Health,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade,General industry and trade sector,Other domestic and international trade,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,Agriculture,arable\n            land,audits,balance of payments,Bank\n            lending,borrowing,budget deficits,civil\n            service,competitiveness,Conditionality,crowding\n            out,debt,debt service,deposits,dividends,EconomIc\n            Development,economic growth,economic\n            reform,education,employment,Exchange\n            Rate,exploitation,exports,Family Planning,financial\n            sector,fisheries,foreign exchange,forestry,GDP,growth\n            rate,health,imports,income,income groups,inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,investment\n            banking,Legal Framework,living conditions,macroeconomic\n            policies,marginal costs,Market\n            Liberalization,marketing,media,migration,monetary\n            policies,monopolies,per capita income,pollution,population\n            growth,Population pressures,Private Sector,private sector\n            participation,productive assets,productivity,public\n            enterprises,Public Expenditure,Public Expenditure\n            Review,Public Expenditures,Public Investment,public\n            Investments,public revenues,public savings,public\n            sector,real GDP,Safety,savings,savings deposits,social\n            services,soil degradation,Structural Adjustment,Tax,Tax\n            Reform,technical assistance,telecommunications,terms of\n            trade,transport,treasury,unemployment,urban\n            development,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural production,Agriculture,arable\n            land,audits,balance of payments,Bank\n            lending,borrowing,budget deficits,civil\n            service,competitiveness,Conditionality,crowding\n            out,debt,debt service,deposits,dividends,EconomIc\n            Development,economic growth,economic\n            reform,education,employment,Exchange\n            Rate,exploitation,exports,Family Planning,financial\n            sector,fisheries,foreign exchange,forestry,GDP,growth\n            rate,health,imports,income,income groups,inflation,inflation\n            rate,insurance,interest rate,interest rates,investment\n            banking,Legal Framework,living conditions,macroeconomic\n            policies,marginal costs,Market\n            Liberalization,marketing,media,migration,monetary\n            policies,monopolies,per capita income,pollution,population\n            growth,Population pressures,Private Sector,private sector\n            participation,productive assets,productivity,public\n            enterprises,Public Expenditure,Public Expenditure\n            Review,Public Expenditures,Public Investment,public\n            Investments,public revenues,public savings,public\n            sector,real GDP,Safety,savings,savings deposits,social\n            services,soil degradation,Structural Adjustment,Tax,Tax\n            Reform,technical assistance,telecommunications,terms of\n            trade,transport,treasury,unemployment,urban\n            development,water supply"}},"owner":"Management, Service Center (HRSSC)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF023695-SPA II FOR BURUNDI'S PH.3\n            STRUCTURAL ADJ","repnb":"P5806"},"facets":{}}}
