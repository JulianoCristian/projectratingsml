It is highlighted that\n            while in principle, the project design, neglected short-term\n            upgrade of urban areas in favor of the preparation of a\n            long-term infrastructure investment plan, it proved a sound\n            and valid approach. However, the project revealed the limits\n            of the community-based approach to addressing broader urban\n            development, and management issues. Future operations should\n            consider the following lessons to make project impacts more\n            sustainable and replicable. For the project to scale up its\n            impact, a participatory investment program should have been\n            combined with a comprehensive support, and capacity building\n            program for municipalities. In the future, operations should\n            rather expand from narrowly defined community-based\n            infrastructure development, to broader municipal operations.\n            Particular attention should be given to strengthening urban\n            regulatory functions, e.g., preparation of urban plans and\n            definition of building permit procedures, all of which aim\n            to promote, guide, regulate, and support private sector\n            development. Noticeably, any follow-up project should have a\n            substantially larger component for upgrading primary\n            infrastructure. Project experience made it clear that land\n            tenure issues in peri-urban areas are complex, and involve\n            serious social and political implications, and, it is not\n            within the jurisdiction of the municipalities. Therefore,\n            there may be a need for a separate project, specifically\n            focusing on land tenure, and land registration aspects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Urban Land Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Urban Land Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/04/6021989/albania-urban-land-development-project","projn":"AL-Land Development Project -- P040975","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Albania","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050623101730"},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"General public administration sector,Roads and highways,Power,Other social services,General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Energy and mining,Health and other social services,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Bank Performance, basic services, Capacity\n            Building, communities, Community Based Organizations,\n            comprehensive urban upgrading, decentralization,\n            decentralization process, economic analysis, electricity,\n            FISCAL YEAR, government intervention, housing, information\n            dissemination, infrastructure services, Institutional\n            Development, inventory, LAND DEVELOPMENT, Land prices, land\n            tenure, land value, laws, legal framework, local government,\n            local governments, migration, municipal investments,\n            municipalities, operating costs, Pollution, Private Housing,\n            private sector, productivity, public housing, Public Works,\n            Risk Factors, Roads, sanitation, schools, secondary cities,\n            security of land tenure, sewage, social services, solid\n            waste collection, subdivisions, tax, Technical Assistance,\n            transport, urban areas, urban communities, urban\n            development, urban housing, urban infrastructure, urban land\n            management, urban management, urban planning, urban\n            population, urban sector, urban services, urban upgrading,\n            urbanization, waste, waste collection, water supply"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF026593-JSDF-ALBANIA: STRENGTHENING\n            URBAN COMMUNITIES IN INFORMAL SETTLEMENT,TF029311-PHRD - HOUSING II - LAND DEVELOPMENT,TF029405-PHRD-TIRANA LOCALIZED SEWAGE\n            FACILITIES PROJECT,TF032397-ALBANIA - HOUSING II,TF032910-ALBANIA - URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING,TF033574-ALBANIA - HOUSING,TF034868-ECA REGION (ALBANIA-LAND\n            DEVELOPMENT AND POLAND-WROCLAW SOLID,TF037033-ALBANIA - URBAN LAND MANAGEMENT PROJECT,TF039060-TURKMENISTAN - SOCIAL\n            ASSESSMENT - AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT,TF039852-ALBANIA - RURAL DEVELOPMENT","repnb":"32394"},"693607":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/04/693607/albania-urban-land-management-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/04/693607/albania-urban-land-management-project","new_url":"1998/04/693607/albania-urban-land-management-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1998/04/21/000009265_3980624164556/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1998/04/21/000009265_3980624164556/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"3066","docdt":"1998-04-21T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1998-04-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Albania - Urban Land Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The primary objective of the Urban Land\n            Management Project is to provide essential urban\n            infrastructure to unserviced or neglected areas in\n            participating municipalities, including the Municipality of\n            Tirana and the District of Tirana (Greater Tirana) and\n            strengthen the institutions responsible for the delivery of\n            urban services at the national and local levels.
