This project is a pilot for\n            broader judicial reform efforts. The long-term objective is\n            to establish a legal and institutional framework which can\n            effectively protect private property, enforce contracts,\n            defend economic rights against infringement, establish a\n            secure environment for private investment and efficient exit\n            mechanisms for business. the project has five main\n            components. The first supports the design of an effective,\n            replicable court and case management model and its\n            implementation in six pilot courts. The second component\n            helps create and access an automated and networked legal\n            information system in the pilot courts. The third component\n            build capacity in the Ministry of Justice to license\n            trustees and administrators; provides incentives for\n            creating an independent regulatory body for trustees and\n            administrators under the umbrella of the Chamber of\n            Commerce; and assists in preparing rules and proceudres,\n            performance monitoring, and education and training. The\n            fourth component upgrades the skills of bankruptcy\n            professionals while the fifth component finances studies to\n            understand the legal and institutional
