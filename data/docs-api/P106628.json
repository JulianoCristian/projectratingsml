Creating and maintaining interoperability - the\n            ability of information systems to have harmonized concepts\n            and data, and automatically exchange information - is a\n            process that requires continual reassessment, evolution, and\n            a phased approach.

When designing a\n            component or sub-component that is highly concentrated in\n            information technology (IT) investment, it is important to\n            either engage in a deep analysis of the desired\n            functionalities during the preparation phase in order to\n            ensure a clear understanding of the scope of the system, or\n            to build in some flexibility in the allocation of project\n            funds in the event of greater than expected costs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
