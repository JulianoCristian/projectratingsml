Some lessons\n            learned included: The original project design envisaged that\n            Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) will\n            finance major greenfield investment projects with majority\n            private sector ownership. Other forms of private sector\n            projects such as joint ventures were not envisaged. If other\n            kinds of public-private sector arrangements and more types\n            of infrastructure had been eligible, IDCOL could have built\n            a more diversified portfolio of investments that could have\n            catalyzed the project. Bank assessments of other projects\n            like PSIDP involving financial intermediaries similar to\n            IDCOL that are agencies of government but at the same time\n            independent of government have concluded that such\n            structures are inherently flawed due to governance and\n            control issues stemming from acting as a fiduciary without a\n            clear mandate and clear delegation of responsibility.\n            However this does not appear to have been the case in the\n            PSIDP project as IDCOL did in fact demonstrate its\n            competency when it financed the Meghnaghat sub-project under\n            PSIDP and in subsequent project financings without PSDIP\n            support. In addition as the experience of financial\n            intermediaries such as the Infrastructure Leasing and\n            Financial Services company and IREDA in India will suggest,\n            it is not impossible in principle to establish such public\n            sector agencies with a high degree of professional\n            competence that are able to act entrepreneurially with\n            operational independence at arms length from government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Private Sector Infrastructure\n            Development

This project has two components: project\n            financing and sub-project transaction development. The\n            financing component supports sub-projects in mobilizing\n            adequate debt financing if they meet funding eligibility\n            criteria, where the sub-project sponsors have reached the\n            limit of mobilizing market-based financing. It is expected\n            that the sub-projects will be structured as\n            build-operate-own (BOO) or build-operate-transfer (BOT)\n            projects (or variations thereof), and financed on a limited\n            recourse basis. Transaction development is a government-led\n            function involving initiatives by project agencies, line\n            ministries, and other parastatals. Technical assistance will\n            be available to Bangladesh agencies and line ministries to\n            promote private sector participation, both at a policy level\n            and to promote specific transactions.  Assistance is also\n            required by line managers and ministries prior to\n            transactions, to establish proper framework and policies,\n            identify viable sub-projects, and carry out feasibility\n            studies. During transactions, assistance is required to\n            conduct competitive and transparent procurement processes,\n            market sub-projects to encourage good competition among\n            quality sponsors, and manage the entire process of\n            structuring, documentation, bidding, negotiations, and\n            concession awards. After award, a core advisory services\n            unit will be set up to continuously assist the private\n            sector developer and the public sector counterpart agency\n            with the project's timely construction, operation, and regulation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
