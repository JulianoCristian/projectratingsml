Some lessons\n            learned included: International Competitive Bidding (ICB) is\n            the best means to ensure low prices. Contract costs awarded\n            through ICB have been lower than their estimated costs,\n            while costs of contracts awarded through direct negotiations\n            under Co-financing have been significantly higher than their\n            estimated costs. The practice of conducting long and\n            protracted negotiations with the winning bidder to drive\n            down quoted prices, or increase the local content, may\n            appear to be an accomplishment in the short-term. However,\n            it may not be in the best interests of PLN (Engineering\n            Services Center) as the contractor could run short of\n            resources to sustain its operations and deliver in\n            accordance with the agreed schedule, as is clearly borne out\n            by the experience gained on this project. Bank policy\n            dialogue should be linked to individual projects. In this\n            case, while the Bank raised the problem of excess capacity\n            as early as 1994, a stronger case could have been made if\n            the implication of this excess capacity for Bank financed\n            plants such as Paiton had been highlighted at an earlier stage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

and (iv) technical assistance to strengthen the\n            capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy to formulate\n            and enforce environmental standards in the energy sector,\n            and to train PLN's engineering and design staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Paiton Thermal Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Paiton Thermal Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/05/738562/indonesia-paiton-thermal-power-project","projn":"ID-Paiton Thermal -- P003875","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Demand,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Economic Theory & Research,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960927175626"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,aLternative fuels,barrels of\n            oil,barrels per day,budget constraints,Coal,Coal Mining,coal\n            prices,coal production,coal reserves,cogeneration,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,Construction,Consumers,decentralization,demand\n            for electricity,Demand Growth,diesel,distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,domestic energy,economic\n            activity,Economic Rate of Return,economies of scale,Electric\n            Power,electrical energy,Electricity,Electricity\n            consumption,electricity generation,electricity\n            prices,electricity sales,electricity supply,energy\n            consumption,energy policy,Energy Prices,Energy\n            Resources,engineering,Engineering Services,Environmental\n            Aspects,Environmental Impact,environmental\n            standards,expenditures,exploitation,export\n            markets,exports,Forecasts,forestry,fuel,fuel,fuel\n            oil,Gas,Gas Company,gas reserves,GDP,generation\n            capacity,geothermal\n            energy,heat,income,inefficiency,Insurance,interest\n            rate,Marginal Cost,Mines,Natural Gas,natural gas\n            reserves,Oil,Oil Consumption,oil\n            equivalent,OPEC,organizational structure,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            Products,power generation,power plants,pressure,Primary\n            Energy,producers,Proven reserves,Public\n            Works,quotas,recoverable reserves,residual fuel,residual\n            fuel oil,rural electrification,Technical Assistance,Thermal Power,waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"Agriculture,aLternative fuels,barrels of\n            oil,barrels per day,budget constraints,Coal,Coal Mining,coal\n            prices,coal production,coal reserves,cogeneration,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy\n            consumption,Construction,Consumers,decentralization,demand\n            for electricity,Demand Growth,diesel,distribution\n            losses,distribution of electricity,domestic energy,economic\n            activity,Economic Rate of Return,economies of scale,Electric\n            Power,electrical energy,Electricity,Electricity\n            consumption,electricity generation,electricity\n            prices,electricity sales,electricity supply,energy\n            consumption,energy policy,Energy Prices,Energy\n            Resources,engineering,Engineering Services,Environmental\n            Aspects,Environmental Impact,environmental\n            standards,expenditures,exploitation,export\n            markets,exports,Forecasts,forestry,fuel,fuel,fuel\n            oil,Gas,Gas Company,gas reserves,GDP,generation\n            capacity,geothermal\n            energy,heat,income,inefficiency,Insurance,interest\n            rate,Marginal Cost,Mines,Natural Gas,natural gas\n            reserves,Oil,Oil Consumption,oil\n            equivalent,OPEC,organizational structure,Petroleum,Petroleum\n            Products,power generation,power plants,pressure,Primary\n            Energy,producers,Proven reserves,Public\n            Works,quotas,recoverable reserves,residual fuel,residual\n            fuel oil,rural electrification,Technical Assistance,Thermal Power,waste"}},"owner":"Indonesia Headquarters Unit (EACIQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"7718"},"facets":{}}}
