The purpose of the project was to increase\n            agricultural productivity and farm incomes through a more\n            reliable, predictable and equitable irrigation service.\n            Bank\u2019s performance was highly satisfactory in identification\n            of the project, satisfactory in preparation assistance and\n            appraisal and deficient in supervision. Borrower\u2019s\n            performance was deficient in preparation and implementation\n            and operation. The main lessons learned from this project\n            were as follows: a) extensive equitable irrigation and\n            self-financing irrigation schemes are two objectives which\n            may not be necessarily compatible; b) projects of this type\n            which involve not only technical changes to the status quo,\n            but also have significant social aspects, require a high\n            level of farmer participation in irrigation management (PIM)\n            to be successful; c) a baseline survey of the condition of\n            the system infrastructure and cropping practices is a\n            prerequisite to prepare a detailed scheme report for\n            rehabilitation and modernization; d) high quality technical\n            assistance and third party supervision should be considered\n            in future project; and e) Operation and Maintenance\n            (O&M) of the scheme should be jointly carried out by\n            department officers and farmer beneficiaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - National Water Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - National Water Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/01/732024/india-national-water-management-project","topic":"Irrigation Water Quality m1325973 1002,Irrigation Methods m1327355 992,Groundwater Management m1327704 156","projn":"IN-Nat.
