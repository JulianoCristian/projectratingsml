Several lessons\n            drawn form the project suggest the following. Given the\n            complexity of this type of umbrella project, it is strongly\n            recommended that in the future, such projects utilize the\n            new Bank lending mechanisms, such as the Adaptable Program\n            Loan, namely utilizing a phased programmatic lending\n            process, i.e., first, funding comprehensive feasibility\n            analysis, and project design; secondly, funding project\n            construction; and, third, funding agricultural development,\n            and technical assistance (TA). However, project-finance\n            planning should carefully evaluate the Government's\n            ability to meet counterpart funding requirements, and,\n            macroeconomic factors must be taken into consideration\n            during preparation. Moreover, the strong tendency among all\n            borrowers to emphasize the construction of infrastructure,\n            and to divert project funding from later phases, such as TA,\n            and agricultural development to meet overruns in the cost of\n            infrastructure, could and should be avoided by the\n            programmatic lending instrument, which separates the project\n            phases, avoiding intermingling funds. Further lessons\n            include the importance of clear, and reliable project\n            design; of realistic supervision cost estimates, as well as\n            time schedules to avoid implementation delays; of effective\n            monitoring criteria, and identified performance indicators;\n            and, of institutional strengthening of the implementing agencies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
