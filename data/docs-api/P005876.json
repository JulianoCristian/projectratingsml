The key\n            lessons learned were as follows: (i)co-financing and\n            parallel financing is not always suitable, and participate\n            in causing delay in implementation; (ii) project\n            Implementation Unit has to be provided with necessary\n            possibilities, support, and enough space of authority to be\n            effective, and can improve its performance to meet the\n            requirements of financiers; (iii) further training in water\n            sector management is needed for field technical employees,\n            rather than the office management who considers the training\n            as touring visit; and, (iv) further improving operational\n            and administrative efficiency is required for the Branch\n            particularly in the following aspects:(a) the reduction of\n            unaccounted-for water;(b) introducing computerization system\n            for the main departments;(c) restructuring of the
