Lessons cited included:\n            1) Financial Intermediation Operations are good vehicles to\n            help smaller banks engage in international finance. 2) A\n            credit line operation dramatically improves understanding of\n            the prevailing conditions in the banking markets and of the\n            financial condition of major banking institutions. This\n            understanding can better focus the policy dialogue or\n            improve the design of adjustment operations.3) The\n            Bank's ability to assist with the critical elements of\n            the macroeconomic framework and reforms programs, and get\n            directly involved with individual banks and their clients\n            seemed to be an important factor in the Project's\n            success. 4) Project design should be simple and make\n            accessing funds easier. 5) Benefits to banks in\n            participating in a Bank credit line operation extend beyond\n            access to Bank funding. 6) Demonstration and spill-over\n            effects can be as important in developing the local economy.\n            7) The objectives, expectations, and performance indicators\n            of technical assistance in a credit line operation should be\n            realistic.8)  Building technical and managerial capacity in\n            the project implementation unit is critical. 9) Staffing\n            continuity facilitates project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -

The project comprises\n            two main components: 1) provision of a credit line to\n            support private enterprise finance, extended through\n            participating private banks. The eligibility criteria for\n            businesses, stipulates the average percentage of private\n            equity required, active manufacturing capacity, and a\n            required maintenance of debt-to-equity ratio, and debt\n            service coverage ratio. The eligibility criteria of\n            subprojects is determined by the readiness to finance at\n            least twenty five percent of the subproject's cost,\n            based on a business plan, balance sheet, income statement,\n            and cash-flow projections. A subsidiary finance to\n            participating financial intermediaries (PFIs) will be\n            extended, based on specific sub-loan conditionality\n            (investment loans, working capital, interest rate, extension\n            terms and service charges) denominated in Euro currency,\n            where borrowing enterprises will assume currency risks,\n            interest rate, and currency risks will be limited, while\n            credit risk will be assumed by the PFIs, and, 2) technical\n            assistance will be extended, also in euro currency,\n
