Bank performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory because a firmer line should have been taken\n            on administrative restructuring. Borrower performance is\n            rated unsatisfactory because of substantial delays during\n            implementation. OED rates the outcome of the Agricultural\n            Sector Investment Project as moderately satisfactory and\n            sustainability is likely. Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory, reflecting the solid analytic underpinnings of\n            the project and the generally adequate nature of\n            supervision. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory,\n            primarily because of the high commitment to the project. OED\n            rates the outcome of the Northwest Mountainous Area\n            Development Project as satisfactory and sustainability is\n            rated likely because the participatory approach has built\n            community ownership. The National Rural Finance\n            Project's outcome is rated highly unsatisfactory\n            because it failed to improve on the deficient approach and\n            mixed performance of the projects that preceded it.\n            Sustainability is rated unlikely based primarily on the weak\n            loan recovery rate. Bank performance is rated highly\n            unsatisfactory because of the design deficiencies (reflected\n            in hurried preparation). Borrower performance is also rated\n            highly unsatisfactory, reflecting on the government's\n            failure to allow the National Agriculture Bank to function\n            as a solvent commercial enterprise. Four important lessons\n            were confirmed by this project experience: First, a\n            piecemeal approach to reform-trying to effect small changes\n            under the cover of a number of investment operations-offers\n            little leverage and is therefore unlikely to work. Second,\n            attempts to strengthen monitoring are futile if the\n            performance indicators monitored are not linked to achieving\n            significant outcomes. Third, decentralization is an\n            important objective, but may be counterproductive if\n            resources are spread too thinly. This is a particularly\n            important issue for agricultural services, the structure of\n            which needs to be rationalized. Fourth, where there have\n            been several interventions which are cumulative in effect it\n            is reasonable for evaluators to have higher expectations of\n            development effectiveness and to be correspondingly more\n            demanding in their search for evidence of effectiveness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Agricultural Research and\n            Extension

Sustainable management\n            of natural resources and the environment in the northwest\n            region and in Tunisia generally will remain important goals\n            in the near future and the long term. The successful\n            implementation of this project has provided many important\n            lessons which can contribute to the attainment of this goal.\n            The key lessons include: To attain maximum impact, project\n            funded research should be limited to topics which are an\n            integral part of project activities, demand-driven, and\n            consistent with the development objectives. Dissemination\n            techniques that include local farmers can be successful if\n            they are given adequate technical assistance. When dealing\n            with small-scale farmers, techniques that take into account\n            the entire production system are more likely to be adopted\n            than those developed for a specific crop or ecosystem. When\n            a project includes land consolidation it is important to\n            provide incentive such as land titling. Participation of all\n            stakeholders ensures the success of the participatory\n            approach from the early stages of project preparation. The\n            participatory approach requires flexible project budgeting.\n            Women extension agents are necessary to ensure women's\n            participation in

         It will help restore sustainable range, forest and farming\n            activities, reducing soil degradation, erosion and\n            sedimentation in reservoirs as well as increasing\n            productivity and incomes in this impoverished region of\n            Tunisia.  By using a participatory approach, it will\n            strengthen farmers' planning and implementation\n            capacity, and improve the responsiveness of rural service\n            agencies to farmers' needs.  The project will support\n            development of a participatory approach to watershed\n            rehabilitation in about 50 micro-catchments in the\n            Governorates of Beja, El Kef, Siliana, Jendouba and Bizerte\n            over a six-year period.  Treatments will be integrated\n            across a micro-catchment, and selected and implemented with\n            the participation of the local population.  Treatments will\n            include improved range management, improved fodder\n            production, soil and conservation works.  The project will\n            also provide such basic infrastructure as feeder roads,\n            potable water, health centers and schools.  The projects\n            will strengthen the planning, coordination, and\n            implementation capacity of the executing agency and village\n            groups. The project will provide for demand-driven,\n            short-term applied research to address key development\n            constraints in the region.  The micro-enterprise development\n            component will promote, on a pilot scheme basis, the\n            development of the informal sector and the establishment of\n            village credit associations. The Geographic Information\n            Service (GIS) will support surveys and inventories,\n            selection and management of conservation areas and\n            monitoring and evaluation. The project will finance land\n            surveys needed for land titling."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Northwest Mountainous Areas\n            Development
