Some lessons\n            learned included: the project underestimated the Technical\n            Assistance (TA) needs in AzerPost and did not initially\n            suggest an efficient solution in the project design. During\n            the implementation, the project developed a holistic,\n            multi-pillar approach to improve access to finance and\n            payment services. It established a legal and governance\n            framework for AzerPost to increase access to finance. Until\n            early 2006, AzerPost lacked a dedicated director responsible\n            for the project implementation, contributing to slow project\n            launch. Due to his background, the new Deputy Director\n            responsible for the project played a key role in advancing\n            project implementation, raising and getting issues resolved\n            with the key stakeholders throughout the project life. The\n            World Bank lacked sufficient Information Technology (IT)\n            procurement resources in the country office (there were two\n            IT procurement experts for the entire Europe and Central\n            Asia Region). This increased overall supervision costs and\n            slowed down procurement process for key IT procurement\n            packages significantly, respectively. Therefore, it is\n            important to provide the staff and financial resources\n            according to the complexity of the projects so that the lack\n            thereof would not cause delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Financial Services Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Azerbaijan - Financial Services\n            Development
