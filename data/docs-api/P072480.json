Some lessons learned\n            included: long-term financing to renewable energy\n            development can be financially viable. However, financing\n            renewable energy is a complex line of business and capacity\n            building support should be provided to financial\n            institutions in strengthening project evaluation and\n            engineering skills and environmental and social safeguard\n            functions. For renewable energy projects, technical\n            assistance to financial institutions should be considered\n            being incorporated into initial project designs. Success of\n            the project can be linked to the long-term programmatic\n            approach that Turkey has adopted and the Bank has supported\n            to create the enabling environment, build capacity and\n            catalyze investments. The Turkish experience suggests that\n            the development of renewable energy often faces an array of\n            barriers, including institutional, capacity and financing\n            challenges. To promote the utilization of renewable\n            resources requires a thorough understanding of the sector\n            background, long-term efforts, and a strategic mix of policy\n            and investment interventions to overcome these barriers. A\n            predicable policy and regulatory environment is a critical\n            precondition for private sector investment in renewable\n            energy development. Having a supportive policy environment,\n            including predictable feed-in tariffs and transparent rules\n            for electricity trading are critical for attracting private\n            sector investment. Other favorable policies include\n            facilitation of developer access to land and adoption of\n            transparent and streamlined procures for obtaining licenses\n            and water-use rights in the case of hydropower development.\n            For renewable energy projects, it is important to develop a\n            coherent strategy that integrates the establishment of an\n            enabling policy and regulatory environment within the\n            overall framework of the project design. High levels of\n            sponsor collateral requirement constrained small renewable\n            developers with low collateral value from accessing finance.\n            It is important to develop more friendly policies for small,\n            first-time renewable developers in the future, such as\n            guarantee fund, to overcome the challenge."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

Renewable Energy Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project objective is to increase\n            privately owned and operated distributed power generation\n            from renewable sources, without the need for government\n            guarantees, and within the market-based framework of the new\n            Turkish Electricity Market Law. The project has the\n            following two components: Component 1) The SPDF is a term\n            lending facility which will be established and will be\n            operated by the two financial intermediaries (Fls). The two\n            Fls selected are: (a) Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB)\n            - the Turkish Industrial Development Bank (private); (b)\n            Turkiye Kalkinma Bankasi (TKB) - the Turkish Development\n            Bank (Government) The World Bank loan for the SPDF will be\n            on-lent from Treasury (the Borrower) to the Fls. The Fls\n            will utilize the SPDF to provide long-term debt financing to\n            private sponsors of renewable energy projects. The SPDF is\n            intended to leverage equity investment from local private\n            developers, export credit financing and other financing for\n            the construction and operation of qualified renewable\n            generation projects. Component 2) In order to support the\n            implementation of the Project, Ministry of Energy and\n            Natural Resources (MENR), General Directorate of State\n            Hydraulic Works (DSI) and General Directorate of Electrdic\n            Power Resources (EIE) will undertake various institutional\n            development activities. These activities will be financed\n            through internal sources and grants. The World Bank and the\n            Government will work together to obtain the required grant\n            financing for these activities. The principal institutional\n            development activities that will be pursued include: (a)\n            Renewable Energy Development Capacity: For the immediate to\n            medium-term (next 2-3 years) there is a substantial\n            potential pipeline of projects which are at an advanced\n            stage of development by private sponsors. (b) Legislation\n            for Renewable Energy Resource Development: Apart from the\n            Electricity Market Law ( EML) and the MENR-DSI Regulation on\n            Principles and Procedures for Obtaining a Water-Use Rights\n            Agreement, Turkey does not have a specific and comprehensive\n            law for renewable energy resource development. (c)\n            Mechanisms for Public-Private Hydropower Development: With\n            the implementation of the new Electricity Market Law (Law\n            No. 4628), the responsibilities for developing new\n            hydropower generation will tend to shift towards the private sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
