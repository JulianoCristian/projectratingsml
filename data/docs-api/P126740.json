Most of the population continues to be\n            dispersed across rural areas of the archipelago, where they\n            largely depend on subsistence agriculture. This caps food\n            poverty rates, but exposes the population to environmental\n            shocks. Poverty rates are higher in urban areas, where\n            traditional safety nets are weaker and unemployment rates\n            are high. A former British protectorate, the country became\n            independent in 1978 and enjoyed twenty years of moderate but\n            sustained economic growth and improvement in social\n            indicators.
