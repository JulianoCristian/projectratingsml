The Project's objective was to support the\n            Government of Bangladesh's (GOB) financial sector\n            reform program and assist in financial restructuring of the\n            nationalized commercial banks (NCBs). A host of factors,\n            both subject to and not subject to government control,\n            affected the achievement of project objectives. For\n            instance, the GOB could not control the delay in securing a\n            bank supervision expert, which adversely affected the\n            ability of Bangladesh Bank (BB) to strengthen. However, the\n            unwillingness of GOB and BB to reduce the deposit rate floor\n            in line with falling inflation and to tighten or even\n            enforce the existing lax loan classification and\n            provisioning requirements affected the interest rate reform\n            objectives. The NCB strengthening was adversely affected by\n            GOB's failure to implement the politically difficult\n            but necessary NCB management reforms including their\n            compensation. The improvement in the debt recovery\n            environment was affected by the delay in amending the\n            Financial Loan Courts Act, 1990, to close the identified\n            loopholes and expand the courts' jurisdiction. Finally,\n            the initiation of the TA Project was delayed partly due to\n            procedural delays in getting GOB clearances of individual consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
