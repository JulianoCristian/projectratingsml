The technical\n            assistance will aid DROA with the MTPCH training school in\n            Cotonou and the Equipment Maintenance Division; and (e)\n            prepare for a future project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Third Feeder Roads Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Third Feeder Roads Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/04/725104/benin-third-feeder-roads-project","projn":"BJ-Feeder Roads III -- P000085","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Regional Rural Development,Banks & Banking Reform,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901074045"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accessibility,accounting,Agricultural\n            activities,Agriculture,airlines,Auditing,bridge,bridge\n            construction,Bridges,broken\n            lines,cargo,Cement,Construction,construction\n            methods,corridor,crops,culverts,deposits,Domestic civil\n            aviation,drainage,earth roads,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equalization,excavation,export,Feeder\n            Roads,finances,FISCAL YEAR,footpaths,freight,fuel,Government\n            intervention,gravel,gravel roads,heavy\n            equipment,Highway,highway\n            projects,Highways,Housing,inflation,institutional\n            development,international airport,international\n            Port,journey,journey time,laterite,main\n            roads,migration,north-south corridor,operating\n            costs,passenger,paved roads,Periodic\n            Maintenance,productivity,prospecting,Public\n            Investments,public transport,Public Works,quarry\n            operations,range,Rate of Return,Reference,remote,Road\n            Construction,road density,Road Financing,road\n            improvement,Road Maintenance,road network,road planning,road\n            safety,Road Transport,road user charges,road\n            users,route,Routes,rural areas,Rural Development,rural\n            population,Rural Road\n            Construction,rust,Soils,speed,square,strength,supervision,Taxation,technical\n            assistance,terrain,tires,traffic,trails,Transport,transport infrastructure,Transportation,trips,trucks,Upper,vehicles,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accessibility,accounting,Agricultural\n            activities,Agriculture,airlines,Auditing,bridge,bridge\n            construction,Bridges,broken\n            lines,cargo,Cement,Construction,construction\n            methods,corridor,crops,culverts,deposits,Domestic civil\n            aviation,drainage,earth roads,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,equalization,excavation,export,Feeder\n            Roads,finances,FISCAL YEAR,footpaths,freight,fuel,Government\n            intervention,gravel,gravel roads,heavy\n            equipment,Highway,highway\n            projects,Highways,Housing,inflation,institutional\n            development,international airport,international\n            Port,journey,journey time,laterite,main\n            roads,migration,north-south corridor,operating\n            costs,passenger,paved roads,Periodic\n            Maintenance,productivity,prospecting,Public\n            Investments,public transport,Public Works,quarry\n            operations,range,Rate of Return,Reference,remote,Road\n            Construction,road density,Road Financing,road\n            improvement,Road Maintenance,road network,road planning,road\n            safety,Road Transport,road user charges,road\n            users,route,Routes,rural areas,Rural Development,rural\n            population,Rural Road\n            Construction,rust,Soils,speed,square,strength,supervision,Taxation,technical\n            assistance,terrain,tires,traffic,trails,Transport,transport infrastructure,Transportation,trips,trucks,Upper,vehicles,wages"}},"owner":"CD13: BN/NE/TG (AFC13)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"4901"},"facets":{}}}
