  achieve sustainable tourism development based on the\n            cultural and natural patrimony of the Copan Valley and the\n            surrounding areas which will, as a result, create investment\n            opportunities for the private sector, foster employment, and\n            reduce poverty in one of the poorest regions of Honduras. To\n            increase economic growth, the Government is pursuing a\n            robust tourism development strategy that capitalizes on its\n            many exceptional natural and cultural resources. In 2002,\n            tourism grew by 20 percent with more than 800,000 visitors.\n            The Government seeks to increase this number to one million\n            visitors by 2005 and be a regional leader in tourism by\n            2021. Project components are: 1) integrated development of\n            archeological parks and sites, will create and Archeological\n            Tourism Circuit by financing tourism infrastructure and\n            training in participatory management; 2) income generation\n            opportunities, will implement a program of formation for\n            populations in the project areas, particularly the very\n            poor; and 3) institutional development, will design and\n            implement institutional strengthening and communications,\n            and enhancements to the Project

development, infrastructure\n            development, and productive components under the Regional\n            Development in the Copan Valley Project, whose main\n            objective is to develop an archaeological/ecological tourist\n            route, within protected areas in Honduras. The project\n            design will take into consideration appropriate\n            environmental protection, to include as well appropriate\n            site selection for the construction works, roads, and access\n            roads rehabilitation, installation of power lines, and\n            facilities at large. The criteria for site selection should\n            take into account the national, state, and municipal\n            regulations to prevent adversity on rural lands, road\n            alignments, and land potentially prone to flooding,\n            earthquakes, or soil erosion, while existing flora and fauna\n            should be protected within its natural habitats. In\n            addition, land tenure issues that may potentially hamper\n            land acquisition due to legal problems, should be considered\n            early on, including any social issue that may arise.\n            Construction works will comply with specifications contained\n            in the bidding documents, which stipulate the following\n            activities within the project area, will be banned:\n            deforestation; fires; hunting, and/or fishing activities;\n            degradation of natural vegetation; and, damage on\n            architectural, or cultural heritage sites.

Protective\n            barriers should be installed to contain soil erosion,\n            particularly along roadsides, slopes, and land excavation\n            perimeters, while continual spraying of construction\n            surfaces should control air pollution. Further mitigation\n            addresses traffic safety measures, noise abatement, public\n            awareness campaigns, and environmental monitoring, and\n            supervision activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Regional Development in the Copan\n            Valley Project - environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Honduras - Desarrollo regional en\n            el Proyecto del Valle de Cop\u00e1n: Evaluaci\u00f3n ambiental"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/03/2176361/honduras-regional-development-copan-valley-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"HN-Regional Development In The Copan Valley\n            Project -- P081172","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Honduras","authors":{"authr":"Arjona Hincapie, Fabio"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03032604013947"},"admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","subsc":"Other industry,Agricultural extension and research,Micro- and SME finance,Vocational training,Sub-national government administration","lang":"Spanish","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Environmental assessment;
