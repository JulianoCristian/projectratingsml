The objectives of the Bank were correct insofar as\n            they sought to strengthen a regulatory authority in the\n            forestry sector and diversify the sector to compensate for\n            the depletion of Liberian mineral reserves. Institutional\n            development, and the Forestry Development Authority (FDA)\n            strengthening was the significant Project component. Other\n            than for the forest fee aspects and a staff to forest area\n            ratio, both of which are not perfect measures of efficiency,\n            no other specific and measurable objectives were set for\n            this component. FDA was already active and it may have been\n            preferable to summarize every divisions activities, their\n            weaknesses, and their missions, and then to set-specific\n            targets against which each section and division could be\n            measured. A newly created organization requires time to\n            assume its role in any sector of an economy and to acquire\n            the internal relationships and methods needed to fulfill\n            that role. Better strategies may have been to delay the\n            implementation of the Trial Industrial Plantation until the\n            strengthening of FDA had an effect, or to establish it as a\n            separate project but coordinated with FDA, or to have\n            awaited the outcome of development by the Liberian Forestry\n            Corporation (LFC)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Liberia -
