The\n            lessons learned indicate that the Project clearly\n            demonstrates that the institutional environment is key for a\n            Project aimed at supporting decentralization. Clear\n            commitment from the Government should be a prerequisite for\n            a support in this field. The difficult political situation\n            in Niger during Project preparation and, in particular, the\n            cancellation of the decentralization laws and the local\n            elections in 1996, should have been sufficient reasons to\n            design a more realistic institutional component. The Project\n            confirms that it is very difficult to deal with all cities\n            in the country at the same time. The delegation of contract\n            management and the reliance on the private sector\n            (consultants and Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs)) are\n            powerful and successful ways for municipalities to implement\n            their development and infrastructure programs.\n            Identification, planning and programming should not be left\n            under the responsibility of an Agetip Agency, as the\n            rationale for this is out of the core business of the Agency\n            and is likely to make decision making more difficult and\n            create strain between the Agency and the municipalities and\n            other beneficiaries. Municipalities need a minimum in-house\n            capacity in order to be able to benefit from the simple\n            management toolkit prepared through the Project (urban\n            audits, municipal audits, community consultations). The\n            requirement for counterpart funding from the municipalities,\n            as set up during Project preparation (up to 15%) was not\n            realistic and not at par with the economic and financial\n            situation prevailing in the country. Adequate training for\n            consultants (studies and supervision) and SMEs is needed to\n            ensure a satisfactory quality for the works ordered by the\n            municipalities. In addition to the training program\n            implemented by Public Works Executing Agency for Niger\n            (NIGETIP) itself, a strong external partner was needed to\n            ensure a sufficient impact of the sessions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Urban Infrastructure\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/10/2803925/niger-urban-infrastructure-rehabilitation-project","projn":"NE-Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            Project -- P049691","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Urban Governance and Management,Municipal Financial Management,Public Sector Management and Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Niger","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20031125134742"},"subsc":"Other domestic and international trade,Sub-national government administration,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Industry and trade,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets,audits,autonomy,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,Capacity Building,capitals,cities,City\n            Management,community participation,construction\n            industry,contractors,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,decision\n            making,depreciation,employment,Environmental\n            policies,exercises,FISCAL YEAR,housing,income,Institutional\n            Development,land management,land tenure,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,local administration,local\n            authorities,local government,local governments,local\n            level,management information systems,mayors,municipal\n            authorities,municipal development,municipal\n            infrastructure,municipal\n            level,Municipalities,Municipality,personality,Poverty\n            Reduction,Present Value,primary schools,private\n            sector,public transport,resource mobilization,social\n            services,technical assistance,urban areas,urban\n            development,urban environment,urban environmental\n            management,Urban Infrastructure,urban management,urban\n            management tools,urban services,wages,waste,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"assets,audits,autonomy,Bank Performance,Bank\n            supervision,Capacity Building,capitals,cities,City\n            Management,community participation,construction\n            industry,contractors,decentralization,decentralization\n            process,decision\n            making,depreciation,employment,Environmental\n            policies,exercises,FISCAL YEAR,housing,income,Institutional\n            Development,land management,land tenure,laws,legal\n            framework,legislation,local administration,local\n            authorities,local government,local governments,local\n            level,management information systems,mayors,municipal\n            authorities,municipal development,municipal\n            infrastructure,municipal\n            level,Municipalities,Municipality,personality,Poverty\n            Reduction,Present Value,primary schools,private\n            sector,public transport,resource mobilization,social\n            services,technical assistance,urban areas,urban\n            development,urban environment,urban environmental\n            management,Urban Infrastructure,urban management,urban\n            management tools,urban services,wages,waste,water supply"}},"owner":"AFT:  Urban/Water Francophone (AFTU2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF023976-FAC CONSULTANT TRUST FUND (USD A/C),TF024991-FRENCH CTF (FY97 ALLOCATIONS),TF031251-AFRICA - SOIL CARBON\n            SEQUESTRATION RES.,TF037368-NIGER - URBAN INFRAS.

This project could aggravate\n            this problem by producing the following major negative\n            impacts: 1) increased waterborne diseases associated with\n            the use of pond water; 2) detriments to the giraffe herd,\n            particularly habitat destruction and accidents; 3) disturbed\n            forest biotopes caused by opening quarries; 4) water\n            erosion; 5) silting from erosion of hill-slope quarries and\n            rock outcrops; 6) deforestation caused by overexploitation\n            and increased firewood consumption; 7) pollution due to\n            dust, exhaust gas emissions, and gasoline, gas-oil, and oil\n            vapors; and 8) vehicle noise nuisance. Offsetting measures\n            include 1) controlling felling of protected trees and\n            protecting sensitive habitats; 2) protecting the giraffe and\n            rehabilitating its habitats; 3) combating wind and water\n            erosion; 4) limiting vehicle speeds; 5) rehabilitating\n            quarries, borrow pits, and watersheds to provide water for\n            fauna and agriculture; and 6) conducting population training\n            and awareness-arousing programs.
