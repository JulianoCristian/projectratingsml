Armenia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: the government of Armenia used it\n            very effectively while trying to get the National Assembly\n            to adopt the law on 'conflict of interest'. These\n            outreach efforts were targeted at beneficiaries (poor and\n            middle class), parliamentary commissions and Civil Society\n            Organizations (CSOs) and finally led to the adoption of the\n            law. A well-designed development policy operation can be\n            effectively used to garner additional donor resources. Using\n            international rankings is inappropriate because rankings are\n            determined by relative performance and do not depend solely\n            on the individual government's efforts. In addition,\n            result indicators should be monitorable on an annual basis\n            and should not be based on periodic surveys. This was the\n            case for the cost of tax compliance survey which was\n            undertaken in 2009 and is now scheduled for 2014. Indicators\n            should also be clearly defined (what do we mean by\n            'poor') and realistic, maintaining an existing\n            Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) in the banking sector is\n            understandable at the time of crisis but targeting a CAR of\n            28 percent over the medium-term is not very realistic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - First, Second, and

          Policy Operation (DPO) Program for Armenia is to address\n            vulnerability by protecting the poor and supporting greater\n            human capital development, while improving competitiveness\n            by alleviating a selected set of private sector and\n            governance constraints. Armenia was among the worst affected\n            by the global crisis, notwithstanding its strong pre-crisis\n            performance on growth and poverty reduction. As exports,\n            remittances and foreign direct investment (FDI) fell, Gross\n            Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by more than 14 percent in\n            2009 due mainly to a precipitous decline in the booming\n            construction sector. Nearly 40 percent of households\n            suffered from losses of wages, farm income and remittances;\n            incidence of poverty rose from 23.5 to 26.5 percent of the\n            population after more than a decade of continuing decline.\n            The crisis impact also revealed the urgency of improving\n            competitiveness, especially in the tradable sectors, given\n            that construction is unlikely to be the major growth driver\n            as it has been in recent years. The DPO series, initiated in\n            2009, supports Government efforts to address vulnerabilities\n            resulting from the crisis and strengthen competitiveness for\n            post-crisis growth. In addressing vulnerability, the DPO\n            program protects the poor and sustains human capital\n            development by safeguarding social safety net spending and\n            its effectiveness, as well as by continuing reforms in\n            education and health. In strengthening competitiveness, the\n            DPO program alleviates private sector and governance\n            constraints through various measures to improve the business\n            environment and to enhance efficiency and accountability in\n            public financial management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Armenia - Second Development Policy\n            Operation
