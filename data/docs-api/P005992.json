Lessons during preparation\n            convey the importance of assessing the country's\n            implementation capacity in financial, technical, and legal\n            issues, to avoid delays, by establishing a qualified project\n            coordination team, and providing technical assistance in\n            Bank procedures prior to implementation, in addition to\n            developing an initial work program, budget, and a\n            procurement plan. Similarly, the establishment of a single\n            project coordination unit, particularly in light of multiple\n            sources of funding as in this case, should avoid\n            overlapping, and increase effectiveness. It is also at the\n            early stages of the project, that understanding of the\n            assumed decentralization model be made clear, including\n            knowledge of the envisaged roles of the different national,\n            and provincial authorities, and responsibilities. During\n            implementation, lessons once again reinforce the need for\n            community participation, and stakeholder involvement,\n            because it significantly reduces resistance to change, and\n            ensures ownership. Regrettably, the project would have\n            greatly improved had a well-designed, and fully operational,\n            monitoring and evaluation system been in place as of the\n            early stages, providing flexibility to correct course, and,\n            as a powerful tool to lay the grounds for discussions on\n            policy actions, and investments in education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -

Additionally, the project will strengthen\n            institutional capacity by: 1) modernizing sector management;\n            2) improving administrative efficiency; and 3) improving\n            productivity .
