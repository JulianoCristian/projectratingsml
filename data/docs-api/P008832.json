Both the Bank\n            and the borrower performances were moderately satisfactory.\n            Findings of the project include: There was strong support\n            for the most critical and immediate investments needed to\n            improve the operation of the water and wastewater systems.\n            There was limited improvement of system operations,\n            reduction of operational costs and improvement of service\n            quality and there were some improvements related to\n            institutional and commercial reforms aimed at improving\n            physical system operations and financial performance of\n            vodokanals. The main lessons learned from the project are:\n            A) Project objectives should be closely tailored to the\n            capacity of the government and related agencies to implement\n            the Project and to the conditions of the enabling\n            environment existing at the time of Project preparation. B)\n            Small borrowers pay a relatively large cost to comply with\n            conventional Bank fiduciary requirements.
