Some lessons learned included:\n            behavior change takes time, particularly in countries like\n            Jamaica with complex socio-cultural environments.\n            Consequently, it is important that the anticipated outcomes\n            recognize and take into account: (a) the time lag between\n            activities and results; (b) the potential challenges in\n            setting and achieving Project targets; (c) the inputs and\n            strategies needed to effect change; and (d) importantly,\n            emerging options such as the use of treatment as prevention.\n            During project preparation, the overall environment for\n            procurement should be assessed, and the design of\n            procurement arrangements should balance transparency and\n            accountability with effective implementation. For instance,\n            higher thresholds for requiring competitive bidding should\n            be considered, along with some relaxation or flexibility of\n            the need to obtain three quotations under the shopping\n            method should be considered. This is particularly critical\n            in small island states like Jamaica with limited numbers of\n            local vendors, and small quantities, which make bidding\n            unattractive to external vendors. In addition, the weak\n            capacity, particularly in procurement could have been\n            addressed through more hand holding and training to prevent\n            some delays."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Second HIV/AIDS Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Second HIV/AIDS

The\n            changes will allow the project to complete the activities\n            that started late due to delayed budget allocation because\n            of the negative impact of the global economic down-turn on\n            the Government's budget. The reallocation will take\n            into account the actual costs and future needs of project\n            implementation and the four month grace period will allow\n            the project to complete payments after the project closing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica -
