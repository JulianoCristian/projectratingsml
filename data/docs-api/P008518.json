The sustainability of the reform process is\n            likely for two reasons: 1) The new law and regulatory\n            authority provide a legal basis for the continuance of the\n            reform. 2) The President has taken a personal interest in\n            the sector and has requested IFC financing for the\n            Information and Communications Technologies sector. Overall\n            world Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory because\n            Bank staff maintained a close dialogue with the government,\n            provided techical assistance on key issues, and factored in\n            global changes in the ICT sector into the progress of the\n            project. Borrower performance is rated satisfactory overall.\n            Some of the lessons learned include: First, training and\n            capacity building are a necessary component in projects\n            seeking to introduce technological and institutional\n            innovation. Second, projects with long durations need to\n            take into account significant changes in the sector, and\n            adjust project objectives to respond to these changes.\n            Third, it is important to leverage potential synergies\n            between multiple operations in any country in order to\n            achieve sector and development objectives. Fourth, the\n            failure of privatization and the erosion of investor\n            confidence caused by the dispute with the privatization\n            advisor demonstrated that it is crucial for the government\n            to establish appropriate contractual arrangements. Fifth,\n            sound project design and implementation helped the reform\n            process withstand major setbacks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Telecommunications
