Further\n            objectives are: to broaden and deepen financial\n            intermediation, to provide an enabling business environment\n            and increase the private sector's economy share.\n            Furthermore, the loan will provide Jordan with short-term\n            balance of payments support in order to strengthen its\n            international reserves position.  The ERDL-II supports trade\n            and investment policy reforms to: a) further reduce\n            anti-export bias, to foster integration with world market,\n            and reduce

    special privileges; d) encourage long-term saving and\n            promote development of new financial instruments and\n            markets; e) encourage entry, improve incentives, and offer\n            national treatment to foreign investors; f) modernize a\n            broad range of business laws; and g) improve opportunities\n            for private sector firms, increase competition,
