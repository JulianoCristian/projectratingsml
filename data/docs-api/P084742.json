Some important project lessons\n            learned were: (a) the project has demonstrated that it is\n            possible to provide a climate adaptation focus to most water\n            and agriculture-related investments. Even with on-going\n            agriculture and irrigation projects, retrofitting an already\n            existing program to include integrated measures with a\n            climate adaptation focus is not difficult. (b) The usual\n            approach to intensification of irrigated agriculture is\n            investment in infrastructure, in many cases, completely new.\n            The project has demonstrated that identifying ways to\n            improve efficiency of the water resource already available,\n            obtaining real water savings, and improving water\n            productivity should be the approach. This can be achieved\n            with minimal investment, with huge gains to be realized. (c)\n            It is eminently desirable to ensure that there are\n            activities focused on knowledge generation, analyses,\n            capacity building, and creation of an intellectual\n            underpinning for an innovative operation which incorporates\n            climate adaptation. (d) It is critical to get all of the\n            stakeholders to buy into the program. Dissemination of\n            information to civil society and to government officials and\n            political leaders to obtain their support to implement such\n            initiatives was a key success factor. (e) Strengthened\n            cooperation with research institutions and scientists and\n            experts, and timely transformation of the latest research on\n            climate change adaptation into practical action provided\n            strong scientific and technical support for project design\n            and implementation, and guided adaptation practices on the ground."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Third Irrigated Agriculture\n            Intensification Project and Mainstreaming Climate Change\n            Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture

of the Mainstreaming\n            Climate Change Adaptation in Irrigated Agriculture Project\n            in China of are : to enhance adaptation to climate change in\n            agriculture and irrigation water management practices\n            through awareness-raising, institutional and capacity\n            strengthening, and demonstration activities in the\n            Huang-Huai-Hai Basin (3H Basin). This will help mainstream\n            climate change adaptation measures, techniques, and\n            activities into the national Comprehensive Agricultural\n            Development (CAD) Program which is China's largest\n            national investment program in irrigated agriculture. There\n            are three components to the project. The first component is\n            the identification and prioritization of adaptation options.\n            The second component is the demonstration and implementation\n            of adaptation measures. The purpose of this component is to\n            introduce, demonstrate and implement the specific adaptation\n            measures in selected demonstration areas, and adjust and\n            integrate appropriate adaptation measures into the\n            implementation of the Third Irrigated Agriculture\n            Intensification Project (IAIL3), in order to reduce\n            vulnerability to climate change in the 3H Basin. Finally,\n            the third component is the mainstreaming adaptation into\n            national CAD program and institutional strengthening. The\n            component will aim at integrating and mainstreaming climate\n            change adaptation into the national CAD program, including a\n            series of capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge\n            sharing, public awareness activities, and preparation of a\n            national climate change adaptation plan for CAD by State\n            Office of Comprehensive Agricultural Development (SOCAD),\n            with the close cooperation of Chinese Academy of Sciences\n            (CAS), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC)\n
