The\n            main objectives of Power V were to: continue ongoing sector\n            policy reforms, which had begun to help improve the\n            technical and commercial efficiency of Electricity\n            Corporation of Ghana (ECG), enhance ECG's capability to\n            deliver a reliable, economic supply of electricity to its\n            customers, and assist Government of Ghana (GOG) in\n            developing a long-term power sector development strategy and\n            an electrification program. The project's outcome\n            overall was satisfactory with respect to most of its\n            technical and institutional objectives.
