were\n            as follows: outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development\n            outcome was low or negligible, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: targeting is a\n            key element of implementing successful social protection\n            interventions. It will be imperative that further targeting\n            reviews are done to the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP)\n            and other key social protection programs. Such reviews\n            should be encouraged as part of implementation both at the\n            geographical and household levels and results used to make\n            design improvements in the programs. Harmonization and\n            alignment of donor and Government of Rwanda (GoR)\n            interventions reduce transaction costs for the GoR and\n            translate into better programmatic interventions. Timing of\n            bank support, especially in a program with far-reaching\n            impacts, to coincide with bank's Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) and the inception of a government program,\n            can be critical. The existence of decentralized governance\n            and management structures highly facilitates successful\n            implementation of community-targeted social protection\n            reforms. Parallel technical assistance support to a\n            Development Policy Lending (DPL) operation is the key to\n            successful reforms. Continuous systems analysis and taking\n            corrective action should be part and parcel of the\n            implementation process. There is a growing body of empirical\n            evidence of the use of incentives to reward health service\n            provides for specific types of results and to motivate\n            individuals for health-related behaviors. Investing in\n            collaboration with a national research team not only\n            strengthens in-country capacity in this technical area, but\n            also contributes greatly to the successful implementation,\n            management and ownership of an evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Community Living Standards Grants\n            or Credit Program

          Credit Program development objective is to support the\n            Government of Rwanda's (GoR's) social protection\n            and health policy reforms designed to reduce extreme\n            poverty, initially in 30 pilot sectors, and to expand access\n            to high-impact health, nutrition and population\n            interventions at the community level. The program is the\n            third and final phase of a three-year community living\n            standards grant/credit development policy operation in\n            Rwanda that is consistent with the second Country Assistance\n            Strategy (CAS) theme. The operation supports GoR's\n            poverty reduction objectives, consistent with the\n            country's fiscal framework and the second strategic\n            theme of the CAS, which is to reduce social vulnerability\n            and - to ensure that the most vulnerable Rwandans also\n            benefit from growth and to help Rwanda make further progress\n            in building a more stable society. The operation supports\n            policy reforms in the public works and direct support\n            components of the Vision 2020 Umurenge Program (VUP) and\n            helps Rwanda get on track with child and maternal mortality\n            goals. It aims to achieve quick results in the areas of\n            poverty reduction and improved health outcomes, even in the\n            midst of the ongoing global economic and financial crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Third Community Living Standards\n            Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Third Community Living\n            Standards Credit
