Lessons convey the\n            following. The need for clear objectives at appraisal, is\n            once again being reinforced, particularly important if, as\n            in this case, the weight of preparation predominantly fell\n            on Bank staff, and consultants, rather than on the\n            Government itself. Consequently, during implementation, it\n            appeared the Government was not prepared to use project\n            funds for expenditures such as emergency, and technical\n            assistance, although funding provision was included. Thus,\n            the Bank should support the Government in seeking a blend of\n            credit, and grant funding through co-financing for\n            operations requiring substantial assistance as specified\n            above, in partnership with nongovernmental organizations.\n            While the project was designed as a three year pilot\n            operation, it turned into a seven year rural development\n            operation, and although there is recognition for its\n            management flexibility, it is suggested pilot activities\n            should be limited in size, with provision for effective\n            monitoring, and evaluation systems, backed by strong Bank\n            supervision. Nonetheless, following restructuring, the\n            project focused on micro-projects, primarily on the\n            rehabilitation, and development of social, and rural\n            infrastructure, proving that simple, targeted activities\n            greatly contribute to the success of such operations. As for\n            land use mapping, project design should ensure that such an\n            expensive tool, be part of a comprehensive strategy for land\n            policy development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Rural Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Rural Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1490105/mozambique-rural-rehabilitation-project","projn":"MZ-Rural Rehabilitation -- P001796","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water and Industry,Urban Services to the Poor,Health Economics & Finance,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Mozambique","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01071204054822"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Water supply","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to drinking water,agricultural\n            activities,Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,beneficiary communities,catchment area,child\n            health,clean water,clean water supply,Community\n            Education,community groups,community leaders,community\n            participation,construction,Counterpart funding,district\n            authorities,drinking water,employment,hand\n            pump,households,infant mortality,irrigation systems,joint\n            venture,land cover,land titling,land use,living\n            standards,local capacity,local communities,maintenance\n            costs,Natural Resources,neighborhoods,private\n            companies,private sector,project management,provincial\n            governments,provincial water,public works,pumps,remote\n            sensing,roads,rural communities,Rural Water,Rural Water\n            Supply,Sanitation,Schools,sectoral investment,social\n            development,social services,towns,Water Department,Water\n            Departments,Water Point,Water Points,water source,water\n            sources,water supply systems"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to drinking water,agricultural\n            activities,Agricultural Development,agricultural\n            production,beneficiary communities,catchment area,child\n            health,clean water,clean water supply,Community\n            Education,community groups,community leaders,community\n            participation,construction,Counterpart funding,district\n            authorities,drinking water,employment,hand\n            pump,households,infant mortality,irrigation systems,joint\n            venture,land cover,land titling,land use,living\n            standards,local capacity,local communities,maintenance\n            costs,Natural Resources,neighborhoods,private\n            companies,private sector,project management,provincial\n            governments,provincial water,public works,pumps,remote\n            sensing,roads,rural communities,Rural Water,Rural Water\n            Supply,Sanitation,Schools,sectoral investment,social\n            development,social services,towns,Water Department,Water\n            Departments,Water Point,Water Points,water source,water\n            sources,water supply systems"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026530-TAGPE - ENVIR.

The Distribution of\n            Agpacks Component will provide seeds and hand tools to\n            smallholders returning to their traditional lands after the\n            war. The Rural Water Supply Component will increase the\n            coverage of the rural water supply, improve the organization\n            and management of provincial water supply institutions, and\n            stimulate community participation in the operation and\n            maintenance of the systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique - Rural Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mozambique - Rural Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1992/12/736347/mozambique-rural-rehabilitation-project","projn":"MZ-Rural Rehabilitation -- P001796","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Banks & Banking Reform,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Agricultural Research","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Mozambique","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961003223354"},"subsc":"Sub-national government administration,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector,Central government administration,Water supply","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,African Development\n            Bank,agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Marketing,agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural\n            Training,Agriculture,Auditing,Audits,beans,capacity\n            building,capital gains,capitals,cassava,central\n            planning,commercial banks,commodities,community\n            participation,cotton,crops,debt,Decentralization,diet,exchange\n            rate,exploitation,extension,farmers,farms,Financial\n            Management,fiscal deficits,FISCAL YEAR,food crops,food\n            grains,food needs,foreign exchange,Gender,GIS,government\n            expenditures,Households,imports,income,inflation,Insurance,interest\n            rates,Inventory,Irrigation,joint venture,joint\n            ventures,labor force,land reform,land resources,Land\n            Tenure,land use,lands,legal\n            framework,legislation,legumes,Local Administration,local\n            authorities,maize,migration,MOA,NGOs,parasites,Potable\n            Water,private property,private\n            sector,producers,profitability,Property rights,provincial\n            water,real prices,rice,roots,Rural Development,Rural\n            Infrastructure,rural population,Rural Water,Rural Water\n            Supply,social services,soil conservation,soil\n            fertility,soils,sorghum,state enterprises,Technical\n            Assistance,terms of trade,transport,trees,UNDP,United\n            Nations,urban areas,urban\n            centers,USAID,vegetables,violence,Water Supply,Water Supply Service"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,African Development\n            Bank,agricultural development,Agricultural\n            Marketing,agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,Agricultural\n            Training,Agriculture,Auditing,Audits,beans,capacity\n            building,capital gains,capitals,cassava,central\n            planning,commercial banks,commodities,community\n            participation,cotton,crops,debt,Decentralization,diet,exchange\n            rate,exploitation,extension,farmers,farms,Financial\n            Management,fiscal deficits,FISCAL YEAR,food crops,food\n            grains,food needs,foreign exchange,Gender,GIS,government\n            expenditures,Households,imports,income,inflation,Insurance,interest\n            rates,Inventory,Irrigation,joint venture,joint\n            ventures,labor force,land reform,land resources,Land\n            Tenure,land use,lands,legal\n            framework,legislation,legumes,Local Administration,local\n            authorities,maize,migration,MOA,NGOs,parasites,Potable\n            Water,private property,private\n            sector,producers,profitability,Property rights,provincial\n            water,real prices,rice,roots,Rural Development,Rural\n            Infrastructure,rural population,Rural Water,Rural Water\n            Supply,social services,soil conservation,soil\n            fertility,soils,sorghum,state enterprises,Technical\n            Assistance,terms of trade,transport,trees,UNDP,United\n            Nations,urban areas,urban\n            centers,USAID,vegetables,violence,Water Supply,Water Supply Service"}},"owner":"AFT: ESSD 1 (AFTS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026530-TAGPE - ENVIR.
