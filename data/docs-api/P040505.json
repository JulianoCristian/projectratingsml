The Bank responded\n            quickly to address the urgent rehabilitation needs of the\n            sector. With continuous security concerns and extended\n            border closures, implementation delays were inevitable.\n            However, despite  the continuous threat and instability,\n            close monitoring of the implementation activities ultimately\n            led to the  completion of all the major components. All\n            through the implementation period, the Bank was flexible;\n            this  demonstrated adequate responsiveness towards\n            Borrower's changing needs and priorities. Reallocation\n            of  funds between components and between other projects (in\n            the same sector) were formalized whenever  necessary.\n            Although the effectiveness of the institutional\n            strengthening component was modest with  regards to building\n            the Palestinian water Authority's (PWA) regulatory\n            capacity, adequate support through the provision of\n            necessary technical assistance  ultimately helped in\n            creation of a solid project management unit and in the\n            adoption of the new Water Law that led to the  creation of\n            the Water and Wastewater Company for Gaza. Finally, the\n            overall project framework created  the necessary environment\n            for other donors to provide much needed funds for the\n            sector. In view of the  above, the overall Bank performance\n            is considered to be highly satisfactory. Overall borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some of the lessons\n            learned included the following: 1) Borrower's strong\n            commitment for development of the sector  through the\n            Project was a key factor that not only helped formulate the\n            Project concept/design but also  facilitated its\n            implementation at every successive stage. 2) In Gaza, where\n            no regulatory capacity existed before the management\n            contract  went into effect, the contracting of an\n            independent reputable auditing firm proved to be essential\n            in  building trust between the public and private parties\n            involved. 3) The management contract experience in Gaza,\n            suggests that providing higher  degrees of management\n            responsibility to the operator can expedite system improvements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Water and Sanitation\n            Services Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza - Water and\n            Sanitation Services Project  : West Bank and Gaza - Water\n            and Sanitation Services Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2410303/west-bank-gaza-water-sanitation-services-project-west-bank-gaza-water-sanitation-services-project","projn":"GZ-Water & San.
