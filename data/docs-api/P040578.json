Lessons learned from the\n            project: Designing and phasing projects to respond to\n            political and technical realities leads to better\n            implementation progress. Implementing activities with\n            multi-agency responsibility needs clear agreement on\n            responsibilities and very explicit implementing\n            arrangements, without which road safety activities remain a\n            challenge. Working with governments to bring about\n            institutional changes is a challenge and is likely to fail\n            unless there is clear Government commitment and there is\n            involvement from all Government ministries not just the\n            implementing ministry.
