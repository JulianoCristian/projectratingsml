Some lessons learned included: a\n            development policy operation can be an effective instrument\n            for addressing key issues in restoring a functional\n            government and contribute to setting the stage for deeper\n            reforms. A programmatic series of DPOs may be better than\n            stand-alone Development Policy Operations (DPOs), which may\n            provide a timely response to exogenous shocks but could lead\n            to inappropriate sequencing of the reforms over the medium\n            term. Going forward the new DPO series should seek to link\n            more strongly the public sector and economic governance\n            reforms with measures to promote private sector development.\n            A two-tranche budget support operation can be effective in\n            supporting the continuation of reforms, especially in\n            fragile countries. The project, a two-tranche grant\n            disbursing on agreed conditions, helped maintain the focus\n            on critical reforms and ensured that the Bank remain engaged\n            in policy dialogue with the authorities before and after the\n            elections. The second tranche helped support the\n            government's efforts to restore fiscal discipline\n            following election-related slippages. Its disbursement\n            helped clear arrears which, in turn, permitted other donors\n            including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\n            African Development Bank to move forward with their support\n            program. In a fragile post-conflict country such as the CAR,\n            Technical Assistance (TA) should be available to help\n            implement the reform program supported by the DPO and build\n            up capacity in key areas. TA should promote synergies and\n            built on them. The policy measures under the project that\n            were most successfully implemented were those that benefited\n            from greater cooperation among the departments and units\n            concerned. To help build robust budget processes, reforms\n            should be closely monitored and a close dialogue with the\n            government should be maintained through frequent supervision\n            missions and a strong field presence."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Third Economic\n            Management and Governance Reform Grant

Third Economic Management and\n            Governance Reform Grant Program (EMGRG III) for Central\n            African Republic (CAR) is the fourth in a series of\n            development policy operations (DPOs) that began with the\n            Reengagement and Institution-Building Support Program in\n            2006. It builds on the preceding DPOs and continues to\n            support the implementation of CAR's poverty reduction\n            strategy, as set out in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper\n            adopted by the Government in September 2007. The operation\n            supports the Government's efforts to mitigate the\n            economic and poverty impact of the global economic slowdown.\n            The EMGRG III is designed as a two-tranche operation to give\n            the authorities the time needed to implement the proposed\n            tranche release conditions in the context of an evolving\n            electoral process. The reform program has been developed\n            jointly with the Government and in close collaboration with\n            other donors active in CAR. Also the government and other\n            budget support donors as a group have agreed on the EMGRG\n            III tranche release conditions. The European Union and\n            African Development Bank intend to provide parallel external\n            financing to help mitigate the impact of the global\n            financial crisis and support the implementation of the\n            government's poverty reduction strategy. The operation\n            is consistent with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            supported program under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African
