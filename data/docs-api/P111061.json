Based on the revised\n            procurement plan, the project management team is actively\n            processing the various activities identified in the plan.\n            The closing date of the project was June 30, 2011. However\n            the implementation of the project faced delays due to number\n            of factors of which the major ones are: a) delays in signing\n            and mobilization of the technical assistance for the project\n            management team; b) the prevailing conditions in the country\n            in relation to preparation for and carrying out of the\n            national referendum which took place in January, 2011; and\n            c) the rebidding of the major work contracts that was\n            necessitated following a necessary repackaging to attract\n            more competition from contractors. The Multi-Donor Trust\n            Fund for Southern Sudan which was originally going too\n            closed on June 30, 2011, has now been extended by the\n            oversight committee to June 30, 2012."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan - Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14439747/sudan-water-supply-sanitation-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"SS-Southern Sudan - Water Supply And\n            Sanitation Project -- P111061","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Water Resources Assessment,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Sudan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110623002300"},"subsc":"Public administration- Water, sanitation and\n            flood protection,Water supply,Sanitation","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to safe water, access to safe water\n            supply, boreholes, capacity building, Community Water,\n            Compliance Monitoring, construction, Dams, design of water,\n            distribution facilities, Distribution System, distribution\n            systems, Environmental management, ground water, ground\n            waters, Hand pumps, hand-dug wells, household sanitation,\n            hygiene, hygiene promotion, Irrigation, latrines, pipeline,\n            Project Management, public latrines, reservoirs, riparian\n            countries, RVP, safe water supply, Sanitation, sanitation\n            component, sanitation facilities, sanitation systems,\n            sanitation utilities, spring protection, spring protection\n            systems, urban areas, urban water, Water Directorate, Water\n            Distribution, Water Distribution System, water points, water\n            quality, water reservoirs, Water resource, Water resource\n            management, water resources, water resources planning, Water\n            Supply, water supply distribution, wells"}},"owner":"Urban Dev. & Services Prac 1 (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF096197-South Sudan Water Supply and\n            Sanitation Project","repnb":"62552"},"facets":{}}}
