The project achieved its\n            objectives, its impact on institutional development was\n            substantial, sustainability is likely, and the performance\n            of both the Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, project\n            design must take into account the presence of qualified\n            personnel in the civil service who only need to undertake\n            training in order to update their skills. Second, the fact\n            that the TA was not permanent led to a real transfer of\n            knowledge throughout the project's life. Third, there\n            was a clear understanding with the Borrower that expert\n            intervention would only take place upon completion of\n            specific tasks and sanctions would be made if these tasks\n            were not completed as agreed. Fourth, flexibility on the\n            part of the Bank aided in the project's success and\n            consistent actions have been retained in future operations.\n            Finally, future operations can build upon the TA experience\n            gained through this project, thereby allowing for a\n            consistent Bank strategy in the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire -
