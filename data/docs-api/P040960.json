The sharp\n            improvement in positioning the business enterprises, was due\n            to the successful project implementation.

It is\n            suggested, the Project Implementation Units (PIUs) should\n            ensure that participating enterprises cover a feasible\n            implementation plan, to be studied well ahead of time.\n            Furthermore, the provision of detailed information on the\n            Bank's procurement guidelines and procedures should be\n            enhanced, thus local enterprises would acquire a broader\n            knowledge of the benefits stemming from international\n            competitive bidding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovenia - Technical Support and Investment\n            Project for the Phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Slovenia - Technical Support and\n            Investment Project for the Phaseout of Ozone Depleting Substances"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/01/728068/slovenia-technical-support-investment-project-phaseout-ozone-depleting-substances","projn":"SI-Ozone Depleting Substances (Ods) Phaseout\n            Project -- P040960","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Environmental Economics & Policies,Montreal Protocol,General Technology,Global Environment Facility","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Slovenia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99031910570457"},"subsc":"Banking,Health,Other industry,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aerosol propellants,aerosols,air,alternative\n            technologies,Carbon,Carbon\n            Tetrachloride,CFC,CFCs,chlorofluorocarbons,co,Copenhagen\n            Amendment,Cost Effectiveness,cost\n            savings,cyclopentane,developed countries,Dimethyl\n            Ether,Expenditures,financial viability,foams,Global\n            Warming,Global Warming Potential,GWP,halons,HCFC,hydrocarbon\n            aerosol\n            propellant,hydrochlorofluorocarbons,imports,incineration,innovations,insulation,isobutane,Legislation,London\n            Amendment,MFMP,Montreal Protocol,Montreal Protocol on\n            Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,Motivation,new\n            technology,nitrogen,ODS,Ozone,Ozone Depleting\n            Potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,Ozone Layer\n            Depletion,Perchloroethylene,Pharmaceuticals,polyethylene,Product\n            development,recipient\n            countries,Reclamation,Recycling,refrigeration,rigid PU\n            foams,solvents,sterilization,stratospheric ozone\n            layer,Sustainable Development,technical\n            assistance,technicians,technological\n            leadership,temperature,UNEP,waste,waste management,weather"},"1":{"cdata!":"aerosol propellants,aerosols,air,alternative\n            technologies,Carbon,Carbon\n            Tetrachloride,CFC,CFCs,chlorofluorocarbons,co,Copenhagen\n            Amendment,Cost Effectiveness,cost\n            savings,cyclopentane,developed countries,Dimethyl\n            Ether,Expenditures,financial viability,foams,Global\n            Warming,Global Warming Potential,GWP,halons,HCFC,hydrocarbon\n            aerosol\n            propellant,hydrochlorofluorocarbons,imports,incineration,innovations,insulation,isobutane,Legislation,London\n            Amendment,MFMP,Montreal Protocol,Montreal Protocol on\n            Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,Motivation,new\n            technology,nitrogen,ODS,Ozone,Ozone Depleting\n            Potential,Ozone Depleting Substances,Ozone Layer\n            Depletion,Perchloroethylene,Pharmaceuticals,polyethylene,Product\n            development,recipient\n            countries,Reclamation,Recycling,refrigeration,rigid PU\n            foams,solvents,sterilization,stratospheric ozone\n            layer,Sustainable Development,technical\n            assistance,technicians,technological\n            leadership,temperature,UNEP,waste,waste management,weather"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF028305-GEF1-SLOVENIA TECH.
