     help ensure implementation of sound macroeconomic policies,\n            and achieve strong sectoral reforms, to create an\n            environment conducive to private sector-led economic growth\n            in Mauritania. This project is a one tranche operation,\n            designed to harmonize the corporate, and personal tax regime\n            with its neighbor countries, particularly, the Arab\n            Maghrebian Union, and with Mali, and Senegal, its partners\n            under the Organisation de la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve\n            Senegal (OMVS). The operation aims at aligning its external\n            tariffs with neighboring countries, while continuing to\n            implement macroeconomic policies, though structural reforms,\n            and a poverty reduction strategy. Furthermore, the project\n            will facilitate the country's economic integration,\n            both regionally, and globally. Over the medium- and\n            long-term, the direct tax reform, and tariff alignment,\n            should assist Mauritania's growth, through the\n            improvement of resource mobilization, and private investment\n            flows, as well as through economic diversification, and\n            external trade. Education, health, and poverty reduction\n            programs will be enhanced through efficient public\n            expenditure allocations, with significant impacts on poverty\n            reduction. Risks are mitigated by the fact that the\n            government has already taken actions on the divestiture\n            program, and on a number of reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Fiscal
