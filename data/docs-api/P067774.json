Ratings for the National\n            Community Development Project (NCDP) for Jamaica are as\n            follows: outcome was moderately satisfactory; risk to the\n            development outcome was moderately; Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory; and Borrower performance was\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned include: the SSNP demonstrated\n            that conditional cash transfer programs, such as Program of\n            Advancement through Health and Education (PATH), can be\n            useful tools for protecting the poor after localized shocks.\n            Path was able to quickly double benefit levels and waives\n            compliance requirements in communities seriously affected by\n            Hurricane Ivan, but only to those already participating in\n            the program. Monitoring and evaluation in conditional cash\n            transfer programs should pay more attention to the objective\n            of protecting the chronically poor and vulnerable. Six of\n            the eight SSNP performance indicators reflected human\n            development outcomes. No indicators measured the extent to\n            which social assistance benefits effectively reached the\n            poor. Social Investment Funds, such as Jamaica Social\n            Investment Fund (JSIF), can be useful for dealing with\n            emergencies and for experimenting with new approaches. The\n            NCDP proved flexible in addressing the urgent need caused by\n            Hurricane Ivan and for helping communities gain experience\n            with community contracting. However, uncertainties about a\n            fund's longevity may create ambiguity about\n            responsibilities for continuing activities and sustaining\n            the benefits. The delivery of infrastructure through SIF\n            needs to be accompanied by measures that ensure the\n            effective use, operation, and maintenance of assets. When\n            using a SIF to help provide community chosen investments\n            quickly, it is also important to explicitly delineate the\n            responsibilities for operating and maintaining the social\n            infrastructure and to ensure that the capacity for service\n            provision and infrastructure maintenance is built."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Social

Accordingly,\n            Borrowers interested in implementing conditional cash\n            transfer schemes in their countries need to ensure the\n            financial and technical resources to continuously launch and\n            target intensive social marketing campaigns. Sporadic\n            dissemination campaigns are not effective or efficient.
