Some lessons learned\n            included: in the context of multi-sector operations, it is\n            important to ensure the coherence of the various PDOs. In\n            the case of this DPL, PDO 3 was less connected than the\n            other two PDOs and of a level of technical and political\n            complexity that was incompatible with that of an integrated\n            multi-sector operation. When there are substantial delays\n            between approval and effectiveness, reappraisal may be\n            warranted. In the case of this operation, almost two years\n            elapsed between approval and effectiveness. By then, the\n            baselines and many of the targets within the Results\n            Framework were obsolete. Sub-national operations offer great\n            potential for cross-fertilization and economies of scale. As\n            illustrated by this operation, successful innovations\n            supported under subnational operations can be easily\n            replicated in other states and municipalities. Likewise,\n            there is potential for vertical economies of scale and\n            homogenization by interacting with municipal, state and\n            federal actors simultaneously. When working at the\n            sub-national level, it is critical to maintain close\n            coordination with the federal government to ensure the\n            seamless integration of federally funded programs with\n            subnational policies. Ongoing changes in patterns in public\n            participation and service delivery may deserve a more\n            in-depth exploration. This operation points to an ongoing\n            shift away from traditional in-person forms of communication\n            (i.e., committees, assemblies, community meetings, in-person\n            customer service) to emerging forms of online communication\n            (i.e., on-line discussion boards and blogs, interest groups,\n            online customer service). This presents a good opportunity\n            for the Bank to review participatory and service provision\n            strategies under the new citizen engagement framework that\n            has just been set."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -

Belo Horizonte\n            Inclusive Urban Development Policy Loan Project for Brazil\n            is to support integrated and sustainable urban development\n            and reduce social vulnerability in Belo Horizonte. This\n            program document presents a proposed one tranche Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL) to the Municipality of Belo Horizonte (BH)\n            in the amount of US$200 million. Proactive integrated urban\n            development strategies are urgently needed to address social\n            exclusion, and create effective and long-term sustainable\n            governance to benefit all residents. The value added of this\n            operation lies in the potential knowledge partnership with\n            the municipality. Belo Horizonte can become a leading\n            laboratory of experimentation with new urban planning and\n            management ideas and processes, in light of the knowledge\n            the Bank brings to the client in specific issues such as\n            housing development, resettlement practices, social\n            programs, climate change adaptation and mitigation and\n            results-based management. The operation began preparation in\n            2011 and has experienced delays; however no slippage or\n            reversal of prior actions has occurred during this time. The\n            operation was appraised and negotiated with the client\n            during 2011-2012. The project has been pending resolution of\n            internal clearances within the client administration, which\n            have since been resolved. It has been confirmed that the\n            project's prior actions continue to guide municipal\n            policy and remain valid."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brasil - Empr\u00e9stimo de Pol\u00edtica
