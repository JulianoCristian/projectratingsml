Both the\n            World Bank and Borrower prformances are assessed as\n            satisfactory overall. Four lessons to be learned were\n            gleaned from this project: First, a sound donor coordination\n            framework is key to success. With their different strengths\n            and program objectives, donors must fit into a national\n            assistance strategy which is coordinated by Government, and\n            donors must be willing to work together. Second, All\n            potential stakeholders should be part of the discussion\n            regarding planning for a hospital in their area. When\n            specialized hospital units are established and equipped,\n            sub-national/local capacities and needs (the epidemiological\n            situation; population size; availability of qualified\n            prsonnel such as technical, administrative, and management\n            staff; and geographical and financial accessibility) should\n            be considered along with relying on national standards.\n            Third, field visits improve the accuracy of cost estimates,\n            particularly where there has not been wide experience in the\n            type of construction or civil works envisioned or areas have\n            not been fully accessible. Fourth, benefits from outsourcing\n            management tasks are potentially great, but success\n            ultimately depends on the competence, experience, and\n            reliability of the management agent. Further, the size of\n            contractual responsibilities must be considered: the\n            management agent should not be made responsible for areas\n            beyond his competence."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chad -
