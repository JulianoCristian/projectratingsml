Specifically, the project\n            pilot-tests whether Vanuatu can effectively deliver a\n            package of innovations intended to help the country move\n            toward its objective of Education for All, defined as formal\n            basic education of good quality through year 8. There are\n            two main project components. The first comprises five\n            sub-components: It expands access to primary school and\n            increases educational quality by improving community\n            participation through annual community consultations, and\n            enlisting community support to construct or repair\n            pre-schools, repair primary-year classrooms, and construct\n            housing for community secondary school teachers. This\n            component also strengthens collaborative relationships with\n            parents, teachers, and other community members to upgrade\n            educational quality; partners with nongovernmental\n            organizations to operate pre-schools in pilot communities;\n            provides educational equipment and learning materials; and\n            builds community secondary schools. The second component\n            funds capacity enhancement with technical assistance for\n            vernacular language development, curriculum development,\n            teacher training, and project and sector management, the\n            latter to include policy and program studies, school\n            mapping, and site and facility surveys."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vanuatu - Second
