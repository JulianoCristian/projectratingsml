Ownership and commitment at the\n            highest level of government is the key to successful\n            implementation and achievement of project outcomes. 2.\n            Synergistic opportunities presented by a multi-sector\n            investment cum program operation must be identified and\n            taken into account during implementation. Outcomes across\n            sectors could have been achieved more efficiently if the\n            project design and implementation had taken these potential\n            linkages into consideration. 3. Close coordination with the\n            government and implementing agency helps both partners to\n            pro-actively take corrective measures in the light of\n            changing situation in the state, in order that the project\n            is on track to meet the project development objectives. 4.\n            Proper baseline data and monitoring and evaluation systems\n            are a must to track progress. 5. Continuous review of\n            information collected to ensure consistency with chosen\n            indicators is important. 6. Revising indicators as well as\n            data collection methodologies, if indicators cannot be\n            measured as stated and strengthening the feedback into\n            implementation. 7. Continuity of personnel, adequate and\n            timely release of funds, training of staff and timely\n            decision making go a long way in ensuring successful project\n            implementation. 8. Appropriate choice of indicators is a\n            must to measure developmental impact. Outputs should be\n            differentiated from outcomes and these should be measurable.\n            9. Apart from the above, there are sector/component specific\n            lessons in design and implementation for future education,\n            health, nutrition, roads and irrigation projects which have\n            been discussed in the component ICRs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Andhra Pradesh Economic\n            Restructuring Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Andhra Pradesh Economic\n            Restructuring Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2007/03/7581954/india-andhra-pradesh-economic-restructuring-project","projn":"IN-Ap Econ Restructuring -- P049385","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Primary Education,Population Policies,Transport Economics Policy & Planning","teratopic":"Education,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20070503115241"},"subsc":"Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance,Roads and highways,Primary education,Irrigation and drainage,Health","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Transport,Health, Nutrition and Population,Rural Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Transportation,Education,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access roads, access to primary education,\n            adolescent girls, aged, Agriculture, arterial roads, Baby,\n            capacity building, Child Development, Child Welfare,\n            Classrooms, communicable diseases, Community Health,\n            community participation, Cost Effectiveness, crops,\n            curriculum, decision making, development expenditure,\n            Development Objectives, Development Policy, DIET, DIETs,\n            disadvantaged groups, drainage, dropout, drugs, Early\n            Childhood, Early Childhood Education, economic growth,\n            empowerment, enrollment, enrollment rate, Family Health,\n            Family Welfare, finances, food security, head teachers,\n            health care services, Health Centers, Health Centres, Health\n            Education, Health Management, Health Sector, Health\n            Services, Health System, Health Workers, Highway, Highway\n            Project, highways, households, human development, incidence\n            of poverty, Information System, infrastructure development,\n            institutional capacity, intervention, interventions, iron,\n            learning, learning achievement, local community,\n            malnutrition, malnutrition among children, number of\n            children, Nutrition, nutrition components, O&amp;M,\n            Patient, Pediatrics, Performance Indicators, policy\n            framework, POVERTY REDUCTION, pre-school education, pregnant\n            women, Primary Education, Primary Education Project, primary\n            health care, primary health care system, primary school,\n            primary school access, primary schools, progress, public\n            expenditure, Quality Assurance, Quality Improvement, quality\n            of life, quality of services, referral system, Road, Road\n            Maintenance, Road Network, Roads, rural population, rural\n            roads, rural transport, school access, school children,\n            service quality, social development, social groups, social\n            sector, state highways, Supervision, sustainability, Teacher\n            Ratio, technical assistance, transport, transport planning,\n            unemployment, Vehicle, Vehicle Operating, Vehicle Operating\n            Costs, Waste, Woman, Workers"}},"owner":"Econ.
