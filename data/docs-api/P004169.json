Key lessons\n            reinforce the importance of strong ownership, particularly\n            by city governments, to ensure success, and sustainability\n            of a project. Therefore, extensive involvement of the water\n            agencies, and support from the city government in a\n            comprehensive wastewater strategy, would be instrumental for\n            making gains in this area. In addition, it has been proven\n            that financial covenants requiring a financial rate of\n            return of 2-3 percent for wastewater agencies, is\n            unrealistic under huge capital outlays over the short time.\n            It is suggested therefore, that financial objectives of\n            operations in the wastewater sector, should better focus on\n            promoting financial viability, such as internal cash\n            generation, and prudent financial management. Although\n            privatization of wastewater facilities in Kwangju was not\n            included in the project design, it was successfully\n            implemented, and thus, Seoul is considering pilot schemes\n            for one of its wastewater treatment plants. This shows that\n            opportunities for efficiency enhancement through private\n            participation exist, and should be considered early in\n            project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Korea -
