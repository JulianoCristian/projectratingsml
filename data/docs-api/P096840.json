As a result, growth\n            accelerated and public finances improved, with public debt\n            in 2006 at 48 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), down\n            from 78 percent. Poverty rates declined sharply. Yet,\n            sustained progress was threatened by challenges in reforming\n            public finances, and outdated regulations hindered\n            investments. Unemployment remained high, and the labor\n            market was largely unskilled. The sharp  deterioration in\n            the global economy in 2008 added to these challenges. The\n            first Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development\n            Policy Loan (REGE DPL 1) in 2010 streamlined World Bank\n            support to Turkey at a critical time when unemployment was\n            16 percent and GDP had contracted by 4.7 percent. The second\n            Restoring Equitable Growth and Employment Development Policy\n            Loan (REGE DPL 2) supports ongoing reforms of public\n            finances, commercial law, and civil procedures. Turkey has\n            reached almost universal health insurance coverage, enrolled\n            more children in pre-school, and dramatically increased\n            vocational training. These ongoing reforms are expected to\n            reduce poverty and inequality in Turkey over the long run."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sustaining growth with jobs and better\n            services in

Competitiveness and\n            Employment Loan (CEDPL 2) supports the advances in the\n            implementation of the government's competitiveness and\n            employment agenda since mid-2007. Turkey's future\n            competitiveness and employment agenda is expected to include\n            additional major reforms, such as: the passage of a new\n            Commercial Code, the completion of the second phase of the\n            labor market reforms, and the approval of a new capital\n            markets law. A possible follow-up CEDPL 3, the second in a\n            series of two programmatic operations, is envisaged to\n            support such future reforms. The government's\n            competitiveness and employment program is a central pillar\n            of Turkey's Ninth Development Plan, and the proposed\n            loan is a cornerstone of the 2008 Country Partnership\n            Strategy (CPS) which fully integrates the Bank's\n            activities for FY08-11 into the 9th Development Plan. The\n            program carries several risks. From the macroeconomic side,\n            given the global down-turn Turkey's continued reliance\n            on external finance creates significant risk. In particular,\n            a sudden capital outflow and disorderly depreciation would\n            have an adverse impact on growth and employment. Key to\n            mitigating this risk is government preparedness for\n            potential downside scenarios for the international financial\n            system and their impacts on Turkey. On the program side, all\n            CEDPL 2 supported reforms have been implemented, and the\n            risk of reversal is low. Among three key future reforms\n            expected to be supported by the planned CEDPL 3 (second\n            phase labor market reforms, the enactment of the new\n            Commercial Code, and the enactment of the new Capital Market\n            Law), the second-phase labor-market reform presents high\n            risks because of the intrinsic political economy challenges\n            of introducing regulation to make labor markets more flexible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Second Competitiveness and\n            Employment Development Policy Loan
