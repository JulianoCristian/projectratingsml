The\n            Government's Letter of Development Policy and its\n            accompanying matrix of policy actions outlines a program of\n            actions designed to achieve these targets. These actions\n            focus on trade and exchange rate policy, tax policies and\n            administration, specific private sector development\n            initiatives, public expenditure management, State-owned\n            enterprise reforms, and civil service reforms.
