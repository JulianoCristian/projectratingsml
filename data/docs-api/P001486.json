(BNI)'s performance was\n            generally satisfactory as a commercial financial\n            institution, but less so as a development institution. The\n            project's institution building objective of upgrading\n            BNI was only partially achieved, partly due to factors\n            exogenous to the financial institution such as adverse\n            macroeconomic conditions and considerable Government\n            interferences. Given the fact that the Government has a\n            majority equity participation, its actual influence on\n            crucial operational and institutional decision making was\n            significant which, however, blurred to a large extent of\n            BNI' s management functions and responsibilities. One\n            of the future key tasks, therefore, is to make BNI a more\n            independent, organizationally and financially autonomous\n            institution with clear objectives and responsibilities so\n            that it can play a more active and effective role in support\n            of Government's future industrial development strategy.\n            In essence, the experience with the first International\n            Development Association (IDA) financed line of credit to BNI\n            suggests that the operation was generally successful in\n            financing a number of priority Industrial and Small Scale\n            (SSE) subprojects. In operational decision making, and\n            partly us a result of continued weaknesses in BNI's\n            operational and financial management and organization."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Madagascar
