Lessons specific to this\n            operation suggest the project would have been better planned\n            as a standard investment loan, particularly since there was\n            no emergency at the time in Dominica, for it would have\n            enabled better preparation of procurement, and institutional\n            arrangements before appraisal.  Nonetheless, the\n            Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF) employing local\n            population in small-scale prevention works was successful in\n            Dominica, employing local populations, being a cost\n            effective way to reduce risks and raise community awareness.\n            However, the cost of works designed for Dominica was far out\n            of line with neighboring countries, which was the main\n            reason they could not be implemented under the project.\n            Lessons relevant to emergency operations suggest it would\n            have been preferable to process the various loans/credits\n            for OECS countries, as separate projects, part of a broader\n            program, but not integrated into one horizontal APL;\n            priority in this type of projects should be given to\n            prevention, immediate measures to reactivate economic\n            activity, and careful assessment of longer-term\n            reconstruction priorities and designs; and, careful\n            attention should be given to the project unit manpower,\n            particularly in the absence of local capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominica - Emergency Recovery and Disaster\n            Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominica - Emergency Recovery and\n            Disaster
