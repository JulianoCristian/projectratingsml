Lessons address the importance of\n            borrower ownership, and commitment, objectives which were\n            achieved successfully under this project, due to the\n            Tanzanian initiative, driven by national individuals with\n            strong personal incentives, committed to organizational\n            performance as the key to development progress. And, their\n            direction during appraisal, and implementation provided the\n            ingredients to develop strong ownership, in a less intrusive\n            policy agenda, allowing the Bank a more proactive role.\n            Despite the choice for a supply-driven approach to\n            organizational development, it was this approach which made\n            significant contributions in strengthening implementing\n            organizations, particularly on financial aspects. Moreover,\n            the dynamic drive to modernization, based on Tanzanian\n            roots, - and independent of the project - appears to have\n            energized the process into which the project evolved. The\n            progress of this project provides useful insights,\n            particularly when uncertainty conditions prevail, for\n            although the unconventional approach given to implementing\n            organizations came first, it allowed the broader strategic\n            issues, be sorted at an appropriate pace, where analysis had\n            to be combined with consensus building, complex learning,\n            and legitimization.
