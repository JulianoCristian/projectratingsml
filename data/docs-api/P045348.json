Lessons\n            suggest what follows. Substantial increases in yields and\n            livestock productivity can be achieved with an effective\n            extension management system, if linked with adaptive\n            agricultural research, and modified to the conditions in a\n            particular country. However, whatever system is used to\n            support producers, adequate mobility for the extension and\n            research staff is a precondition for obtaining results that\n            are broadly based on the rural population. Adding a\n            provision of funds for productive equipment, and\n            infrastructure can improve the motivation to produce more,\n            achieve more marketable produce, and strengthen the spirit\n            of collaboration and willingness of establishing\n            associations. By adding a subcomponent for such investments\n            at midterm, was an important project improvement, yet, not\n            totally enough. Successful rural development is a complex\n            task that requires support to \"upstream and downstream\n            activities\" linked to agricultural production. To\n            overcome this constraint, the supervision missions were\n            jointly organized with all donors concerned, for proper\n            coordination of project implementation. Other lessons\n            address limited resources and a gradual approach to\n            development; capacity building for nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs) and private sector operators;\n            understanding the preparatory needs for implementing\n            innovations; and, the appropriate Government coordination of\n            donor assistance in the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -

economy of Cameroon. The Agricultural Extension\n            & Research Program Support Project was created to\n            increase the agricultural production of small-scale farmers,\n            to initiate agricultural extension services that would be\n            respective of specific provincial environments, and to\n            finance education in order to produce more agricultural\n            extension specialists. The project was also designed to\n            strengthen the links between research and agricultural\n            extension services. This environmental assessment lists\n            these environmental risks: (i) increased toxins through the\n            improper use of chemical products, namely non-organic\n            pesticides and fertilizers; (ii) water pollution caused by\n            the improper use of such chemical products; (iii)\n            atmospheric pollution caused by fires on land set aside for\n            agricultural use; (iv) nutritional negligence caused by\n            farmers selling all of their produce and not reserving\n            sufficient amounts to address nutritional needs; (v)\n            deforestation caused by expansion of farm lands into forest\n            areas; and (vi) threats to biodiversity through the use of\n            pesticides. It is hope that these risks will be mitigated\n            through education on the use of pesticides and fertilizers,\n            the engendering of respect for the environment, and the need\n            to create food reserve for small-scale farmers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
