An amount of US$88\n            million was cancelled at the request of the government\n            before significant implementation of the project could be\n            initiated. Due to extensive negotiations with the government\n            over the Country Assistance Strategy, the project was\n            delayed. The government made an internal decision in early\n            1999 to finance the activities of the National Y2K project\n            team outside of the World Bank project. Given the nature of\n            the project and the precise timing that was required for\n            implementation, the delay in project processing ultimately\n            affected the

country's social and economic infrastructure that\n            will be caused by the failure of critical central, state,\n            and local government systems to process dates after December\n            31, 1999; and b) coordinate Y2K efforts in key sectors,\n            monitor closely the evolving overall national situation, and\n            prepare measures to deal with possible disruptions. There\n            are two primary components: 1) Public sector Y2K efforts\n            will address the Y2K problems of many agencies which have\n            large computerized applications that are at risk. Since many\n            of the applications were developed in-house, the remedial\n            efforts will similarly be done that way. Many at-risk items\n            require the procurement of upgrades or replacements. Goods\n            will therefore form the bulk of the intended expenditure\n            under this component. 2) National coordination efforts will\n            cover the coordination of contingency planning, critical\n            services with cross dependencies, national monitoring,\n            dissemination efforts, public information management, legal\n            planning,
