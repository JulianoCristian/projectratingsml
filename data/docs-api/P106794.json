The project shall allow for the\n            installation of 55,000 household connections in urban areas\n            countrywide over 4 years, equivalent to a 25 percent\n            increase in the total number of water connections in the\n            country. An estimated population of 330,000 people shall\n            gain access to safe piped water. For a typical household\n            connection, the connection cost amounts to US$ 198, plus US$\n            53 as an initial guarantee deposit, giving a total of US$\n            251 to be paid upfront by a new customer. This clearly is\n            not affordable to most urban households, where average\n            monthly income is US$ 31 for the first income quintile\n            increasing to US$ 68 for the third quintile. As a\n            consequence, the households currently connected to the piped\n            water network mostly belong to the fourth and fifth income\n            quintiles. This connection subsidy project will be\n            implemented as part of an urban and water development\n            support International Development Association (IDA) loan,\n            whose component three includes an amount of US$ 33 million\n            from IDA to support the implementation of the public-private\n            partnership between Cam water and the international private\n            operator. The proposed connection subsidy program was\n            explicitly included and analyzed as part of component three\n            of the IDA operation, as it is an integral part of the lease\n            contract. Financial management, procurement and safeguards\n            policies issues were analyzed during the IDA loan\n            preparation, and mitigation measures carried out under the\n            implementation of the Bank loan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon -
