Some lessons learned included:\n            other states in Brazil had implemented accelerated classes\n            targeting overage students with successful results in terms\n            of reducing age-grade distortion caused by high repetition\n            rates and late entrance. Now, the preliminary results of the\n            Accelerated Classes Program implemented under the project\n            provide further evidence, albeit preliminary, to support\n            these programs. Results show a decrease in age-grade\n            distortion in the early years of fundamental education from\n            56 percent in 2004 to 51.4 percent in 2006, and in secondary\n            education from 71.6 percent in 2004 to 69.7 percent in 2006.\n            The project's heavy reliance on a sizable Project\n            Coordination Unit (PCU), largely de-linked from the rest of\n            SEE (Secretaria de Educacao e Cultura - Secretariat of\n            Education and Culture) and operating to a certain extent\n            outside the framework of the Secretariat, is inadequate for\n            building institutional capacity in its main directorates,\n            and this is especially important for a project that has a\n            public sector management objective. While recognizing the\n            difficulties of selecting data sources for project level\n            indicators for monitoring progress, especially in areas such\n            as student learning achievement, the use of state- and\n            municipal-level indicators makes it difficult to measure the\n            results that are attributable directly to project-financed interventions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Pernambuco Integrated Development :\n            Education Quality Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Pernambuco

The project has\n            the following four components: 1) This component seeks to\n            improve the quality and efficiency of the 1,086 state\n            schools in Pernambuco. 2) This component aims to improve\n            education policy for the entire system and to support\n            programs targeted to areas of special concern such as less\n            than satisfactory teaching performance, high repetition\n            rates, large age-grade distortions, the need to consolidate\n            a culture of evaluation, and the exclusion of children with\n            disabilities in the education system. 3) This component\n            promotes the State reforms aimed at improving efficiency in\n            delivering public services through two subcomponents, one\n            that addresses broader public sector issues such as\n            supporting the development of public administration models\n            and procedures according to the master plan for the sate\n            reform (PDRE), and a second subcomponent that focuses on the\n            introduction of the more efficient models and procedures\n            into the education sector. 4) This component will finance\n            the management of the project and, at the same time support\n            the strengthening of State Education and Cultural\n            Secretariat (SEDUC) through the provision of technical\n            assistance and consultant services to implement the project\n            and to adapt SEDUC to better integrate and gradually absorb\n            project functions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
