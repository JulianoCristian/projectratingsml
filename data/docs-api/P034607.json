The overall\n            performances of the Bank and the Borrower are considered\n            satisfactory. Some of the lessons learned from this project\n            include the following: 1) The project effectively reflected\n            the Borrower's own priorities, which was key in\n            ensuring the continuous support of the Government, even in\n            the face of great challenges such as the devastation brought\n            by Hurricane Mitch. 2) The use of multiple instruments,\n            --lending and non-lending--, to support Bank intervention\n            maximized the Bank's effectiveness. Exhaustive sector\n            work provided a thorough diagnosis of the key challenges\n            facing the public sector. Similarly, having a PPF\n            facilitated project preparation and contributed greatly to\n            the project's quality at entry. 3) There are important\n            complementarities between structural adjustment and\n            technical assistance operations. The effectiveness of the\n            Private Sector modernization Structural Adjustment Credit\n            (PSMSAC) was greatly enhanced by having a companion\n            technical assistance loan, which focused on laying the\n            groundwork for the policy actions pursued under the PSMSAC.\n            Conversely, those sub-components not included in the\n            adjustment operation received significantly less attention\n            from the Government, stressing the importance of incentives\n            offered by structural adjustment operations. Given the\n            complexity of the project, it may have been better to\n            include only subcomponents directly related to the PSMTAC."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Honduras - Public Sector
