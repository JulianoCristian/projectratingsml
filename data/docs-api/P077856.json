The restructured project reflects the request from\n            the Government of India (GoI) to remove activities that are\n            covered by four contracts from the project description as\n            well as include follow-up activities to the LMNHP action\n            plan agreed between the Bank and NHAI in December 2008 (and,\n            modified in January 2009) to address the unsatisfactory\n            implementation performance of the project. The action plan\n            included actions to improve progress on five poorly\n            performing civil works contracts, construction safety,\n            contractor and consultant performance, fiduciary controls,\n            and also initiated a number of institutional development\n            measures to support NHAI in strengthening program\n            implementation. Implementation of the action plan has\n            generally been satisfactory with the exception of progress\n            on four of the five poorly performing works contracts. The\n            original action plan and its implementation status as on\n            March 2010 is attached as annex five. The revised action\n            plan (annex six) presents and incorporates those actions,\n            arising out of the present restructuring, primarily focusing\n            on safety aspects and
