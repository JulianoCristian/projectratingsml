Some of the key lessons learned\n            from two projects include: (i) where projects seek\n            improvements in incomes and living conditions of the poor, a\n            multidimensional approach will help to better define\n            objectives and monitor achievements;

Some lessons learned included:\n            targeting of the poorest goes well beyond the technical,\n            data-based definition of where the poorest groups are\n            located based on poverty indices and differentiated\n            allocation of resources. An operational strategy is needed\n            to reach them through mobilization and organization which\n            enables them to access the project on a more equal footing\n            from the outset. Systematic consultation and information\n            dissemination should be initiated well before project\n            effectiveness. The project showed that decentralized\n            integration of development programs and policies\n            transparently and cost-effectively through the Municipal\n            Council mechanism is one of several potential approaches to\n            leveraging additional resources and expertise for a\n            poverty-targeted population. Small scale productive\n            ventures, grant-financed, require a business plan, technical\n            and financial analysis, up-front marketing arrangements and\n            formal training for the operational phase exactly as with\n            larger ventures. Training and technical assistance for\n            productive subprojects are crucial inputs. Beneficiaries\n            need to get it right the first time under a one-time grant\n            financing opportunity to jump-start employment and income\n            generation, in addition to
