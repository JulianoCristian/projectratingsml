Economic Governance Reform\n            Operation (EGRO II) is the second in a series of development\n            policy operations to support the implementation of\n            Haiti's economic governance reform program, as spelled\n            out in the interim poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP)\n            and the recently prepared full PRSP, the Document de\n            Strate'gie Nationale pour la Croissance et la\n            Re'duction de la Pauvrete' (DSNCRP). The DSNCRP\n            emphasizes sustained, rapid growth as the main vehicle for\n            poverty reduction and is based on three pillars: (i)\n            accelerating growth and maintaining macroeconomic stability;\n            (ii) enhancing human development, with a focus on the\n            strengthening of social sectors to improve the delivery of\n            basic social services; and (iii) strengthening democratic\n            and economic governance, particularly through improving\n            justice and public security. The overall intention of the\n            Bank will be to open a window of opportunity to: (i) deepen\n            and extend the social assistance network; (ii) target\n            subsidies; (iii) elicit an income-enhancing supply response\n            among farmers (especially poor ones); (iv) start a dialogue\n            for better coordinated action across the island\n            (Haiti-Dominican Republic); and (v) design and implement\n            insurance mechanisms that could hedge the country against a\n            protracted and/or repeated episode of food inflation. In\n            addition, the Bank will also contribute to the\n            Government's efforts to address the crisis by extending\n            the school feeding program underway through the education\n            for all projects. The program will be adapted to cover some\n            children over the summer break and to expand coverage of the\n            program in the new school year starting September 2008.\n            Since EGRO II was approved, economic performance has been\n            good. Real gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated to\n            have risen by 3.2 percent in FY2007 (October-September),\n            more than one percentage point greater than in FY2005 (1.8\n            percent) helped by macroeconomic stability and international\n            economic assistance. Growth was driven by private\n            consumption, which benefited from the more stable\n            environment and strong remittances. Public investment also\n            contributed to growth."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Haiti - Second Economic Governance Reform\n            Operation (EGRO II) Development Policy
