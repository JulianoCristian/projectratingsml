Upon Empresa Electrica de Guatemala,\n            S.A.(EEGSA's), the Borrower's, and the\n            Guarantor's request, the portion of the loan that was\n            to be re-lent to EEGSA was canceled effective November 16,\n            1990, while the portion assigned to Instituto Nacional de\n            Electrificacion  (INDE) was canceled effective December 1,\n            1993.The primary reason for canceling EEGSA's portion\n            was the claim that, in view of the impossibility to disburse\n            funds from the loan, they had financed with their own\n            resources all the works that had initially been included in\n            the project. The lessons learned from this project were: The\n            main risks identified in the staff appraisal report (SAR)\n            were EEGSA's inexperience with Bank loans and\n            procedures and INDE's lack of experience in the\n            construction of an energy control center. In retrospect,\n            this experience highlights the need to ensure sufficient\n            political support for a proposed operation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guatemala - Power Distribution Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guatemala -
