Project objectives aimed at reinforcing\n            basic health services, and, strengthening emergency and\n            referral services, were not fully implemented. However,\n            activities such as health financing, and, management\n            autonomy for larger number of hospitals, though achieved\n            only towards the end of the project, predict a positive\n            long-term impact on sector development. Regardless of the\n            negative outcome, the project did play an important role as\n            a catalyst in the overall sector development, and\n            contributed to launching sector reforms. The lessons learned\n            show that a gradual approach is key to the reform process,\n            and successful realistic projects, attain limited numbers of\n            priority activities. The provision of adequate support to\n            priority public health programs is essential, allowing\n            governments to allocate further public resources to these\n            programs. The integration of investment projects within a\n            well structured development strategy, allows clear targets\n            to achieve essential health services. It is also emphasized,\n            that the involvement of stakeholders, in project\n            implementation, further ensures consensus, and coordination\n            on health financing strategies. Finally, it is suggested\n            that monitoring and evaluation indicators, at an early\n            start, are relevant, as is the continuity of Bank's supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Health Sector Investment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Health Sector\n            Investment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/06/728319/morocco-health-sector-investment-project","projn":"MA-Health Sector Invest -- P005440","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_99070105313441"},"subsc":"Health","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic health care,basic health\n            services,community health,decentralization,development\n            projects,dispensaries,districts,economic\n            efficiency,emergency medicine,essential\n            drugs,extension,family planning,financial management,Health\n            care,health care services,health centers,health\n            conditions,health facilities,Health Financing,health\n            insurance,health needs,health programs,Health Sector,health\n            services,health status,health system,health workers,hospital\n            emergency services,hospital management,hospital\n            services,hospitals,human resource\n            management,hygiene,illiteracy,immunization,income,infectious\n            diseases,insurance systems,integrated health\n            care,leprosy,malaria,managers,medical\n            equipment,mortality,motivation,population groups,poverty\n            alleviation,primary care,primary health care,private\n            sector,Public Health,rehabilitation,rural areas,rural\n            hospitals,screening,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,STDs,urban\n            areas,vaccination,water supply,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"basic health care,basic health\n            services,community health,decentralization,development\n            projects,dispensaries,districts,economic\n            efficiency,emergency medicine,essential\n            drugs,extension,family planning,financial management,Health\n            care,health care services,health centers,health\n            conditions,health facilities,Health Financing,health\n            insurance,health needs,health programs,Health Sector,health\n            services,health status,health system,health workers,hospital\n            emergency services,hospital management,hospital\n            services,hospitals,human resource\n            management,hygiene,illiteracy,immunization,income,infectious\n            diseases,insurance systems,integrated health\n            care,leprosy,malaria,managers,medical\n            equipment,mortality,motivation,population groups,poverty\n            alleviation,primary care,primary health care,private\n            sector,Public Health,rehabilitation,rural areas,rural\n            hospitals,screening,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,STDs,urban\n            areas,vaccination,water supply,workers"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.

The proposed project\n            would build on pilot-scale efforts financed by the Health\n            Development Project which has helped establish sound\n            standards and flexible institutional arrangements for the\n            delivery of primary health care. It is designed to\n            rehabilitate essential basic health services using existing\n            infrastructure. It would provide the resources required to\n            reinforce priority health programs in primary care and at\n            the first level of referral; strengthen the administration\n            and management of health services; and the maintenance of\n            buildings and biomedical equipment. It would also support\n            ongoing Ministry of Health (MOH) efforts to test and\n            implement various improvements in service quality and\n            efficiency; increase cost recovery for curative care;\n            facilitate the mobilization of additional resources in\n            support of the sector; and streamline arrangements for\n            services financed by public and private sector insurance funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Health Sector Investment Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Health Sector\n            Investment
