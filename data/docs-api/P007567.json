The overall outcome of the project was\n            satisfactory; the performance of the Bank and the borrower\n            is rated satisfactory. In May 1980, Government issued a\n            policy paper on PIDER re-focusing program objectives to: a)\n            promote a self-sustained development process within rural\n            communities and b) guarantee access to goods and services\n            which provide adequate living standards. The third PIDER\n            objective was to increase the development impact of the\n            existing program by supporting Government's efforts to\n            expand and intensify activities in seventeen selected\n            micro-regions (MRs) located in the states of Guerrero,\n            Sinaloa, Yucatan, and Zacatecas. The project became\n            effective May 1982, the year of two devaluations and\n            economic deterioration of crisis proportion. Start-up\n            activities were delayed due to insufficient counterpart\n            funds and a change in political administration which\n            instituted reorganization, a freeze on hiring and\n            considerable staff movements at various levels of\n            Government. The third PIDER provides lessons for improvement\n            for both the Borrower and the Bank. They are to: (a) devise\n            measures which allow programs to transcend institutional\n            discontinuities, (b) require in-depth evaluations as a\n            pre-condition to making fundamental changes in project\n            design, (c) return to programming investments, at every\n            administrative level, with a more long-term perspective so\n            that prospective actions in related program areas can be\n            more appropriately integrated; and (d) apply more thoroughly\n            economic, financial, and technical appraisal criteria for\n            sub-project investments and ensure adherence."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mexico -
