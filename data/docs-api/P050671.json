Some lessons learned included: projects can be\n            successfully implemented when there is a strong stakeholder\n            commitment to reform, and when there is strong political and\n            administrative commitment to monitor progress and make\n            flexible changes as required. Clear leadership, willingness\n            to implement reforms at a senior level, and a broad\n            consensus on priorities facilitated project implementation\n            during much of the project period. This lesson is noteworthy\n            as the project was implemented against a backdrop of\n            political upheaval and physical insecurity. One of the major\n            sectoral lessons learnt is that the private sector could\n            play a major role in the telecommunications sector; even in\n            challenging political and security environment. This is\n            evident in the highly successful rural access component of\n            this project, which succeeded beyond expectations in spite\n            of internal and external skepticism. With hindsight, the\n            private sector brought services to all the targeted\n            beneficiaries in the Village Development Committee (VDCs)\n            when the government could not. Its success also brought\n            significant benefits on the side - the operator itself\n            invested about USD 40 million, competition was brought to\n            the market, the regulator was forced to look at\n            interconnection issues, and the government gained confidence\n            to offer additional rural licenses without any capital\n            subsidy. Even in mountainous countries like Nepal, a\n            competitive market environment promotes enhanced service\n            coverage, quality and leads to competitive tariffs and\n            services for consumers. The entry of new operators in Nepal,\n            especially the second mobile operator, led to the\n            accelerated expansion of service and reduced tariffs even in\n            areas with challenging terrain."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Telecommunications Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Telecommunications Sector\n            Reform
