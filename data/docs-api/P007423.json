Credits\n            will be made available under the project to larger SSEs\n            (enterprises with net fixed assets of up to US$100,000,\n            excluding real property) through the commercial banking\n            system and to the very small SSEs (enterprises with net\n            fixed assets of up to US$20,000 excluding real property)\n            through a new institution, the Small Enterprise Development\n            Corporation (SEDCO), designed to serve such enterprises. It\n            is anticipated that the project would provide about 100\n            credits to large SSEs, averaging about US$69,000 each and\n            about 300 credits to very small SSEs, averaging about\n            US$13,000 each."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Small-scale Enterprise Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Small-scale Enterprise\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/06/726876/jamaica-small-scale-enterprise-development-project","projn":"JM-Small Scale Enterpri-270652 -- P007423","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism,Financial Intermediation","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Jamaica","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912384359"},"subsc":"(Historic)Financial sector development","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            procedures,administrative\n            costs,affiliates,agriculture,annual\n            sales,assets,Autonomy,balance of payments,bank branches,bank\n            lending,Bank Loans,Bank of Jamaica,banking system,capacity\n            utilization,capital goods,central bank,chemical\n            fertilizers,Commercial Banks,commercial credit,comparative\n            advantage,comparative advantages,competitiveness,credit\n            unions,current prices,decentralization,Demand\n            Deposits,deposits,depreciation\n            allowances,devaluation,development banking,development\n            strategy,economic problems,economic sectors,economies of\n            scale,employment,exchange rate,Exports,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediation,FINANCIAL\n            SECTOR,Fiscal Policy,FISCAL YEAR,fixed assets,fixed\n            capital,foreign banks,foreign competition,Foreign\n            Exchange,GDP,gross revenue,gross sales,gross\n            value,housing,imports,income,income\n            groups,Insurance,Interest Rate,Interest Rates,intermediate\n            goods,labor force,land development,laws,lending\n            rates,liquidity,loan supervision,marginal costs,merchant\n            banks,mixed economy,mortgage banks,natural resources,NET\n            INTEREST MARGIN,onlending,operating\n            costs,portfolio,producers,productivity,refrigeration,resource\n            mobilization,savings,savings deposits,Small\n            Business,subsidiary,taxation,TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE,time\n            deposits,trusts,unemployment,value added,value of\n            output,Venture Capital,wages,Working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            procedures,administrative\n            costs,affiliates,agriculture,annual\n            sales,assets,Autonomy,balance of payments,bank branches,bank\n            lending,Bank Loans,Bank of Jamaica,banking system,capacity\n            utilization,capital goods,central bank,chemical\n            fertilizers,Commercial Banks,commercial credit,comparative\n            advantage,comparative advantages,competitiveness,credit\n            unions,current prices,decentralization,Demand\n            Deposits,deposits,depreciation\n            allowances,devaluation,development banking,development\n            strategy,economic problems,economic sectors,economies of\n            scale,employment,exchange rate,Exports,financial\n            institutions,financial intermediation,FINANCIAL\n            SECTOR,Fiscal Policy,FISCAL YEAR,fixed assets,fixed\n            capital,foreign banks,foreign competition,Foreign\n            Exchange,GDP,gross revenue,gross sales,gross\n            value,housing,imports,income,income\n            groups,Insurance,Interest Rate,Interest Rates,intermediate\n            goods,labor force,land development,laws,lending\n            rates,liquidity,loan supervision,marginal costs,merchant\n            banks,mixed economy,mortgage banks,natural resources,NET\n            INTEREST MARGIN,onlending,operating\n            costs,portfolio,producers,productivity,refrigeration,resource\n            mobilization,savings,savings deposits,Small\n            Business,subsidiary,taxation,TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE,time\n            deposits,trusts,unemployment,value added,value of\n            output,Venture Capital,wages,Working capital"}},"owner":"Caribbean Countries CMU (LCC3C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"1951"},"facets":{}}}
