The key lessons learned\n            include: a) The Paralimni Sewerage Board and the Ayia Napa\n            Sewerage Board faced difficulties in handling promptly the\n            issues that needed the joint decision of the two boards.\n            During the project preparation, the joint venture approach\n            should have been subject to a more thorough review taking\n            into account not only the economic and financial\n            implications, but also the legal, social, and political\n            aspects and engineering issues. b) The turnkey bidding\n            approach is sometimes favored by the employer because they\n            do not need to carry out the detailed design before issuing\n            the invitation bid. However the total amount of time\n            required for completing the whole bidding process should be\n            considered. Also, a technical alternative should have been\n            considered only for the lowest evaluated bidder of the base\n            bid. c) The appraisal projections for sewer rate structure\n            and the revenues proved to be overly optimistic. d) The\n            assessment of willingness-to-pay during appraisal was not\n            adequate. e) The scope of the project should haven been\n            defined in a more participatory manner to gain support from\n            the local authorities and central government, as well as\n            from the general public."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cyprus -
