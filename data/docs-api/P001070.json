Lessons underline what\n            can be achieved through commitment and focus, in a low\n            resource environment, and with limitations in highly skilled\n            personnel. The Government commitment was evident in the\n            policy actions, and changes in management in the Ministry of\n            Public Health and Social Affairs, and in the delivery\n            objectives that improved health. However, while\n            sustainability is likely, renewed donor commitment will be\n            required for the long-term; and, household surveys need to\n            be conducted to ensure continued access to services. Most\n            importantly, Guinea has shown the potential to manage\n            complex health programs, which with the strong project unit\n            support, and strengthened regional administration proved\n            satisfactory. Nonetheless, issues in project design\n            presented initial difficulties, particularly in iodine\n            interventions, an issue that requires more critical\n            technical oversight at appraisal. The successful financial\n            management and local contracting, is an experience that\n            should be built on, to determine the potential local ability\n            to undertake larger projects. However this is a challenge\n            that translates sustaining the health facility structures,\n            into actual services, and improved health care delivery,\n            requiring further Government, and stakeholder commitments,\n            as well as escalating the utilization level of health\n            services to the rural poor, and linking traditional healers\n            with the formal system. It is important that Government\n            consider policies for private sector participation in the\n            health sector, and, for exploiting opportunities for\n            inter-sectoral collaboration, by addressing health issues,\n            where community poverty alleviation programs could be\n            designed, and mainstreamed into the different infrastructure\n            sector projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Health and Nutrition Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Health and Nutrition\n            Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/10/2030336/guinea-health-nutrition-sector-project","projn":"GN-Health/Nutrition Sector Project -- P001070","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02101704145469"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aging,basic health services,communicable\n            diseases,Communities,community\n            participation,deaths,decentralization,decision\n            making,Development Goals,Disease\n            Control,districts,doctors,economic\n            growth,equipment,essential drugs,extension,Family\n            Planning,Financial Management,Health Care,health\n            centers,health committees,health education,Health\n            Facilities,health indicators,health institutions,Health\n            ministries,health outcomes,health policy,health\n            programs,health promotion,health reform,health sector,health\n            services,health status,health system,hospital\n            management,hospitals,human resource\n            management,immunization,Incomes,institutionalization,intervention,malaria,malnutrition,managers,medicines,meningitis,mortality,motivation,nurses,Nutrition,patients,Pharmacy,poverty\n            alleviation,Pregnancy,primary care,primary health\n            care,private sector,Professional associations,Public\n            Health,public sector,Radio,rehabilitation,supervision,Sustainability,Transport,villages,workers"},"1":{"cdata!":"aging,basic health services,communicable\n            diseases,Communities,community\n            participation,deaths,decentralization,decision\n            making,Development Goals,Disease\n            Control,districts,doctors,economic\n            growth,equipment,essential drugs,extension,Family\n            Planning,Financial Management,Health Care,health\n            centers,health committees,health education,Health\n            Facilities,health indicators,health institutions,Health\n            ministries,health outcomes,health policy,health\n            programs,health promotion,health reform,health sector,health\n            services,health status,health system,hospital\n            management,hospitals,human resource\n            management,immunization,Incomes,institutionalization,intervention,malaria,malnutrition,managers,medicines,meningitis,mortality,motivation,nurses,Nutrition,patients,Pharmacy,poverty\n            alleviation,Pregnancy,primary care,primary health\n            care,private sector,Professional associations,Public\n            Health,public sector,Radio,rehabilitation,supervision,Sustainability,Transport,villages,workers"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF021070-SWEDISH (SIDA) CONSULTANTS\n            TRUST FUND,TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF036279-GUINEA - HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT,TF035511-GUINEA - HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT,TF032893-GUINEA - HEALTH,TF032808-GUINEA - HEALTH,TF022405-REG.
