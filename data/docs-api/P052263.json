Lessons for\n            project preparation indicate that components which cannot be\n            prepared fully, should not be included in a project, or at\n            the very least, should be considered highly risky, with\n            mitigation measures put into place; that broader political\n            support is paramount in a country with such high political\n            tensions, and where political fortunes are made, and lost\n            quite fast. Hence, depending on a particular champion the\n            project becomes much riskier; that participatory approaches\n            involving all stakeholders from the beginning helps enhance\n            ownership, providing a chance of well-implemented\n            micro-projects; that it is important for learning and\n            innovation loans to ensure measurable indicators early on,\n            including a monitoring and evaluation system, and that staff\n            are trained in data collection procedures. Lessons for\n            project implementation stipulate that the Bank should not\n            precede government's efforts in the area of\n            decentralization because as in this case, the government did\n            not fully exercise its oversight responsibility, rather led\n            to tensions between the implementing agencies, and the\n            government central institutions. And other lessons suggest\n            that the inclusion of maintenance plans in micro-project\n            proposals as a requirement, contributes to sustainability of\n            the structures; that capacity building should be considered\n            part of individual micro-projects, to strengthen beneficiary\n            communities in project planning, and

The project includes four\n            components. 1) The first component will finance small\n            socio-economic infrastructure, through the rehabilitation\n            and extension of elementary schools and health centers, to\n            include installation of water points and/or construction of\n            latrines, etc. Repair of bridges, and community public\n            centers, such as markets, will also be considered under this\n            component. 2) The second component focuses on capacity\n            building, financing human capital investments for community\n            benefits, thus increasing functional literacy and providing\n            training for village health workers. It will also provide\n            beneficiaries with organizational , managerial and strategic\n            skills. 3) The third component will support financial\n            intermediation. Although the definition of this component\n            will become effective as the project progresses,\n            institutional building will promote income-generating\n            activities. 4) The fourth component will promote\n            institutional mechanisms for a system of decentralized\n            social funds, where project management and institutional\n            building will have control over operational expenditures\n            concerning implementation, supervision and coordination."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Pilot Social Fund
