One could argue that this\n            breadth proved unwieldy and made the job of the project unit\n            extremely difficult. It also resulted in delays because of\n            the large number of coordination agreements required. Each\n            change of government necessitated rebuilding relationships\n            and convincing new leadership of the Project's\n            validity. However, on the other hand, the involvement of a\n            large number of implementing agencies that felt that the\n            Project activities were useful meant that the Project had\n            solid and continuous support in the Government; and 2)\n            communication and community participation approach highly\n            beneficial. PROMEC's communication and participation\n            activities were considered by participants to be innovative,\n            important and highly beneficial. The benefits were multiple:\n            (a) helping create awareness of Project activities; (b)\n            building consensus on implementation approaches; (c)\n            building capacity of communities and individuals to\n            participate in design and implementation; and, perhaps most\n            importantly, (d) increasing accountability and transparency\n            of the Project's activities and management to\n            stakeholders. All of these factors contributed to the\n            generally positive perception of the Project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador - Power and Communication Sectors\n            Modernization and Rural

Project aims at deepening\n            reforms in the telecommunications, and electricity sectors,\n            by strengthening regulatory institutions, and improving\n            environmental management of the sectors' activities,\n            fostering competition, and increasing private participation,\n            promoting efficient use of energy, and providing new\n            information and communication technologies (IT) to support\n            services to micro, and small businesses. The components\n            will: 1) strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks in\n            telecommunications, and electricity. Public consultations,\n            and dissemination of regulatory decisions will be undertaken\n            to supervise, and strengthen the Telecommunications Agency\n            (SUPTEL), while software programs, and equipment will be\n            financed, and a telecommunications tariff rebalancing plan\n            prepared. Electricity regulations of the National Council of\n            Electricity will be completed, including strengthening its\n            institutional capacity, and monitoring criteria, and that of\n            other sector institutions. Selected energy, and tariff\n            studies will support these activities; 2) extend services to\n            low income groups, and small businesses in peri-urban areas,\n            by developing pilot projects, an electrification strategy\n            (both grid-extension and off-grid), revising IT regulations,\n            and, developing IT access in marginal urban, and rural\n            areas; 3) design, and implement a program to promote the\n            use, and conservation of electricity, to include tariff\n            incentives, standards for efficient electrical appliances,\n            public information, and, market assessment, and training to\n            local energy service companies; and, 4) finance project\n            management, consultation, and

the Ecuador Power and Communications Sectors\n            Modernization and Rural Services Project anticipates likely\n            negative environmental impacts and proposes measures to\n            mitigate them. This report also analyzes the effectiveness\n            of the environmental legislation for the energy and\n            telecommunications sectors related to the project\n            components, and discusses ways to strengthen policies and\n            the institutional capacity for environmental management.\n            Major impacts due to the internal combustion associated with\n            thermoelectric generation are emissions of nitrous oxide and\n            monoxide. Other potential impacts are significant water\n            pollution, leakage of hydrocarbons, inadequate solid waste\n            disposal, and noise affecting workers as well as neighboring\n            populations. Potential impacts associated with hydroelectric\n            generation include the deterioration in quantity of water\n            resources, that is interrupted water flow, reduced water\n            availability and regularity for use by the general\n            population; a deterioration in water quality because of the\n            excessive production of nutrients leading to anaerobic\n            conditions., loss of the vegetal cover and acceleration of\n            erosion caused by reservoirs and civil works, and increased\n            noise and vibrations caused by machinery and equipment which\n            would not only affect neighboring populations but the also\n            the health of workers. Recommended mitigation measures to\n            offset these impacts include devising policies to reduce\n            emissions--in particular adhering to provisions of the Kyoto\n            Accord, and relying on domestic agencies concerned with\n            insuring environmentally sustainable development, as well as\n            promoting use of renewable energy resources. Negative\n            impacts likely to arise from energy transmission comprise\n            destruction of forest and biodiversity, and interference\n            with protected area management and fragile ecosystems\n            because of transmission lines and installations, as well as\n            reduced access to areas where theses structures are located,\n            increased solid waste generation, electromagnetic radiation\n            from transmission lines affecting humans and animal species,\n            and a reduced right-of-way."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ecuador -
