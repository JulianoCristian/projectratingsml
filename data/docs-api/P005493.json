However, the project was\n            successful in moving the agricultural policy agenda forward.\n            The Bank failed to deliver appropriate preparation and\n            supervision of the project, due to several staff changes,\n            making a sustained dialogue difficult. Conversely, the\n            performance of the borrower was marginally satisfactory, in\n            that, policy reforms and project actions, \"owned'\n            by the borrower, were accomplished with diligence and\n            method. Regardless of the outcome, it is worth noting that\n            most of the reform program was implemented, thus providing a\n            positive impact for future rural sector development. The\n            lessons learned show that project objectives need to be\n            realistic, clearly defined, and above all, agreed upon with\n            the borrower. Sector or sub-sector investment operations\n            need a coherent focus on policy and institutional reforms,\n            with increased participation by the borrower in its\n            formulation. Systematic measures for development and impact\n            indicators, need to be in place, specifically, at the design\n            stage (mandatory in Bank projects since 1997). Procurement\n            practices, disbursement procedures and auditing, need to be\n            addressed early on, and explicitly agreed with the borrower.\n            Finally, a sustained

to\n            support a well-conceived investment program in\n            Morocco's agricultural sector. The ASIL II will finance\n            specific critical investments in: agricultural education,\n            livestock, crop production, plant protection, land policy\n            programs, rainfed land improvements, forestry, extension,\n            small- and medium- scale irrigation, and planning. The loan\n            will also finance an Agricultural Development Fund (FDA)\n            which promotes private investments in: land improvements;\n            irrigation improvements; increased use of small-scale farm\n            equipment; livestock intensification; phyto-sanitary\n            protection; and increased tree planting.
