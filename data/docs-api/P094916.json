Some\n            lessons learned included: although there is more to be done\n            and additional capacity building measures can have been\n            incorporated into the project, Manantali Energy Management\n            Company (SOGEM) has gained experience and know-how from the\n            implementation of the Felou HEP, including interactions with\n            large contractors, consultants, and donors. The highlight of\n            the Felou project implementation is the inordinate amount of\n            time taken on a two-stage bidding process to contract the\n            design-build contractor and the economic losses incurred as\n            a consequence. The existing state of play is a threat to the\n            development of Senegal River Basin Development Organization\n            (OMVS) and its three participating utilities but also to the\n            future of the West Africa power pool (WAPP). This regional\n            electric power arrangement cannot develop into a market\n            unless the electricity sellers have some assurance that they\n            will be paid. Most attempts to have the operation and\n            maintenance (O and M) responsibility borne by a separate\n            (often foreign) firm which has no long term interest in the\n            project\u2019s performance in term of reliability, safety,\n            durability, etc. have not been fully satisfying as the\n            Manantali experience has shown. This option will obviously\n            require providing a strong technical and organizational\n            support to this entity for some years, with the main\n            objective of increasing the company\u2019s own capacity to\n            eventually be able to operate largely in an autonomous\n            manner. Two financial covenants were imposed on SOGEM\n            requiring it to maintain a level of accounts receivable of\n            less than 90 days and to have net revenues to be at least\n            1.2 times the estimated maximum debt service requirements."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Africa - Felou Hydroelectric Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa - Felou Hydroelectric

supply to the national\n            power utilities of Mali (EDM), Mauritania (SOMELEC) and\n            Senegal (SENELEC) as a means to alleviate widening power\n            supply deficits that have resulted in chronic load shedding\n            in Senegal River Basin countries (Mali, Mauritania,\n            Senegal); and (b) develop the power system of the Senegal\n            River Basin Development Authority (OMVS) into a nucleus\n            power pooling mechanism that can be replicated for other\n            sub-regions of WAPP 'Zone B'. The project Engineer\n            is providing support to SOGEM for the recruitment of a\n            private operator for the Manantali and Felou hydropower and\n            transmission projects. The consulting services to prepare\n            the specifications of SOGEM's (Societe de Gestion de\n            l'Energie de Manantalinew) SCADA (Supervisory Control\n            and Data Acquisition) system are under recruitment (at\n            financial evaluation phase) and are expected to start in\n            September 2012. The contract for the supply and installation\n            of the SCADA system itself is expected to be signed in April\n            2012; the full financing of this contract would require an\n            extension of credit closing date by about 9 months, which\n            will be considered by the Bank in due time. The reallocation\n            is necessary to allow the full financing of the\n            project's components as stipulated envisaged in the\n            project's agreements and project appraisal report. This\n            requires a reallocation between categories of the three\n            credits that still have available funds, in order to reflect\n            the increase in estimated costs of the project's\n            component two (consulting services, due to minor increase in\n            the scope of services) and component three (consulting\n            services and SCADA equipment, due to a minor increase in\n            cost estimate)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Africa Region - Mali, Mauritania,\n            and Senegal Felou Second Hydroelectric (APL) Project :\n            restructuring  : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2012/08/16724098/africa-region-mali-mauritania-senegal-felou-second-hydroelectric-apl-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"3A-Wapp Apl 2 - Omvs Felou Hydroelectric\n            Project -- P094916","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Post Conflict Reconstruction,Housing & Human Habitats,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress,Debt Markets","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Africa","entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20120911233013"},"theme":"Regional integration,Water resource management,Trade facilitation and market access,Regulation and competition policy","subsc":"General public administration sector,Hydropower","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Conflict and Development,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Consulting Services, cost estimate, cost\n            sharing, CREDITS, disbursement, Engineer, Equipment,\n            Exchange rate, Expenditure, expenditures, extension of\n            credit, initial credits, International Development,\n            investment activities, Investment Bank, loan, modalities,\n            project appraisal, Project implementation, Project\n            management, Regional Integration, remedy, Resettlement"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 2 (AFTG2)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Adaptable Program Loan"}},"majtheme":"Trade and integration,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development","repnb":"71881"},"facets":{}}}
