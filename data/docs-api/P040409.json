The World\n            Bank's overall performance is judged satisfactory;\n            similarly, Borrower performance is rated satisfactory\n            overall. Lessons learned include the following: Emergency\n            lending requires a clear assessment of the essential\n            elements for successful implementation, and demonstrated\n            government commitment to these elements. In this project,\n            the Government agreed to hire an experienced international\n            contractor using sole source negotiations and to provide $12\n            million to initiate the contractor's work. On the\n            Bank's part, emergency lending requires 1) intensive\n            implementation supervision to keep the project on track; 2)\n            willingness to take risks where the prospects for success\n            are uncertain; and 3) a continuity of project managmeent,\n            especially from the field office. The closing date of an\n            emergency project should be extended when the purpose is to\n            complete project components that will greatly enhance the\n            sustainability of project benefits. In this case, extending\n            completion to ensure that the water separation unit was\n            completed was essential for achieving sustainability of the\n            long-term integrity of the oil pipeline. To keep survey\n            participants' expectations on level with project\n            funding capabilities, the PIU needs to set clear social\n            program priorities, and maintain regular and timely\n            communications with the affected population. Only minimum\n            attention was paid to the extensive harm that the previous\n            oil spill had done to local communities. The local\n            population, however, viewed the most recent damage to their\n            ecosystem in the context of a long history of environmental\n            assaults. A return to the status quo just prior to the most\n            recent environmental assault left a residue of grievances of\n            justice unfulfilled. To minimize this kind of problem, the\n            Bank might wish to include a project component directed at\n            ameliorating preexisting problems. If loan funds are\n            provided to organizations that are candidates for\n            restructuring, frequent management or ownership changes\n            (including privatization), are likely to cause delays in\n            project implementation. The Bank needs to consider ways for\n            the loan's legal documentation to include agreements on\n            ways that the Bank and the Government would respond to such events."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation -

In\n            excess of 100,000 tons (730,000 barrels) of oil are\n            estimated to be trapped in very difficult to access bogs and\n            creek beds, three times the amount released during the Exxon\n            Valdez spill. In autumn 1994 over 20,000 tons (140,000\n            barrels) of oil were released into the Kolva River when\n            temporary dikes built to contain the oil, failed during\n            heavy fall rains. Serious damages were caused to downstream\n            communities, in particular, Kolva village, as a result of\n            the releases. The Komi Republic emergency Situation\n            Commission on October 10, 1994 declared an emergency in the\n            Kolva River area. Wholesale release of the remaining oil\n            into the river would create an ecological disaster,\n            threatening the livelihood of the downstream communities\n            which depend on the river system and the overall environment\n            of the Pectora river system into which the Kolva and Usa\n            rivers flow. Immediate priority is completion of structures\n            to contain the oil to allow orderly removal and disposal of\n            gross oil. Construction of significant new structures is\n            also required in the very limited time remaining before\n            spring thaw. In addition to the significant containment and\n            cleanup efforts required, further serious spills are likely\n            from the pipeline if urgent rehabilitation investment are\n            not undertaken. Continuation of oil production and transport\n            is also important to provide fuel for the heating plant\n            serving the Usinsk region. The project is justified on the\n            basis of the severity of the present and potential\n            environmental disaster, as well as the need to continue oil\n            production in a sustainable way in the Komi region. In\n            addition, this emergency operation will provide a vehicle\n            for studying and introducing oil spill mitigation measures\n            in Russia's pipeline network."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation -

In\n            addition, this emergency operation will provide a vehicle\n            for studying and introducing oil spill mitigation measures\n            in Russia's pipeline network."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Emergency Oil Spill\n            Recovery and Mitigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Emergency\n            Oil Spill Recovery and Mitigation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/04/732717/russian-federation-emergency-oil-spill-recovery-mitigation-project","projn":"RU-Emergency Oil Spill Recovery &\n            Mitigation Project -- P040409","subtopic":"Economic Adjustment and Lending,Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Energy Demand","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970311121305"},"subsc":"Oil and gas,Other social services","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas,(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"amount of oil,barrels per day,beneficial\n            impact,BORROWER,capacity utilization,Capital\n            Markets,Commitment,commitments,contractors,Crude\n            Oil,debt,Disbursement,disbursements,ecological\n            damage,ecological disaster,emission,employment,Environmental\n            Aspects,Environmental Assessment,environmental\n            benefits,environmental cleanup,environmental\n            damage,environmental disaster,expenditures,financial\n            resources,fish,Fuel,Gas Production,grace period,health\n            problems,LOAN,loan amount,loan effectiveness,market\n            prices,maturity,MPC,Oil,Oil & Gas,oil and gas,oil\n            company,oil pipeline,Oil production,oil production\n            capacity,oil recovery,oil sector,oily\n            wastes,Petroleum,petroleum industry,Pipeline,pipeline\n            facilities,pipeline investment,pipeline network,pipeline\n            transport,pipelines,pollution,present value,production\n            capacity,Retroactive Financing,subsidiary,subsidiary loan agreement"},"1":{"cdata!":"amount of oil,barrels per day,beneficial\n            impact,BORROWER,capacity utilization,Capital\n            Markets,Commitment,commitments,contractors,Crude\n            Oil,debt,Disbursement,disbursements,ecological\n            damage,ecological disaster,emission,employment,Environmental\n            Aspects,Environmental Assessment,environmental\n            benefits,environmental cleanup,environmental\n            damage,environmental disaster,expenditures,financial\n            resources,fish,Fuel,Gas Production,grace period,health\n            problems,LOAN,loan amount,loan effectiveness,market\n            prices,maturity,MPC,Oil,Oil & Gas,oil and gas,oil\n            company,oil pipeline,Oil production,oil production\n            capacity,oil recovery,oil sector,oily\n            wastes,Petroleum,petroleum industry,Pipeline,pipeline\n            facilities,pipeline investment,pipeline network,pipeline\n            transport,pipelines,pollution,present value,production\n            capacity,Retroactive Financing,subsidiary,subsidiary loan agreement"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF023875-USAID-ENERGY/ENVIRONMENT STUDY\n            IN NIS,TF032219-RUSSIAN FEDERATION - ENVIRONMENT","repnb":"P6578"},"facets":{}}}
