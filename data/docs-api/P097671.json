Some\n            lessons learned included: the project team took the right\n            decision to shift to a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL)\n            focused on the core building blocks for the HSSP support for\n            one sector program; enhanced Development Partner (DP)\n            coordination; and joint monitoring and strengthening of\n            Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) budget and\n            planning systems. This perhaps took too long because of the\n            collective regional commitment to a Sector Wide Approach\n            (SWAp) without being clear on what the up-front readiness\n            conditions should be. Another lesson is that enhanced\n            supervision and implementation support is needed,\n            particularly in fiduciary management for projects, in\n            countries such as the Solomon Islands, no matter what the\n            scale of the project. Procurement and particularly financial\n            management support from specialized staff in the Bank was\n            inadequate and typically not coordinated with review\n            missions. The separation of team responsibilities within the\n            Bank for different parts of the supervision process in the\n            recent past has reduced the effectiveness of the Bank in\n            supervision of projects. A key lesson is that the Bank needs\n            to develop a better business model for undertaking fiduciary\n            supervision in small countries where it cannot justify\n            locating fiduciary specialists in-country. Another lesson is\n            that persistence on the need for core Bank requirements\n            sometimes pays off. The executing agency often complained\n            strongly about the Bank's insistence, under the\n            project, to develop a procurement plan and follow it. The\n            MHMS now openly recognize that this is precisely what they\n            need for their own government development budget and are now\n            planning one for their 2013 development budget because of\n            significant delays in 2012 (and earlier) due to a lack of planning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Solomon Islands - Health Sector Support\n            Program

Islands' Health Sector\n            Support Program Technical Assistance Project's\n            development objective is to improve the institutional\n            capacity of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services\n            (MHMS) in the areas of public expenditure management and\n            sector performance monitoring. Such capacity development\n            will be critical to the overall success of the Health Sector\n            Support Program (HSSP) in improving health services delivery\n            and outcomes. The project's first component is: Public\n            Expenditure Management. This project component will\n            contribute technical assistance to complete the first\n            rolling sector Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and\n            improve national MHMS and provincial health planning and\n            budgeting systems and procedures, building on work done\n            during preparation, so that priorities are set within a\n            known resource envelope and linked to expected results. The\n            second component is: Sector performance monitoring. This\n            project component will provide technical assistance to\n            improve the sector-wide program's Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) framework to focus on a core set of\n            indicators covering the key dimensions of sector performance\n            along key dimensions. The third component is: training and\n            capacity building. This component will strengthen the\n            management capacity of senior managers and provincial health\n            directors to be more effective in strategic planning and\n            execution. It will also finance part of the MHMS strategic\n            human resource training plan."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Solomon Islands - Health Sector Support\n            Program Technical Assistance
