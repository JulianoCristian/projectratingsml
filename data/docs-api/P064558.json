Some lessons learned includes: depth over\n            breadth in training and capacity building. While the failure\n            rate of project financed Sub-projects (SPs) is very low, a\n            recurring explanation for failed or lower-than-expected\n            returns for some SPs pertains to beneficiary capacity for\n            adhering to good practices, particularly in livestock. While\n            the project provided over 275,000 person days of training,\n            many of these agro technical in nature, there was a need for\n            sustained monitoring or mentoring that may have improved the\n            efficiency of outcomes. Performance based contracts for\n            better performance. The incentive to Local Implementing\n            Agencies (LIAs), both public and private, needs to be\n            performance based. Project lessons show that Sustainable\n            Land Management (SLM) needs to be economically interesting\n            to be sustainable: Where the economic incentives were lower\n            in the project, there was greater deterioration of\n            project-financed SLM infrastructure, and vice versa. One\n            further lesson emerging from the ICR review of project\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M and E) design relates to\n            support units in the Bank. In exploring the issue of\n            Agriculture Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land Management\n            Project (PRASAB's) weak M and E design, the ICR team\n            concludes that a contributing factor to the poor original\n            design was the delivery of the project at precisely the\n            moment of transition from the project design summary to the\n            modern results framework."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burundi - Agricultural Rehabilitation and\n            Sustainable Land Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burundi - Agricultural\n

This\n            development has declined as a result of the civil war which\n            has lasted 10 years. The project has specific calculations\n            that will result in (a) improving food security of small\n            farmers through increased agricultural production and\n            products farmed in a sustainable manner; (b) an increase in\n            income in rural areas, and thus reducing the poverty level;\n            and (c) reduction of land degradation in specific places and\n            strengthening the management of natural resources. Negative\n            impacts regarding the project include: loss of grazing\n            areas, increase of diseases, noise during pumping,\n            disturbance of aquatic habitat, risk of collapse of dikes,\n            risks of contamination of water by the use of pharmaceutical\n            products, and declining fish stock."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rapport d'etude sur l'analyse\n            d'impact environnemental et social du projet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rapport d\u2019\u00e9tude sur l\u2019analyse\n            d\u2019impact environnemental et social du projet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2008/04/9381249/burundi-agriculture-rehabilitation-sustainable-land-management-supplement-environmental-report-rapport-detude-sur-lanalyse-dimpact-environnemental-social-du-projet","projn":"BI-Agriculture Rehabilitation &\n            Sustainable Land Management -- P064558,BI-Agriculture Rehabilitation &\n            Sustanaible Land Management Suppl -- P110940","docty":"Environmental Assessment","count":"Burundi","authors":{"authr":"Burundi"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000020953_20080423152117"},"theme":"Land administration and management,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Rural non-farm income generation,Rural markets","admreg":"Africa,Africa","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Crops,Central government administration,Animal production,Agro-industry, marketing, and trade","lang":"French","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":",,"}},"owner":"Agric., RD & Irrigt'n Prac 1 (AFTA1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Environment and natural resource management","repnb":"E1873","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Projet de Rehabilitation Agricole et de\n            Gestion Durable des Terres au Burundi : rapport d'etude\n            sur l'analyse d'impact environnemental et social\n            du project"}}},"5025948":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/08/5025948/development-grant-agreement-h117-bi-conformed","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2004/08/5025948/development-grant-agreement-h117-bi-conformed","new_url":"2004/08/5025948/development-grant-agreement-h117-bi-conformed","docm_id":"090224b0807cc799","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0807cc799","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2005/04/13/933ADC12528DC9C685256EEC005E292F/2_0/Rendered/INDEX/DGA01Signing1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/AFR/2005/04/13/933ADC12528DC9C685256EEC005E292F/2_0/Rendered/PDF/DGA01Signing1.pdf","credit_no":"IDAQ3651;IDAH4060;IDAQ3650;IDAH1170","docdt":"2004-08-03T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2004-08-10T00:00:00Z","unregnbr":"40935","docna":{"cdata!":"Development Grant Agreement, H117-BI -
