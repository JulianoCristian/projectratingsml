Piran, an attraction in\n            itself, offers a summer festival of traditional music and is\n            within easy access by road and hovercraft from the major\n            tourist centers of Trieste and Venice. As in Babin Kuk, the\n            project concept of a nucleus hotel with annexes permits\n            operational flexibility and offers potential economies.\n            Management systems will be developed with the assistance of\n            management consultants. The Babin Kuk Project will establish\n            a large integrated tourism complex on the South Adriatic\n            Coast of Yugoslavia in the Republic of Croatia. The site for\n            the project is a small peninsula, about 4 km to the north of\n            the old walled city of Dubrovnik. Partly pine-covered, the\n            area slopes gently from a high point to the sea. It has\n            about 1.5 km of indented rocky coastline, and about 0.5 km\n            to the northeast is the small island of Daksa which has\n            sandy beaches and dense woods. Because of its topography the\n            site offers panoramic views of the sea and surrounding\n            islands, and it has a slightly more favorable climate than\n            the old city. Besides the great scenic beauty of the\n            mountains coastline, the palaces, churches and monasteries\n            of the old city are tourism assets in themselves and provide\n            a unique setting for a summer festival offering music,\n            drama, opera and dance which is a major attraction for\n            tourists. The project is one of the largest so far developed\n            in Yugoslavia or elsewhere. It will include nine hotels with\n            a total of about 5,000 beds; one hotel will be in the luxury\n            class with 300 beds, four will be A class with 1,700 beds,\n            and the remainder B class with 3,000 beds. The four B class\n            hotels will operate seasonally (April-October)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Bernardin and Babin Kuk Tourism Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Bernardin and Babin\n            Kuk Tourism Projects"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1971/06/1556282/yugoslavia-bernardin-babin-kuk-tourism-projects","projn":"Tourism I Bernadin -- P009150,Tourism II Babin Kuk -- P009149","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Housing Finance,Public Sector Economics,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903184983"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other urban development","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Balance of Payments,Bank\n            Loans,Borrower,Budgetary\n            expenditures,commitment,construction,contractors,cost of\n            capital,Debt,Debt financing,debt\n            service,deposits,Disbursements,Ecology,economic\n            development,employment,Exchange rate,expenditures,financial\n            incentives,financial structure,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Guarantee\n            Agreements,Guarantor,imports,income,lender,loan,loan\n            agreement,Loan Agreements,Local Cost Financing,Local\n            Currency Financing,pensions,pollution,project\n            sponsors,provisions,Public Sector,Public\n            services,relending,roads,sal,Savings,sewage,sponsor,subsidiary,traffic\n            congestion,Transport,water supply,Working Capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"Balance of Payments,Bank\n            Loans,Borrower,Budgetary\n            expenditures,commitment,construction,contractors,cost of\n            capital,Debt,Debt financing,debt\n            service,deposits,Disbursements,Ecology,economic\n            development,employment,Exchange rate,expenditures,financial\n            incentives,financial structure,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Guarantee\n            Agreements,Guarantor,imports,income,lender,loan,loan\n            agreement,Loan Agreements,Local Cost Financing,Local\n            Currency Financing,pensions,pollution,project\n            sponsors,provisions,Public Sector,Public\n            services,relending,roads,sal,Savings,sewage,sponsor,subsidiary,traffic\n            congestion,Transport,water supply,Working Capital"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","repnb":"P953"},"facets":{}}}
