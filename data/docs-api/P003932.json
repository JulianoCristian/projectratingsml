Specifically, the loan will support steps taken by the\n            Government in 1986 to: (i) restrain government spending\n            through a 24 percent cut in the 1986/87 development budget;\n            (ii) maintain an appropriate exchange rate, including a 31\n            percent devaluation; and (iii) reform trade policy through\n            measures designed to provide internationally-priced inputs\n            to exporters and to reduce import restrictions. Important\n            aspects of these measures are steps to shift from nontariff\n            barriers (NTBs) to tariffs as the primary instrument of\n            import policy, and to promote foreign investment, expecially\n            in export activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Trade Policy Adjustment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Trade Policy\n            Adjustment Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1986/12/739755/indonesia-trade-policy-adjustment-project","projn":"ID-Trade Adj.
