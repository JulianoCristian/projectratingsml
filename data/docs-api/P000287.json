Three factors subject to government control\n            were found to impede the execution of the project. First,\n            difficulties in assembling a project management team\n            hindered the start up of the project. Second, rapid staff\n            turnover was found to be detrimental to the functioning of\n            health facilities and to the institutional development\n            efforts. More attention needs to be given to understanding\n            and addressing factors contributing to the persistently low\n            utilization of health services. Third, problems in meeting\n            counterpart funding requirements persisted throughout the\n            life of the project. The key lessons learned from the\n            project can be summarized as follows: 1) Adapting flexible\n            and decentralized procedures for channeling funds improves\n            accountability, raise staff motivation, and improves\n            response to local needs. 2) Focusing on improving quality\n            and coverage is insufficient to raising utilization of\n            health services. 3) Adopting a simple monitoring and\n            evaluation system and ensuring that information is used\n            strategically for decision making is critical to successful\n            implementation of projects. 4) Integrating the project\n            management unit into the government's institutional\n            structure is essential to ensuring broad based ownership and\n            project sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Burkina Faso - Health and Nutrition Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Burkina Faso - Health and\n            Nutrition Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2002/03/1735283/burkina-faso-health-nutrition-project","projn":"BF-Health/Nutrition -- P000287","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Systems Development & Reform,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Burkina Faso","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_02032604023140"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic health services,basic\n            services,communities,community health,Community\n            management,decentralization,disease\n            control,districts,epidemiological\n            surveillance,equipment,Essential\n            Drugs,expenditures,extension,families,family\n            planning,financial management,Food Security,Health\n            Committees,health education,health facilities,health\n            investments,Health plans,health projects,Health\n            Sector,health services,health system,health\n            systems,households,Immunization,mass media,measles,Medical\n            Centers,medical\n            personnel,meningitis,mortality,Nutrition,nutritional\n            status,parasitic diseases,performance\n            indicators,Pharmaceutical Services,poverty\n            alleviation,pregnant women,primary health care,Public\n            Health,public sector,quality control,quality of health\n            care,rural\n            areas,screening,supervision,Sustainability,vaccination,village\n            health workers,villages,workers,working conditions"},"1":{"cdata!":"basic health services,basic\n            services,communities,community health,Community\n            management,decentralization,disease\n            control,districts,epidemiological\n            surveillance,equipment,Essential\n            Drugs,expenditures,extension,families,family\n            planning,financial management,Food Security,Health\n            Committees,health education,health facilities,health\n            investments,Health plans,health projects,Health\n            Sector,health services,health system,health\n            systems,households,Immunization,mass media,measles,Medical\n            Centers,medical\n            personnel,meningitis,mortality,Nutrition,nutritional\n            status,parasitic diseases,performance\n            indicators,Pharmaceutical Services,poverty\n            alleviation,pregnant women,primary health care,Public\n            Health,public sector,quality control,quality of health\n            care,rural\n            areas,screening,supervision,Sustainability,vaccination,village\n            health workers,villages,workers,working conditions"}},"owner":"AFT: Human Development 2 (AFTH2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"3":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF038890-BURKINA FASO - SUPERVISION OF\n            HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT,TF022100-ITALIAN CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF021651-DANISH GRANT TO WSP FOR S.
