A handy\n            portmanteau definition of watershed development is as\n            follows: a watershed may be defined as a geographic area\n            that drains to a common point. Integrated watershed\n            development is generally understood as an approach that\n            combines soil and water conservation with social and\n            institutional development, in addition to pursuing a broad\n            range of activities that meet the felt needs of communities\n            across many sectors, such as rural access, water supply, and\n            income-generating activities.  Assessing watershed\n            development and forest interventions side-by-side is no idle\n            juxtaposition. Obviously, all forests fall within watersheds\n            so there is some merit to having a natural resources\n            management strategy that includes both.  In designing\n            watershed and forest interventions there is a common theme.\n            Both types of project are beset by problems of property\n            rights that have been incompletely specified or questionably\n            assigned or are simply missing. This report assesses two\n            watershed development projects and one forestry project. The\n            objectives of the watershed development projects in the\n            Shivalik Hills and in Karnataka were similar: both sought to\n            improve the productive potential of selected watersheds and\n            to build the institutions needed for improved management of\n            the natural resource base, including community organizations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

Development Project for India was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: Natural Resource Management (NRM) interventions\n            planned and implemented through local communities benefit\n            from local knowledge, better integration of conservation\n            goals with local livelihood concerns. Since many\n            conservation measures typically benefit land-holders,\n            pro-poor interventions in watershed projects are helpful in\n            creating a stake in the project for the weaker and marginal\n            segments of the community as well. Facilitation (helping\n            with the strengthening of relevant local institutions,\n            processes and capacities) is at least as critical an input\n            as external finance in helping communities address their\n            conservation and development concerns. Project experience\n            shows that social mobilization and community capacity\n            building take time to start up but work powerfully when\n            matured. Complexity in implementation of multi-state\n            projects can be reduced significantly by a system of joint\n            supervisions and a shared learning platform. A significant\n            output of this project is the up-grading of\n            skills/capacities of project staff. In a multi-state\n            project, greater uniformity in recording and reporting\n            systems is needed to facilitate comparisons as well as\n            project self-appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
