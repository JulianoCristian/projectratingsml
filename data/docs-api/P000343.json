It consists of: (a) reconstruction of the\n            Garoua-Figuil road (95 km) to two-lane paved standards; and\n            (b) technical assistance and fellowships to strengthen the\n            planning and coordination capacity of the Ministry of\n            Transport. The Third Highway Project would improve land\n            transport facilities for the external trade of Northern\n            Cameroon and Chad, and form an important part of the overall\n            development effort for Northern Cameroon by serving\n            agricultural, industrial and administrative centers. It\n            would also assist in better allocating scarce resources in\n            the transport sector. The risk that the main project\n            benefits would not materialize due to cost increases is\n            minimal, since the reconstruction contract has already been\n            awarded and work is starting."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cameroon - Third Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cameroon - Third Highway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/01/1557088/cameroon-third-highway-project","projn":"CM-Roads Iii-266313 -- P000343","docty":"President's Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Municipal Financial Management,Roads & Highways","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Cameroon","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902293039"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"acceleration,accounting,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Balance of Payments,Bank\n            loans,bottlenecks,bridges,capital goods,carrying\n            capacity,cement,climatic\n            conditions,consolidation,construction,current prices,daily\n            traffic,debt,deceleration,deficits,development\n            projects,economic expansion,economic\n            growth,employment,entrepreneurship,exchange\n            rate,exploitation,exports,farm access roads,Feeder\n            Roads,financial resources,FISCAL YEAR,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,framework,GDP,GNP,gravel,gravel\n            roads,gross national savings,Highway\n            Projects,Highways,housing,imports,income,income\n            distribution,inflation,interest rate,intermediate\n            goods,international reserves,land transport,natural\n            resources,oil,operating costs,pavement,PCU,Population\n            growth,private consumption,productivity,Public debt,Public\n            Finance,public savings,public services,public utilities,Rate\n            of Return,real income,road construction,road\n            investments,road maintenance,road networks,road\n            planning,road surface,road system,road transport,routine\n            maintenance,saturation,savings,secondary\n            roads,Soils,technical assistance,terms of trade,timber,Total\n            Costs,traffic,Transport,transport planning,transport\n            projects,transportation,trucking,trunk roads,urban\n            development,vehicle loads,vehicle operating costs,waiting time"},"1":{"cdata!":"acceleration,accounting,agricultural\n            production,agriculture,Balance of Payments,Bank\n            loans,bottlenecks,bridges,capital goods,carrying\n            capacity,cement,climatic\n            conditions,consolidation,construction,current prices,daily\n            traffic,debt,deceleration,deficits,development\n            projects,economic expansion,economic\n            growth,employment,entrepreneurship,exchange\n            rate,exploitation,exports,farm access roads,Feeder\n            Roads,financial resources,FISCAL YEAR,fishing,foreign\n            exchange,forestry,framework,GDP,GNP,gravel,gravel\n            roads,gross national savings,Highway\n            Projects,Highways,housing,imports,income,income\n            distribution,inflation,interest rate,intermediate\n            goods,international reserves,land transport,natural\n            resources,oil,operating costs,pavement,PCU,Population\n            growth,private consumption,productivity,Public debt,Public\n            Finance,public savings,public services,public utilities,Rate\n            of Return,real income,road construction,road\n            investments,road maintenance,road networks,road\n            planning,road surface,road system,road transport,routine\n            maintenance,saturation,savings,secondary\n            roads,Soils,technical assistance,terms of trade,timber,Total\n            Costs,traffic,Transport,transport planning,transport\n            projects,transportation,trucking,trunk roads,urban\n            development,vehicle loads,vehicle operating costs,waiting time"}},"owner":"WB Off: Yaounde-Central Africa 1 (AFCC1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"P2189"},"facets":{}}}
