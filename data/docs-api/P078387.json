Ratings\n            for the Second Phase Road Development Project for Uganda\n            were as follows: outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was high, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: The\n            road agency model has provided sufficient institutional\n            capacity in low income countries such as Tanzania and Uganda\n            to improve the delivery of new main roads and their\n            maintenance. Supporting road funds can further enhance road\n            sub-sector reform provided they are properly designed and\n            adequately resourced. During road reform initiatives, the\n            borrower's absorptive capacity, the degree of\n            opposition to change and the time it takes to prepare and\n            adopt new legislation, have often been miscalculated by the\n            Bank and other development partners. The Bank thus needs to\n            ensure appropriate training and skills deployment to i)\n            assess and address the borrower's institutional and\n            absorptive capacity limitations; ii) gauge the degree of\n            resistance to change and make a plan to deal with it, and\n            iii) realistically estimate the time it takes to prepare,\n            adopt and apply new legislation. An annual assessment of the\n            condition and traffic usage of the roads in the network\n            enables the decision makers and the public to understand the\n            implications of

satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the monitoring\n            and evaluation framework should be comprehensive and\n            indicative, showing the path to the project development\n            objectives. The output and intermediate indicators should\n            closely link and be fully reflective to outcome indicators\n            so that the project progress could be closely monitored,\n            correct actions could be adopted when necessary. A railway\n            cannot compete with road transport for multiple small\n            consignments. Such consignments were the core load of\n            Tanzania Railway Corporation (TRC) prior to concessioning.\n            During the two years of uncertainty between the bidding for\n            the concession and the eventual signing of the concession\n            agreement with the winning bidder the majority of the load\n            was lost to road transport and the concessionaire had no\n            chance to win the lost load share back for the railway. In\n            the current concession designs, the potential concessionaire\n            is faced with obligations to invest in liquidating the\n            backlog of maintenance and subsequently maintaining the\n            assets in workable conditions. When the infrastructure is in\n            very poor condition and heavy investment is required to\n            restore the infrastructure to standard condition, then the\n            burden on the

TAZARA).To this end, through its components the project\n            will: 1) upgrade strategic road links, which  includes the\n            rehabilitation of 3 different road sections on\n            Zanzibar's sea shore, in addition to the Singida-Shelui\n            Road (110 km) leading from the region's headquarters,\n            to the border of the Tabora region, and, the roads starting\n            at Mkwajuni along the coastal valley to Nungwi;\n            Matemwe-Pongwe road; Paje-Pingwe road; all three areas of\n            strategic tourism importance. In addition, the\n            rehabilitation of 5 key ferries is being proposed, subject\n            to study recommendations, as well as proposals on the option\n            of concessioning to private operators.  The component will\n            also finance feasibility studies and detailed engineering\n            designs regarding road upgrading; 2) support TANROADS build\n            its headquarters in Dar es Salaam, and, will fund civil\n            works and supervision. It will assist TANROADS carry out a\n            job evaluation, determine the level of staffing and identify\n            areas that require strengthening. It will also help them\n            identify skills not available within the organization that\n            would need to be out-sourced in the short and medium term\n            while the organizations makes alternative long term plans.\n            Transport studies financed by the component include Dar es\n            Salaam Rapid Bus Transit and Traffic Management Study, and\n            several studies in the transport sector to cover not only\n            roads, but ports and other related aspects. Training and\n            technical assistance will be provided; 3) Improve\n            infrastructure of the Tanzania Railway Corporation,\n            proposing a concession that will include a 25-year lease for\n            the TRC railway network, with the right to manage, and\n            maintain the network, and lease of TRC locomotives and\n            rolling stock. The concessionaire will also have the\n            exclusive right on the TRC network to operate freight\n            services and passenger services for the period, with an\n            obligation to

standards, to include drainage systems,\n            bypassing the hilly section of Sekenke (which cuts across a\n            dense forest) so as to prevent deforesation. In order to\n            extend sustainable rural production to the road influence,\n            promote access, and lower transport costs, the road\n            improvements would enhance socioeconomic development,\n            including the tourism sector. However, adverse environmental\n            impacts, such as soil erosion, loss of farmland, wildlife,\n            and natural habitats, as well as air, water and soil\n            pollution, in addition to safety and health hazards, call\n            for an environmental management to mitigate adversity, as\n            follows. To minimize impacts on wildlife, and forests,\n            sensitive areas should be realigned by separating road and\n            forest with green barriers, and, providing road crossings\n            for wildlife by smoothing embankment slopes at regular\n            distances, opening river weirs, and large culverts in\n            swamplands. The road design should blend in with the\n            landscape, avoiding cuts as possible, but stabilizing\n            necessary cuts with protective walls, favoring\n            re-vegetation. Culverts and cross-drainage should be\n            designed to maintain the hydraulic balance, including borrow\n            pit excavation and restoration, to avoid stagnation. Soil\n            erosion, sedimentation in drainage lines, and cascade\n            effects in drains can be minimized by paving drain outlet\n            areas with stones and concrete. Road safety measures should\n            be in place, as well as the creation of green barriers to\n            reduce dust and gas exhaustions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Central Transport

production to\n            the road influence, to promote access, and lower transport\n            costs. To this end, the Singida Shelui Road - connecting Dar\n            es Salaam with northwestern Tanzania, and with landlocked\n            Rwanda, Burundi, and eastern Congo - will be upgraded to\n            bitumen standards (including drainage systems), bypassing\n            the hilly section of Sekenke (which cuts across a dense\n            forest) so as to prevent deforesation. Nevertheless,\n            implementation of the project, namely the Singida Shelui\n            Road upgrade, will have negative impacts on the people\n            living in, or in the proximity of major towns and villages\n            along the route. Relocation will be necessary of both\n            residential buildings, businesses or community facilities,\n            and farms. This resettlement action plan aims at improving,\n            or at least restoring, the livelihoods of project affected\n            people (PAP) to their current living standards. Following\n            community consultations, compensation will be provided as\n            follows: real estate losses will be paid at market values;\n            business and income losses will be paid, based on assessed\n            monthly net profits evidenced by audit accounts, multiplied\n            by thirty six months; agricultural land losses will be paid\n            at replacement costs, or in cash compensations, while crop\n            losses will be compensated on estimated market values. The\n            costs of relocation, and moving expenses will be covered,\n            and, grievance mechanisms will be in place should complaints\n            trigger the need for dispute resolution."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Central Transport Corridor Roads\n            Project : resettlement plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Central Transport\n            Corridor Roads Project : resettlement plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/05/2438505/tanzania-central-transport-corridor-roads-project-resettlement-plan","projn":"TZ-Central Transport Corridor Project -- P078387","docty":"Resettlement Plan","subtopic":"Real Estate Development,Environmental Economics & Policies,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Housing,Municipal Housing and Land","teratopic":"Urban Development","count":"Tanzania","authors":{"authr":"TECHNIPLAN"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03071704231693"},"subsc":"Roads and highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Urban Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"building materials,commercial\n            banks,communities,construction,countryside,Districts,electric\n            power,farms,hotels,households,houses,huts,income,inhabitants,inventory,land\n            owner,land ownership,land resources,land tenure,Land\n            Title,land use,leases,legislation,local authorities,natural\n            resources,occupancy,physical planning,property\n            rights,rangelands,Real estate,real estates,real\n            property,renting,rents,repair,resettlement,residences,residential\n            areas,restaurants,road safety,Roads,rural areas,rural\n            communities,rural\n            settlements,settlers,squatters,towns,traffic,Urban\n            Areas,Urban Development,urban infrastructure,urban\n            land,urban land use,Utilities,villages,waste disposal"},"1":{"cdata!":"building materials,commercial\n            banks,communities,construction,countryside,Districts,electric\n            power,farms,hotels,households,houses,huts,income,inhabitants,inventory,land\n            owner,land ownership,land resources,land tenure,Land\n            Title,land use,leases,legislation,local authorities,natural\n            resources,occupancy,physical planning,property\n            rights,rangelands,Real estate,real estates,real\n            property,renting,rents,repair,resettlement,residences,residential\n            areas,restaurants,road safety,Roads,rural areas,rural\n            communities,rural\n            settlements,settlers,squatters,towns,traffic,Urban\n            Areas,Urban Development,urban infrastructure,urban\n            land,urban land use,Utilities,villages,waste disposal"}},"owner":"Transport Practice Group (AFTTR)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"RP168"},"facets":{}}}
