Most of the physical targets\n            were achieved, the impact of the project has been\n            significant, sustainability is likely under certain\n            conditions, and both the Borrower and the Bank acted\n            satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the Bank should examine beforehand whether\n            the action proposed to be taken to substitute for\n            non-compliance of a covenant would fully serve the desired\n            purpose. Second, it should spell out clearly and give more\n            prominence at appraisal to the \"software\"\n            component of a project. Third, the Bank needs to ensure a\n            prior commitment of the government to sustain the\n            institutional capability developed after the expiry of the\n            project period. Fourth, it should assess the social and\n            legal framework in which the project is to be executed\n            before incorporating under the project proposals which a\n            priori would have little meaning. Lastly, the Government of\n            Pakistan should clearly understand a project's short\n            and long term objectives as well as its financial\n            implications. It should also understand the need for a total\n            commitment to its successful undertaking."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - Grain Storage Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Pakistan -
