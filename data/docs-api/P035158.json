The lessons\n            learned indicate that enabling policies and institutional\n            changes are key for improved irrigation service delivery.\n            Involvement of project beneficiaries groups is key to create\n            ownership of project interventions and their sustainability.\n            Longer term support to Water Users Associations (WUAs) is\n            required for the capacity building and their sustainability.\n            Early identification and close monitoring of key project\n            activities  are critical for timely completion of the\n            project. Complementing irrigation improvement with strong\n            agriculture support services from project inception is key\n            to maximize project benefits and promote sustainability.\n            Simplification of procurement processes within the\n            government is key to timely award and completion of project\n            activities. Timely implementation of land acquisition and\n            Resettlement and Rehabilitation (R&R) is a prerequisite\n            for scheduled completion of project. Effective coordination\n            between Irrigation and command Area Development Department\n            (I&CADD) and Department of Agriculture (DoA) is critical\n            for improving the

      productivity and rural incomes in two economically backward\n            regions of Andhra Pradesh. The other objectives are: (1)\n            pilot implementation of management reforms to improve public\n            irrigation performance and to upgrade the government s\n            capacity to improve irrigation services and command area\n            management; (2) retrospectively mitigating the adverse\n            impacts of land acquisition under the APII, and proactively\n            provide economic rehabilitation for those families still to\n            be affected by completing the Srisailam Right Branch Canal\n            Project (SRBC) works; (3) ensuring the safety and\n            sustainability of three dams supplying water to the project\n            areas; (4) implementing a mandated regional program of\n            environmental improvements, safeguards, and natural resource\n            conservation; and (5) improving government monitoring and\n            evaluation capacity for large irrigation projects. Six\n            components are needed to achieve project objectives: (1)\n            Irrigation Development and Rehabilitation Works-supporting\n            completion of all SRBC civil works begun under   APII; and\n            selected civil works under the Sriramasagar Project (SRSP);\n            (2) Agricultural Services Programs-applying research and\n            demonstrating irrigation practices and agronomy,\n            establishing water users association, and providing training\n            to staff and farmers;  (3) Resettlement and Rehabilitation\n            Program-economically rehabilitating families adversely\n            affected by acquiring past and proposed land for SRBC and\n            SRSP works; (4) Environmental Management Plan-supporting\n            India s mandated regional program of environmental\n            safeguards and nature conservation in command area\n            districts; (5) Dam Safety Assurance Works-supporting\n            investments to maintain the structural and mechanical\n            integrity of dams, and preventing failure of the Srisailam\n            dam spillway; and (6) Project Monitoring and
