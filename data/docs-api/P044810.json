Some\n            lessons learned included: the project was approved at the\n            brink of the election which led to the change of the\n            Government. Two more governments came to power during the\n            life of the project. While each of these changes had major\n            impact on the project, the change in 2001 was the most\n            critical. The reforms that the project represented lost some\n            of its protagonists and leaders and the ownership of and\n            commitment to the reforms was diluted. The implementation of\n            the project key reforms (court administration and case\n            management reforms) revealed that the success of the reforms\n            requires the strong commitment and ownership of the capable\n            leaders on both levels; the central level as well as the\n            medium and lower level. It also proves that the leadership,\n            commitment and ownership are essential for the project from\n            its beginning to the end. The project originated in the\n            private sector department portfolio and stayed part of the\n            Private Sector Development (PSD) portfolio for the life of\n            the project. In hindsight, the project should have been\n            formally transferred to the Poverty Reduction and Economic\n            Management (PREM) portfolio, as therein lay its focus. By\n            doing so, it might have been able to benefit from improved\n            team supervision, with justice sector reform and broader\n            governance and institutional expertise, and increased\n            management attention and supervision."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh - Legal and Judicial Capacity\n            Building

           improve the environment for doing business by increasing the\n            efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of the civil\n            justice system, and increase access to justice, particularly\n            for women and the poor. The overall results of the project\n            should provide a solid foundation for protecting against\n            corruption and improving governance in the country. There\n            are five project components. The first component strengthens\n            court administration and reduces delays, improves case\n            management, installs a court management information system\n            and automation, provides training and upgrading of training\n            facilities, provides other human resource needs that raise\n            the stature of the judiciary and regulate the court\n            performance of all levels of the judiciary, and upgrades\n            court infrastructure. The second component improves access\n            to justice by raising the level of gender sensitivity;\n            developing an alternative dispute resolution mechanism,\n            strengthening small cause courts, and improving access to\n            legal aid; and promoting legal literacy and public awareness\n            at the grassroots level, on a national level, and through\n            the bar associations. The third, fourth, and fifth\n            components strengthen the law commission and the ministry of\n            law, finance studies that prepare for future reforms, and\n            support project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
