HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and\n            Tuberculosis Control Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and\n            Tuberculosis Control Project for Djibouti were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was low, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was highly satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: getting the support at the highest political level\n            made a huge difference in implementation. The creation of\n            the Interministerial Committee, later transformed into the\n            CCMI (Comite de Coordination Multisectorielle et\n            Inter-partenariale), succeeded in mobilizing the\n            multi-sectoral and community-based activities and donor\n            support. Moreover, it was important to engage religious\n            leaders. Trained religious leaders and imams were often\n            called on to conduct advocacy and question and answer\n            sessions. The early delays in implementation were caused by\n            the focus on strengthening the management capacity and\n            qualified staffing of the newly established Executive\n            Secretariat (ES) and on the development of detailed\n            guidelines and procedures. However, later on, this\n            investment accelerated the implementation guided by the\n            protocols and procedures manuals. Although prevention of\n            HIV/AIDS, including Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT),\n            remains the most cost-effective weapon in the fight against\n            the epidemic compared to Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment,\n            insight and closer consideration of epidemiologic and\n            cultural aspects led to the conclusion that prevention\n            (particularly VCT services) would fail unless ARV treatment\n            was simultaneously offered. As a result, the project\n            introduced and scaled up ARV treatment until the GF (Global\n            Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria) took over. It\n            was later shown in service statistics that VCT utilization\n            increased, particularly among the young and educated, when\n            they were assured of access to affordable treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti - HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and\n            Tuberculosis Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Djibouti - HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and\n

risk cofactors.\n            There are 4 components to the project: 1) The capacity\n            building and policy development will aim at strengthening\n            Djibouti's capacity to cope with the spread of\n            HIV/AIDS, and to control malaria and tuberculosis. 2) The\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) and more broadly the health\n            community have special responsibilities for the prevention\n            and management of HIV/AIDS/STIs, malaria, and other\n            opportunistic infections - including malaria, and\n            tuberculosis. 3) As demonstrated in other countries, in\n            order for the control of HIV/AIDS to be effective, it is\n            necessary to have a multisectoral approach to better target\n            priority vulnerable groups. The preparation process of the\n            National Strategic Plan has demonstrated that the MOH could\n            not by itself deliver all the essential prevention, and\n            impact. 4) In order to enlist communities in controlling\n            HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and to provide them\n            with the means to mitigate the impact of these diseases, it\n            is necessary to provide resources at the local level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Djibouti - HIV/AIDS, Malaria and\n            Tuberculosis Control Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Djibouti -

risk cofactors.\n            There are 4 components to the project: 1) The capacity\n            building and policy development will aim at strengthening\n            Djibouti's capacity to cope with the spread of\n            HIV/AIDS, and to control malaria and tuberculosis. 2) The\n            Ministry of Health (MOH) and more broadly the health\n            community have special responsibilities for the prevention\n            and management of HIV/AIDS/STIs, malaria, and other\n            opportunistic infections - including malaria, and\n            tuberculosis. 3) As demonstrated in other countries, in\n            order for the control of HIV/AIDS to be effective, it is\n            necessary to have a multisectoral approach to better target\n            priority vulnerable groups. The preparation process of the\n            National Strategic Plan has demonstrated that the MOH could\n            not by itself deliver all the essential prevention, and\n            impact. 4) In order to enlist communities in controlling\n            HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and to provide them\n            with the means to mitigate the impact of these diseases, it\n            is necessary to provide resources at the local level."},"docna":{"cdata!":"A la republique de Djibouti pour un projet\n            de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA, le paludisme et la tuberculose"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Djibouti \u2013 Projet de lutte contre\n            le VIH/SIDA, le paludisme et la tuberculose : A la\n            R\u00e9publique de Djibouti pour un projet de lutte contre le\n            VIH/SIDA, le paludisme et la tuberculose"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/04/2361803/djibouti-hivaids-malaria-tuberculosis-control-project-la-republique-de-djibouti-pour-un-projet-de-lutte-contre-le-vihsida-le-paludisme-la-tuberculose","projn":"DJ-Hiv/Aids, Malaria And Tuberculosis\n            Control Project -- P073603","docty":"Project Appraisal Document","count":"Djibouti","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20030528145933"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"HIV infections; Acquired immune deficiency\n            syndrome; Malaria; Tuberculosis; Capacity building; Policy\n            development; Health planning; Vulnerable groups;"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026825-PHRD-DJIBOUTI: NATIONAL AIDS CONTROL","repnb":"25264","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"A la republique de Djibouti pour un\n            projet de lutte contre le VIH/SIDA, le paludisme et la tuberculose"}}},"2216149":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/04/2216149/djibouti-hivaids-malaria-tuberculosis-control-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2003/04/2216149/djibouti-hivaids-malaria-tuberculosis-control-project","new_url":"2003/04/2216149/djibouti-hivaids-malaria-tuberculosis-control-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/04/25/000094946_0304150403448/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/04/25/000094946_0304150403448/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"Q322;H042","datestored":"2003-08-16T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2003-04-07T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Djibouti -
