Some lessons\n            learned included: in Latvia, the comprehensive spending\n            review undertaken jointly by the World Bank and\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) allowed the Government to\n            rapidly design a relevant program to respond to the crisis.\n            An important lesson from Latvia was that investing in\n            economic and social data analysis in good times and on a\n            regular basis is all the more relevant in a time of crisis,\n            especially given that the cost of such practice remains low.\n            The World Bank's support through the Special\n            Development Policy Loan (SDPL) series provided a framework\n            for the Government's policy reforms in the social\n            sectors during a time of deep fiscal cuts. The reform\n            experience in Latvia has shown that pension expenditures\n            exhibit very high inertia in times of recessions and even\n            extremely reform-minded governments are not able to quickly\n            reduce spending on such programs. Pension spending actually\n            increased by 27 percent in real terms over 2008-2010.\n            Although the Constitutional Court ruling about the pension\n            reform was very specific and related to the lack of\n            consultation on allowing cuts in pensions, the Government\n            did not pursue their reform. Budget rules should take into\n            account economic cycles. It is important to consider the\n            trajectory of social protection expenditures particularly\n            unemployment benefits and social safety net support programs\n            across the economic cycle in designing fiscal rules and\n            buffer-stock savings mechanisms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Safety Net and Social Sector Reform\n            Program

It covered the costs of transporting\n            students from communities where schools have closed to the\n            new places of instruction and increased the coverage and\n            pay-out period of unemployment insurance.

Given the deep impact Latvia has suffered in\n            the wake of the global crisis, and due to the emergency\n            nature of this program, the first operation will focus\n            mainly on the first and second objectives. The second\n            operation will expand this focus to the third objective. The\n            financial crisis hit Latvia at a time when the country was\n            particularly vulnerable, and its impact has been felt more\n            deeply than elsewhere in the region, the economy is\n            estimated to have declined by 18 percent in 2009 and to\n            further contract by 4 percent in 2010. The program of World\n            Bank support will focus on measures designed to mitigate the\n            social impact of fiscal consolidation, and on the\n            implementation of the Government's cross sector\n            Emergency Social Safety Net Strategy (ESSNS). To increase\n            transparency and accountability, the ESSNS includes\n            procedures for and adequate financing to closely monitor its\n            implementation and rigorously evaluate its impact."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia - Safety Net and Social Sector Reform Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Latvia - Safety Net and Social\n            Sector Reform
