Some lessons\n            learned included: for many producers, credit, especially\n            long-term credit to finance part of irrigation\n            rehabilitation, is not the appropriate instrument. As the\n            first order of business, an irrigation project has to\n            demonstrate to farmers that the volume and quality of their\n            products (and thus income) will be enhanced through a given\n            operation before farmers commit to the objective of the\n            project. High costs investments on equipment and facilities\n            should only be undertaken once ownership, operations and\n            management have been well settled. Otherwise there is the\n            real possibility, as was the case under PDIAIM I and II,\n            that the equipment and facilities will not be used (case of\n            facility in Rosso) or for completely different purposes\n            (case of Nouakchott where the project financed a cold\n            storage facility that was intended for vegetables to be\n            exported and is now being used to conserve fish).\n            Satisfactory disbursement figures can be misleading as they\n            may hide significant cost overruns, as was the case for\n            irrigation rehabilitation under this project. In addition,\n            APLs, by their very nature, have disbursement categories\n            that are broad and not easy to match disbursements with\n            quantitative achievement of physical outputs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Second Phase of Integrated\n            Development Program for Irrigated Agriculture Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Mauritania - Second Phase of\n            Integrated Development Program for Irrigated Agriculture Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2014/11/20467632/mauritania-second-phase-integrated-development-program-irrigated-agriculture-project","count":"Mauritania","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to credit, access to financing,\n            accountability, accounting, administrative regions,\n            agricultural bank, Agricultural Cooperatives, agricultural\n            credit, Agricultural extension, agricultural inputs,\n            agricultural markets, agricultural producers, agricultural\n            product, agricultural production, agricultural products,\n            Agricultural Research, Agricultural Sector, agricultural\n            services, AGRICULTURE, animal health, approval process,\n            arable land, Audits, Bank financing, Bank Lending, Bank\n            Ratings, banking system, beneficiary population, Beneficiary\n            Survey, Borrower, capacity building, climate change, cold\n            storage, commercial banks, commercial farmers,\n            consolidation, cost-sharing, credit approval, Credit\n            Cooperatives, Credit institution, credits, Crop\n            diversification, data storage, debts, Development Bank,\n            Development Center, Development Corporation, development\n            projects, direct beneficiaries, diversification, drainage,\n            drip irrigation, drought, drought recovery, economic growth,\n            economics, emergency situation, emergency situations,\n            employment, equipment, Exchange Rate, Expenditure,\n            expenditures, exploitation, export markets, Farm Management,\n            farmer, farmers, feasibility studies, feed, fertilizers,\n            Financial Analysis, financial difficulties, financial\n            difficulty, financial institution, Financial Management,\n            Financial performance, financial self-sufficiency, financial\n            viability, fish, food insecurity, FOOD PRICE, food safety,\n            Food Security, food shortage, food shortages, food staples,\n            gender, gender aspects, government policy, herders, high\n            interest rate, high interest rates, households, ID, import\n            tariffs, incomes, inflation, Information System,\n            institutional capacities, institutional capacity,\n            institutional support, Irrigation, job opportunities, Key\n            Performance Indicators, lack of credit, lack of information,\n            Land administration, land ownership, land registration, land\n            registrations, land registries, land rights, land tenure,\n            land titles, land titling, land use, laws, legislation, line\n            of credit, Livestock, Livestock Productivity, Loan, loan\n            portfolio, marketing, matching grants, natural assets,\n            Natural disasters, Operational Risk, poor, poor farmers,\n            poor villages, potable water, Poverty Reduction, Poverty\n            Reduction Strategy, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,\n            private entrepreneurs, private sector, Producer\n            Organizations, producers organizations, production credit,\n            production systems, profitability, public expenditures,\n            purchasing power, regional project, Regional Vice President,\n            registration process, repayment, Risk Management, risk\n            mitigation, Rural, rural areas, rural communities, rural\n            credit, Rural Development, rural finance, rural\n            institutions, Rural markets, rural public, Rural Strategy,\n            safeguard policies, safeguards, safeguards policies, Safety\n            Net, Savings, self-financing, sheep, smallholders, social\n            impacts, start-up, storage facilities, sub-loans,\n            subsistence, supply chain, Supply Chains, targeting,\n            technical assistance, transaction costs, Transport, Union,\n            vegetable crops, vegetables, Village, villages, vulnerable\n            groups, Water Resources"}},"majtheme":"Rural development,Trade and integration,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development","projn":"MR-Integrated Development Program For\n            Irrigated Agric.

This memorandum seeks your\n            approval for a third restructuring of the project in order\n            to enable the board approval during the month of July 2012\n            of an additional financing to the project that will include\n            an emergency and food price response component.

The change\n            consists only of extending the closing date by three months,\n            from July 1st, 2012 to September 30, 2012.
