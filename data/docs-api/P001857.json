The lessons\n            learned indicate the following: a) Project Design: Baseline\n            Data: Accurate statistical data are important for setting\n            targets and objectives during project preparation. The\n            program under review illustrates well these requirements,\n            regarding how baseline data can alter assessment towards\n            reaching development objectives b) Specific Education\n            Interventions: Equity and Textbooks Production and\n            Distribution: (i) Project intervention to restore equity in\n            access to quality must be carefully targeted to the students\n            most in need of assistance: those from lower income families\n            usually have no access to necessary material, such as\n            textbooks. Textbooks distribution policy in Mauritania was\n            based on selling textbooks to students in the early stage of\n            the project and was made free of charge as poor students\n            were not able to pay for textbooks; and (ii) Capacity to\n            produce textbooks could be created in the Ministry of\n            Education (public sector); however, printing and\n            distributing textbooks in a cost-effective manner are better\n            suited to the private rather than to the public sector.\n            Local Communities' Contribution to School Construction:\n            Stakeholders' participation in all phases of\n            implementation is crucial for optimizing results. The\n            project should ensure that there are mechanisms to promote\n            public awareness and nurturing community understanding of\n            the project. It is also important that communities\n            (particularly in rural areas) be sensitized early on, so\n            they have time to plan ways to make a significant\n            contribution. The strong commitment by high-level political\n            authorities is a key factor in the successful implementation\n            of project activities that lead to the attainment of\n            development objectives. The General Education V Project\n            illustrates how much members of Government, right up to the\n            highest level were committed to encouraging girls'\n            education and textbooks availability at school, and made it\n            a priority area, both in terms of sensitization activities\n            and in resource allocation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mauritania - Fifth
