Lessons\n            learned from the project are as follows: The project\n            structure combining public sector management and\n            infrastructure was too complex. Subnational Governments\n            institutional strengthening projects should be focused in\n            terms of the areas of intervention and number of clients.\n            Projects aimed at provincial changes should offer a flexible\n            but limited menu of assistance to address the variety of\n            circumstances and reform needs. The menu, however, needs to\n            reflect national priorities while respecting the autonomy of\n            provincial governments.
