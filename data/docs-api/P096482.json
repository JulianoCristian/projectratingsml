Some lessons learned includes:\n            rigor and candor in the Bank's supervision can play a\n            pivotal role in capacity building. The task team\n            leader's presence in the field and his rigorous,\n            pedagogical approach to accompanying and guiding the\n            Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme (PNLP) in\n            strategic management and oversight of the project (and\n            program) were consistently cited as being a critical factor\n            of success in strengthening Benin's capacity, and\n            recognized as an important comparative advantage of the\n            Bank. Even within a single disease program, a sector-wide\n            approach can achieve great synergies and efficiencies in\n            planning, financing, implementation, evaluation. The\n            seamless coordination and collaboration among the Roll Back\n            Malaria (RBM) partners has culminated in a number of good\n            practices and efficiencies. It is possible to support a\n            single disease through a health systems approach. Disease\n            control and health systems strengthening are not mutually\n            exclusive. Quality of supervision depends in part on\n            striking the right balance between depth and breadth of\n            supervision efforts. There is evidence and strong consensus\n            that both the quantity and quality of supervision needs to\n            be increased and that quality supervision requires the\n            proper technical expertise. Community malaria workers were\n            pivotal in the success of the malaria program. While not\n            directly financed under the Bank's project, these\n            workers were the first point of contact of children under\n            five suffering from malaria symptoms. Community-level\n            treatment has enhanced the ability of the health system to\n            treat children within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms and,\n            according to health facility staff, contributed to a decline\n            in severe cases."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Malaria Control Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Malaria Control Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/12/15680318/benin-malaria-control-support-project","projn":"BJ-Benin: Malaria Control Booster Program -- P096482","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Adolescent Health,Housing & Human Habitats,Disease Control & Prevention,Population Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Benin","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000350881_20120125084524"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Other social services,Health","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abortion, access to services, Access to\n            Treatment, adult morbidity, age groups, aggressive, anemia,\n            Antenatal care, antimalarials, Back Malaria, basic health,\n            basic health services, Behavior change, burden of disease,\n            burden of malaria, capacity building, case management, Child\n            health, child mortality, clinics, communities, community\n            development, community health, community health workers,\n            community involvement, cost effectiveness, deaths of\n            children, decision making, description, Development\n            Objectives, diagnostics, Disease, Disease Control, diseases,\n            dissemination, districts, drug supply, drugs, early years,\n            economic development, effective use, essential commodities,\n            fever, Gender, health authorities, health centers, health\n            facilities, health facility, Health Management, health\n            providers, Health Sector, health services, Health system,\n            health systems, health workers, HIV/AIDS, Hospital,\n            hospitals, households, Human Capital, human resource\n            management, hygiene, Information System, insecticides,\n            institutional capacity, intervention, levels of mortality,\n            local authorities, local radio stations, low birth weight,\n            MALARIA, malaria burden, malaria cases, MALARIA CONTROL,\n            malaria deaths, malaria diagnosis, Malaria in pregnancy,\n            malaria interventions, malaria morbidity, malaria mortality,\n            malaria prevention, Malaria Report, malaria symptoms,\n            Malaria Treatment, malarial drugs, maternal mortality,\n            measles, medical supplies, medication, medicines, midwives,\n            Millennium Development Goal, Ministry of Health, morbidity,\n            morbidity and mortality, mortality, mortality rate, National\n            Health, national policy, negative effects, number of deaths,\n            nurses, Nutrition, parasite resistance, parasites,\n            participatory process, patients, perinatal mortality,\n            pesticides, Population strategy, pregnancy, pregnant women,\n            prevention activities, prevention interventions, Prevention\n            of malaria, preventive treatment, progress, prophylactic\n            treatment, provincial hospitals, public health, public\n            sector health clinics, Quality Assurance, radio, radio\n            spots, radio stations, Regional Cooperation, regional\n            meetings, rehabilitation, reproductive health, respect, risk\n            assessment, rural areas, sanitation, scientific evidence,\n            service delivery, service providers, service provision,\n            service quality, short-term training, sleep, Social\n            Development, Social Marketing, social mobilization, social\n            services, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, symptoms, TB,\n            technical assistance, therapy, treatment of malaria,\n            treatment services, tuberculosis, urban areas, vaccination,\n            vectors, villages, vulnerable groups, Waste, women during\n            pregnancy, workers, working conditions, World Health\n            Organization, young children"}},"owner":"Hlth, Nutr & Pop.
