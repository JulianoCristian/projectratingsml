The lessons learned indicate that overall\n            strong support and ownership from the Borrower during\n            project preparation and implementation contributed to the\n            successful completion of the project. A strong,\n            knowledgeable and well-staffed Project Management Unit (PMU)\n            was required to deal with the complex procurement processes\n            and to meet the demands from participating commercial banks\n            and the World Bank. Legal and regulatory changes have to go\n            hand-in-hand with the introduction of a new banking system\n            so that they can provide timely and consistent legal support\n            and build a legal environment basis for the new banking\n            system to operate effectively. Close supervision by the\n            Bank's task manager ensured that the project's\n            implementation schedule was on track. Clear operational\n            guidelines within the Bank are needed to avoid adverse\n            effects on the supervision and implementation of the project\n            in the client country, particularly when the Bank has to\n            resolve disputes arising from the implementation of its\n            guidelines. Capacity building and institutional development\n            activities that effectively address critical needs of an\n            economy in transition in general and of the banking sector\n            in particular can be sustained with ease beyond the life of\n            the project. Clearer procurement procedures and guidelines\n            help to better address complaints in the procurement\n            process. The need to focus on manpower training will be\n            critical for the successful implementation of these\n            projects. Technical systems such as the IBPS and intrabank\n            payment system require a back-up system. Physical security\n            and integrity of the IBPS and CBPS systems need to be\n            considered as the highest priority to protect the systems.\n            Clear definitions and guidelines regarding verification and\n            acceptance of deliverables as well as billing and payment\n            procedures should be established up front to avoid long\n            payment delays to suppliers and consultants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Payment System and Banking System\n            Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Payment System and\n            Banking System Modernization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/06/4502788/vietnam-payment-system-banking-system-modernization-project","projn":"VN-Banking System Modernization -- P036042","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Intermediation,Information Technology,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040625100437"},"subsc":"Banking,Payments, settlements, and remittance systems","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting framework,accounting\n            systems,ADB,asset management,audits,Automation,bank\n            branches,Bank Performance,Bank supervision,banking\n            sector,banking services,Banking System,banking\n            systems,banks,basic,borrowing,checking,commercial\n            banks,computer hardware,customer services,economic\n            growth,electronic banking,financial reporting,financial\n            strength,financial transactions,FISCAL YEAR,global\n            markets,guidelines,inflation,Informatics,Institutional\n            Development,managers,migration,ministries of Finance,Payment\n            systems,private sector,profitability,regulatory\n            framework,risk management,savings,savings\n            accounts,securities,servers,settlement accounts,settlement\n            systems,stabilization,system design,trading,Transition Economies"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting framework,accounting\n            systems,ADB,asset management,audits,Automation,bank\n            branches,Bank Performance,Bank supervision,banking\n            sector,banking services,Banking System,banking\n            systems,banks,basic,borrowing,checking,commercial\n            banks,computer hardware,customer services,economic\n            growth,electronic banking,financial reporting,financial\n            strength,financial transactions,FISCAL YEAR,global\n            markets,guidelines,inflation,Informatics,Institutional\n            Development,managers,migration,ministries of Finance,Payment\n            systems,private sector,profitability,regulatory\n            framework,risk management,savings,savings\n            accounts,securities,servers,settlement accounts,settlement\n            systems,stabilization,system design,trading,Transition Economies"}},"owner":"Financial & Private Sector Dept.

The immediate objectives of the\n            project are to: 1) improve payment services in the economy\n            in order to reduce float, speed up circulation of funds and\n            increase efficiency of funds transmission, while providing\n            convenience and service to users; and 2) strengthen the\n            institutional capabilities of participating banks in order\n            to stimulate commercial bank initiatives to improve internal\n            management and customer service. The project consists of\n            four components: 1) a national inter-bank payment clearing\n            and settlement system; 2) commercial banks' intra-bank\n            payment systems; 3)

The immediate objectives of the\n            project are to: 1) improve payment services in the economy\n            in order to reduce float, speed up circulation of funds and\n            increase efficiency of funds transmission, while providing\n            convenience and service to users; and 2) strengthen the\n            institutional capabilities of participating banks in order\n            to stimulate commercial bank initiatives to improve internal\n            management and customer service. The project consists of\n            four components: 1) a national inter-bank payment clearing\n            and settlement system; 2) commercial banks' intra-bank\n            payment systems; 3) commercial banks' institutional\n            strengthening;
