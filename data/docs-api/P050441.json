Lessons\n            suggest the following. The project was designed as a\n            Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL), meant to be executed\n            fast, so that outputs could be applied to the rural, and\n            microfinance industry, reapplying lessons to the industry,\n            so as to catalyze further development, seemingly, an\n            ambitious target for a reform-oriented project. A number of\n            activities, such as reviewing and amending laws, involved\n            consensus building among stakeholders which takes a long\n            time. In the end, this project turned out to be like a\n            normal investment project. A LIL was thus not the right\n            instrument to carry out some of the envisaged long term\n            reforms. For a policy-oriented operation, benefits can best\n            suit the industry participants provided close collaboration\n            between the implementing agency, and other stakeholders in\n            the industry occurs. At the preparation stage, the wide\n            collaboration led to a good design, but there was limited\n            collaboration during implementation between the implementing\n            agency and other interested parties, such as within the\n            Government itself, development partners, and umbrella\n            associations, which led to delays and lack of clear channels\n            of communication with the practitioners. The project showed\n            however, that a suitable enabling environment is essential\n            for a sustainable rural and microfinance system. The\n            adoption of the National Microfinance Policy at an early\n            stage, brought order into the Tanzania system, and ensured\n            Government did not get involved in the provision of\n            subsidized, directed microfinance lending, which undermines\n            the operations of microfinance institutions (MFIs). The\n            project did raise the profile of rural and microfinance in\n            Tanzania, and attracted a number of development partners\n            into the sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania -
