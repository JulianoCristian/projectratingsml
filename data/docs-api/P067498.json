The strategic context calls for macroeconomic\n            stability, improved private sector development, and\n            alleviation of infrastructure bottlenecks, and it is within\n            this context that the project will ensure adequate\n            functioning of those sectors. The project time frame will be\n            split in four phases, to include the following components:\n            1) Project management will be strengthened, to cover overall\n            supervision requirements, including weekly reporting to the\n            Ministry of Scientific Research and Technology. This\n            component include action priority selection, budget issues,\n            and, training to increase awareness on Y2K risks. 2) Public\n            sector systems, will cover the operation of critical\n            information systems, managed by main administrative centers,\n            public administration offices, state-owned enterprises, and,\n            health facilities, including medical instruments. 3) Time\n            constraints will hinder the readiness of all systems by\n            December 31, 1999, hence, contingency plans will: a)\n            globally target severe impacts on infrastructure, and, b)\n            target sector-specific administrative functioning, to\n            minimize potential adversities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Year 2000 National Action Plan\n            Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal - Year 2000 National\n            Action Plan Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/10/439825/senegal-year-2000-national-action-plan-support-project","projn":"SN-Public Serv.
