Some lessons learned\n            included: unencumbered plantation sites should be clearly\n            identified at appraisal, and the first year's\n            plantation areas should already be demarcated before project\n            commencement in order to expedite plantation implementation.\n            Relocation and resettlement activities should not commence\n            before preparing adequate resettlement plans. Establishing\n            state plantations in densely populated areas is likely to\n            lead to low survival rates. However, the risk of failure is\n            greater if farmers are evicted to give way to plantations. A\n            separate project management structure (without an adequate\n            coordinating mechanism in place), may lead to its\n            institutional isolation from the established technical and\n            administrative bodies, hence reducing its effectiveness. It\n            should be ensured that project covenants are either complied\n            with, or formally excluded if they are unattainable. An\n            enhanced monitoring capability should be designed for\n            projects with environmental and natural resource\n            conservation components that not only reviews physical\n            achievements, but also assesses the environmental impact of\n            the project through key indicators and studies and baseline surveys."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -
