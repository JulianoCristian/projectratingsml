Both the Bank, and\n            Borrower's performances were satisfactory, having\n            improved the quality, efficiency, and relevancy of education\n            significantly at the basic education level, and, overall\n            management capacity was strengthened. However, the National\n            University of Lesotho still faces management problems, and,\n            the project's financial objectives were negligible. The\n            key lessons indicate that: 1) although cooperation from\n            external assistance agencies, do provide the leverage and\n            coordination needed for project implementation which may be\n            politically sensitive, coordination changes in donor funding\n            may adversely impact implementation; 2) although\n            theoretically, development projects integrate sectoral\n            planning, this mere assumption fails to forge the needed\n            active linkages. However, the sectoral approach in this\n            case, was effective due to a continuous management by the\n            Planning Unit, along with that of assistance agencies,\n            particularly the Bank's; 3) development efforts are\n            difficult in nature, thus governments should support key\n            components in the development process, particularly\n            planning, and financial issues. In turn, the Bank should\n            play an active role within the supervision process, to\n            assist governments in meeting project objectives, through\n            interaction, and external consultation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Education Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho - Education Sector\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/01/728702/lesotho-education-sector-development-project","projn":"LS-Educ.
