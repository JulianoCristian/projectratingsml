It would include: (i) nickel exploration;\n            (ii) trial peat production; (iii) engineering studies (high\n            grade mineability, hydroelectric site, sulfur sources, and\n            process selection); (iv) overall review of the Musongati\n            Project viability; and (v) management assistance. The\n            proposed Credit is considered as the minimum investment\n            required to bring the Musongati Project to a point where\n            both the Government and potential investors can make\n            informed decisions regarding the Project's viability,\n            including whether or not to proceed with a full feasibility\n            study.
