The main objectives of the project were: (i) to\n            support stabilization efforts, while maintaining the\n            momentum of price liberalization and the progressive opening\n            of the economy; and (ii) to further structural reforms and\n            to expand private ownership.  Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) political\n            commitment and the early assumption of ownership by the\n            implementing Government has been key to success; (ii) the\n            change in government necessitated a substantial investment\n            by the Bank in consultation and supervision; (iii) the SAL\n            was ambitious, comprehensive and complex; (iv) the central\n            importance of early macroeconomic stabilization emerges as a\n            key lessonof the SAL; (v) the SAL supported privatization\n            and achieved its specific agreements in this regard; (v)\n            allowing large loss making-enterprisest o go bankrupt has\n            proven extremely
