In (sub)\n            sector reform project more detailed standards for measuring\n            school performance in terms of quality of learning and\n            teaching, and of the overall performance of the school,\n            should be developed. More attention should be given in the\n            Bank's project preparation process to the need for\n            sustainability after project closure. Project that aim to\n            improve the quality of learning and teaching at primary and\n            or secondary levels should define: to have a realistic\n            lead-time and sufficiently-detailed indicator for\n            \"quality of learning and teaching effects\" to\n            emerge and that are measurable, and can (preferably) be\n            \"cross-checked\" against other pedagogic\n            indicators.
