The project's overall outcome is rated\n            satisfactory. Key lessons learned from this project are: 1)\n            Rapid reconstruction has medium term cost in terms of\n            delayed policy and institutional reform. 2) Better\n            communication and coordination among donors and different\n            levels of government is essential within the Federation and\n            between entities. 3) Reconstruction in many areas cannot\n            proceed effectively without progress in addressing key\n            policy issues in the sector. 4) It will take time before\n            parties to the conflict accept the role education must play\n            in promoting reconciliation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bosnia and Herzegovina -
