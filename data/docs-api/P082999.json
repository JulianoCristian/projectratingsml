Some lessons learned includes:\n            timing of education reform. It is always a challenge to find\n            the best possible synchronization between planned project\n            implementation plans and the national 'rhythm' in\n            creating the conditions for education reform. A separate\n            political consensus process is needed, after reforms are\n            ready, to explicitly address political sensitivities and\n            develop political ownership. Technical and professional\n            consultations on reforms are necessary but not sufficient.\n            Clarity of monitoring and evaluation (M and E) roles and\n            linkages of M and E to policy development should be ensured.\n            The Bank should provide a clear design and continuous\n            technical support on the M&E practice. Capacity\n            building. Knowledge of Bank procedures cannot be\n            underestimated when looking at elements of success of an\n            investment project. Training on Bank operations is necessary\n            for counterpart staff and critical for new staff, and this\n            applies to procurement as well as financial management.\n            Raising learning outcomes in disadvantaged areas is a\n            challenge that developed and developing countries face\n            nowadays in a context of nearly universal primary and\n            secondary education. Project implementation and procurement.\n            Procurement delays were due to several factors some inherent\n            to the country procurement system and procedures and some\n            due to the capacity and skills in the implementing agency.\n            School rehabilitation: many cases where rehabilitation was\n            required were due to the lack of proper maintenance over\n            long periods of time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Second Phase of the Education\n            Quality Improvement Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia -

objectives of the Second Phase of\n            the Education Quality Improvement Project for Tunisia are to\n            assist the Borrower in reinforcing the process of reforming\n            its education sector through: (a) promoting excellence in\n            teaching and learning in an improved pedagogical and\n            physical environment; and (b) ensuring that all children are\n            provided with equitable and adequate opportunities to access\n            quality education at all levels of the Borrower's\n            school system. These changes will enable the Government to\n            complete remaining activities which cannot be completed\n            prior to the project's current closing date, and make\n            use of cost savings for additional rehabilitation works for\n            schools, purchase of income tax (IT) equipment and conduct\n            the relevant teacher training. Cost savings come from\n            savings on IT equipment purchases and appreciation of the\n            Euro in which the loan is denominated. The reallocation does\n            not imply changes in the components of the project, nor in\n            the activities to be carried out by the project. The school\n            rehabilitation has been an important part of component D of\n            the project (strengthening core system), and up until now,\n            1325 schools have been rehabilitated. This second extension\n            and reallocation of funds would allow the Government to\n            continue with the school rehabilitation, following the needs\n            assessment done on a yearly basis by the direction of\n            buildings and equipment. This will be supported through the\n            use of cost savings. The extension of the project closing\n            date will also allow the Government to complete the\n            procurement and distribution of IT equipment, and fully\n            execute a number of consultant contracts that will assist\n            the Ministry of Education in getting the best use of the IT\n            infrastructure procured by the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -

Along the same lines,\n            in order to fully implement the language program in schools,\n            the equipment of language labs at the school level was\n            deemed necessary."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -
