Some lessons\n            learned included: early engagement of the user community\n            during the preparation of the pilot projects had a\n            significant and positive effect on the execution of the\n            pilot scale activities. This participation served to\n            maintain the visibility of the projects from the government\n            perspective and their early inputs aided in the design and\n            execution of effective pilot designs. This was particularly\n            effective in the case of the Bequia desalination plant and\n            the irrigation works in Dominica. In the pilot rainwater\n            harvesting effort on St. Lucia, the identification and\n            engagement of a motivated private sector partner was\n            critical to the success of the demonstration project. Hotel\n            participation was robust and their contribution both in\n            support for the pilot as well as their willingness to engage\n            other hotel owners provided for the successful\n            implementation of the conservation strategy, and turned into\n            a vehicle for educating others in the hotel sector about the\n            benefits of rain-water harvesting. Saint Lucia has used both\n            pilots to shape regulations and include new requirements\n            when building infrastructure in the country. The experience\n            they have gained through Special Program for Adaptation to\n            Climate Change (SPACC) has been critical in informing the\n            higher level decisions that have been taken; Saint Vincent\n            has also used the experience gained with SPACC to promote\n            solar energy in the island and gain insights on how to make\n            this process more efficient, and they have started the\n            supply of fresh water to the Grenadines. One of the lessons\n            they have extracted is the necessity to have clear\n            regulation on power purchase agreements for the electricity\n            utility to buy energy off from private producers. In\n            Dominica, the irrigation pilot has generated lessons on how\n            to implement infrastructure for a community of water users,\n            since this has been one of the first projects of its kind\n            developed by the Agriculture Ministry in consultation with\n            communities. Although SPACC is a regional project, there are\n            lessons from adaptation to each national context and\n            dissemination to the wider Caribbean. As such, a lesson\n            learnt is the need to provide more funding and efforts\n            towards knowledge management of the activities performed,\n            and a coherent, integrated monitoring system with\n            appropriate funding."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Caribbean -

These adaptation measures will address\n            the impacts of climate change on the natural resource base\n            of the region, focused on biodiversity and land degradation\n            along coastal and near-coastal areas.

Mitigation measures include: a) the water intake\n            will be submerged to 7m below the surface and is therefore\n            not expected to interfere with commercial and leisure\n            navigation;  b) prior consent from land-holders must be\n            obtained before accessing private property; c) excavation\n            surveys and analysis was conducted as required with the\n            results indicating that the site was in fact suitable for\n            construction of the 90,000 liters capacity tank recommended\n            for water storage; d) the salinity increase caused by plant\n            discharges can effectively be alleviated by pre?dilution\n            with other wastewater streams. However, the discharge\n            location has generally good mixing characteristics due to\n            strong wave action and currents. Hence, dispersion should be\n            rapid and impacts minimal even without pre-dilution; and e)\n            quality control procedures and personnel training shall be\n            implemented to

efforts of\n            Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to\n            implement specific, integrated pilot adaptation measures\n            that primarily address the impacts of climate change on\n            their natural resource base, with a focus on biodiversity\n            and land degradation along coastal and near-coastal\n            areas.' The main reasons for the restructuring are:\n            first, it is proposed to scale down the component and remove\n            two of the three pilots in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\n            This change results in a reduction of two pilot activities\n            out of the initial seven. The main reasons for the\n            government's decision not to implement the two pilots\n            are: (a) the high anthropological pressure on aquifers and\n            surface waters, increased by a generalized water scarcity\n            situation; and (b) the two other pilots have effectively\n            stalled due to land related issues. No portion of the Global\n            Environment Facility (GEF) grant has been used to finance\n            these two pilots. Second, there is a need to adjust the\n            project's outcome indicators to better reflect the\n            nature of the interventions. Intermediate outcome indicators\n            will also be changed accordingly.

The project also seeks to produce\n            knowledge o f global value on how to implement adaptation\n            measures in small island states that can be applied in other\n            countries in the region, not participating in the project\n            and even for islands in other regions o f the world. The\n            project would support four components, three of which will\n            be prioritized in national adaptation strategies and refined\n            through a series of regional and national consultations:\n            Component one identifies, evaluates, selects and designs\n            priority adaptation measures addressing impacts of climate\n            change on biodiversity and land degradation. Component two\n            implements selected adaptation measures designed to address\n            climate impacts on biodiversity and land degradation.
