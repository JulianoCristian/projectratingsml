It is estimated that\n            2000 farmers would require credit for an average of 4 ha of\n            citrus development each. Farm size in the area is about 10\n            ha and the project would encourage diversity in cropping\n            patterns. A typical sub-loan would amount to US$1800 per ha\n            and the farmer would contribute about US$360 per ha for\n            which his own labor could qualify."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Fruit and Vegetable Export Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Turkey - Fruit and Vegetable\n            Export Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1971/05/1556304/turkey-fruit-vegetable-export-project","projn":"TR-Vegetable Farming -- P008890","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Turkey","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Middle East!$!80463"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101903184577"},"subsc":"(Historic)Annual crops","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural credit,Agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank loans,banking\n            system,Borrower,borrowing,Central Bank,Commitment,Commitment\n            Charge,consumer price index,Current\n            expenditures,Debt,deposits,devaluation,DEVELOPMENT\n            CREDIT,economic activity,economic performance,Economic\n            Relations,exchange rate,exports,Financial\n            institutions,foreign exchange,forestry,GNP,GNP per\n            capita,Gross National Product,growth rate,Housing,IDA\n            credit,IDA credits,Interest Rate,Investment\n            expenditures,LOAN,Loan Agreement,LOAN CREDIT,loan\n            disbursements,manufacturers,market prices,money\n            supply,NDP,Net imports,Private consumption,Public\n            Debt,Public Finance,quality\n            standards,Relending,savings,Subsidiary,Subsidiary Loan\n            Agreement,tax revenue,technical\n            assistance,transport,wholesale price index"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural credit,Agriculture,balance of\n            payments,Bank loans,banking\n            system,Borrower,borrowing,Central Bank,Commitment,Commitment\n            Charge,consumer price index,Current\n            expenditures,Debt,deposits,devaluation,DEVELOPMENT\n            CREDIT,economic activity,economic performance,Economic\n            Relations,exchange rate,exports,Financial\n            institutions,foreign exchange,forestry,GNP,GNP per\n            capita,Gross National Product,growth rate,Housing,IDA\n            credit,IDA credits,Interest Rate,Investment\n            expenditures,LOAN,Loan Agreement,LOAN CREDIT,loan\n            disbursements,manufacturers,market prices,money\n            supply,NDP,Net imports,Private consumption,Public\n            Debt,Public Finance,quality\n            standards,Relending,savings,Subsidiary,Subsidiary Loan\n            Agreement,tax revenue,technical\n            assistance,transport,wholesale price index"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"1":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"2":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"3":{"geo_region":"Middle East"},"4":{"geo_region":"Middle East"}},"repnb":"P948"},"facets":{}}}
