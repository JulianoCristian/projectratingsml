The\n            World Bank task team has reviewed the proposed action plan\n            and has found it to be satisfactory. The action plan and\n            implementation timeline are available in project files. This\n            will be the first extension of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Geothermal Power\n            Generation Development Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/06/14480195/indonesia-geothermal-power-generation-development-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"ID-Geothermal Power Generation Development\n            -- P099757","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Renewable Energy,Energy Production and Transportation,Housing & Human Habitats,Power & Energy Conversion,E-Business","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20110629000302"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Renewable energy,Power","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Energy,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"Global Environment Project","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Action Plan, availability, Capacity\n            Building, Carbon dioxide, CO2 emissions, Coal, development\n            status, emissions, Energy Conservation, energy sector,\n            financial management, financial reports, GEOTHERMAL,\n            geothermal capacity, Geothermal Energy, GEOTHERMAL POWER,\n            geothermal resource, Geothermal Sector, Mineral Resources,\n            Policy Framework, power company, POWER GENERATION, power\n            generation expansion, power purchase agreements, power\n            system, procurement, procurement process, Project\n            Management, Renewable Energy, result, Supervision, transaction"}},"owner":"Indonesia Sustainable Devlpmnt (EASIS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Technical Assistance Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF092324-GEF FSP - INDONESIA: GEOTHERMAL\n            POWER GENERATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","repnb":"62983"},"9443765":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/05/9443765/indonesia-geothermal-power-generation-development-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2008/05/9443765/indonesia-geothermal-power-generation-development-project","new_url":"2008/05/9443765/indonesia-geothermal-power-generation-development-project","disclosure_date":"2008-07-08T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/05/14/000333037_20080514235757/Rendered/INDEX/414200PAD0P09910810011110Box327374B.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2008/05/14/000333037_20080514235757/Rendered/PDF/414200PAD0P09910810011110Box327374B.pdf","docdt":"2008-05-01T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2008-05-14T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Geothermal Power Generation\n            Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Geothermal Power\n            Generation Development Project is to promote the expansion\n            of economic and environmentally friendly geothermal power\n            generation in Indonesia, and to reduce Carbon dioxide (CO2)\n            emissions from the power system. There are four components\n            to the project. The first component is the policy framework\n            for scaling-up the development of geothermal power. This\n            component will assist the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in\n            developing and implementing an integrated set of policies\n            that will provide sufficient regulatory certainty, risk\n            mitigation, and economic incentives for increased public and\n            private investments toward developing geothermal power in\n            Indonesia. The second component is the transactions\n            management for mobilizing investments in geothermal power\n            generation. This component will assist the GoI, especially\n            the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), to\n            develop the capacity for planning and transacting geothermal\n            power developments in an efficient and transparent manner.\n            The third component is the geothermal sector technical\n            capacity building. This component will help address the\n            limited domestic technical capacity for handling most\n            geothermal related activities, and support the long-term\n            development prospects of the sector. Finally, the fourth\n            component is the project management assistance. This\n            component will provide the necessary technical consultant\n            support to the directorate of geothermal enterprise\n            supervision and ground water management, the executive\n            implementation unit, for the management and supervision of\n            the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
