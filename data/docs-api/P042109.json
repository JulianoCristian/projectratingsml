Some lessons learned included: the Bank\n            should adopt a flexible approach to the institutional model\n            for the sector, and in particular consider the country\n            conditions, instead of advocating the traditional utility\n            model as the default option. The arrangements in place in\n            Beijing assure sustainable service provision, which rely on\n            a combination of politically feasible tariffs and regular\n            confirmed resource transfers from the municipal government.\n            However, such an arrangement is only feasible where the city\n            can: (i) ensure service provision at low cost; (ii) take on\n            responsibility for servicing debt; and (iii) provide timely\n            cash transfers to meet shortfalls, especially in relation to\n            new investments. Water re-use in water scarce areas is sound\n            policy. Beijing has performed well to achieve a 50 percent\n            rate of water reuse, by addressing the key issues relating\n            to water re-use: (i) reclaimed water quality and\n            reliability; (ii) price of reclaimed water; and (iii) cost\n            and benefit of using water supplied through the system and\n            reclaimed water. This should serve as an example for other\n            Chinese cities. The boiler conversion program faced not only\n            major technical, environmental and economic issues, but also\n            significant coordination and political issues. The ambitious\n            targets set for conversion to natural gas-fired boilers were\n            only achieved (albeit mostly outside the project) because of\n            strong leadership, both at central and municipal government\n            levels. In areas involving significant commercial operations\n            (such as boiler conversions), newly established municipal\n            entities with no commercial expertise are not likely to\n            succeed. It might have been more appropriate for the\n            government to have partnered with a truly commercial\n            company, or the boiler conversions might have been left\n            entirely to market forces with some incentives to end-users."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Second Beijing Environment Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Second Beijing\n            Environment

Boiler Market and Technology\n            Development component will support activities to develop\n            industry-wide technical capacity, remove market information\n            gaps, facilitate and aggregate market demands, reduce excess\n            costs incurred by early converters, and structurally reduce\n            the costs of gas boiler equipment and services. 3) The\n            Heating Energy Conservation component will support the\n            establishment of the technical and institutional basis to\n            encourage sustained market-based energy conservation in\n            various elements of the heating systems. 4) The Air Quality\n            Monitoring and Decision Support System Improvement component\n            will upgrade and renovate the

     and its implementation support and training. 9) The Land\n            Acquisition and Resettlement component will finance the\n            compensation provided to the people and entities
