Some lessons learned included: the\n            project implementation unit (PIU) at Corporacion Dominicana\n            de Empresas Electricas y Estatales (CDEEE) learned that is\n            necessary to reduce the scope of bidding processes (or to\n            set a cap on the maximum number of areas that a single\n            company can win) to increase the number of participating\n            contractors and reduce the risk of no delivery; without this\n            provision very large companies tend to win the bids\n            increasing the project's vulnerability to delays and\n            low quality of service. The basic and design engineering\n            have to be conducted when the resources are available to pay\n            for the rehabilitation works, considering that long delays\n            in the project (including in reaching effectiveness and in\n            the launching of bidding process) render the engineering\n            work outdated as the system changes with demand growth and\n            other modifications. The choice of cash recovery index (CRI)\n            as an indicator that reflects progress in the financial\n            sustainability of distribution companies was not necessarily\n            appropriate in the context of the power sector in the DR.\n            Empresas Distribuidoras de Electricidad (EDEs) financial\n            sustainability is affected by a number of other variables\n            including the debt service associated with the loans issued\n            to purchase fuel oil and direct cash transfers from the\n            government to cover this debt. Lessons learned in monitoring\n            and evaluation (M and E) is the need to impose third audit\n            access of EDEs' primary data as condition for\n            concessionary support to ensure the quality of M and E\n            results. The PIU has learned that it is important to include\n            the installation of meters and other accessories (commercial\n            infrastructure) in the works associated with the\n            rehabilitation of circuits to avoid delays in service\n            provision and the regularization of billing. The design of\n            the social component, which included a strong social\n            management plan that introduced a seven step process as a\n            strategy for community outreach was extremely successful in\n            both bringing the community on board and substantially\n            improving the revenue collection of the utilities as well as\n            quality of service to

three electricity distribution companies, and\n            (b) improve the quality of electricity service. The closing\n            date for the Project will be extended from December 31, 2012\n            until June 30, 2013. The Project Management, development\n            objectives and implementation progress are rated\n            satisfactory through July 2, 2012. To date, 69 percent of\n            the Loan has been disbursed and the three main procurement\n            contracts, for a total of US$37 million are being\n            implemented.
