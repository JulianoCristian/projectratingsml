Some\n            lessons learned includes: setting a counterpart share needs\n            to be realistic for a country coming out of conflict. The 50\n            percent counterpart share in Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF),\n            although agreed by the Government, was unprecedentedly high.\n            This became evident when the Government defaulted on its\n            commitments resulting in many implementation delays\n            throughout the MDTF portfolio. Close interaction and\n            engagement with local authorities is essential from the\n            outset. The Bank should broaden its engagement beyond its\n            official counterpart, the Ministry of Finance. Bank\n            engagement with the state government once the project faced\n            counterpart funding issues proved successful and suggests\n            closer dialogue on a regular basis. A better risk assessment\n            is required in fragile settings, but this must translate\n            into more appropriate project design. It is not sufficient\n            to provide a good assessment of risks, as was done in the\n            project, but the risk assessment needs to inform project\n            design. Resolving the tension and trade-offs between the\n            need to act quickly to stabilize conflict affected\n            populations and longer-term capacity development objectives.\n            Where there is an inherent tension between the need to\n            respond quickly, as in an emergency operation, and the need\n            to build local capacity, project design needs to acknowledge\n            this tension, the potential trade-offs and ways in which\n            these can be resolved during project implementation. Better\n            institutional arrangements and government involvement in\n            overall project coordination when components are implemented\n            by different agencies, especially if they are national and\n            international. Even where there is a need to act quickly,\n            there is a need to ensure some level of stakeholder\n            involvement and consultations, which can be deepened as the\n            project is implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan - South Kordofan State Emergency Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Sudan - South Kordofan State\n            Emergency
