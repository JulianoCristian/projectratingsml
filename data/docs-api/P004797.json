Although the lessons\n            learned from this project, are no different than many other\n            projects, in that government commitment and ownership is\n            paramount for success, risk mitigation should be pursued,\n            and, efficient and consistent teams are advantageous during\n            project cycle, some major lessons are brought under\n            consideration: 1) Despite the existing rule for\n            pre-qualification of bidders, it is important to reiterate\n            the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, even when financing\n            is provided through non-Bank funds. This would ensure\n            governments of the soundness of the various prospective\n            contractors. 2) The outcome of projects is particularly\n            based on the quality and firmness of supervision, which\n            pursues compliance with covenants. It was this persistence\n            which successfully brought to conclusion a delayed\n            Corporatization/Privatization study, a basic document in the\n            far reaching organizational and strategic reform of the\n            Petroleum Authority of Thailand. 3) The pace of reforms\n            should largely be left to the borrower's judgement, for\n            it is the incremental, sequential, and steady approaches\n            which provide a sustainable likelihood. Much of the project\n            success was due to mutual trust between the Bank and the Borrower."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Second Gas Transmission

As such, the project will help the Petroleum\n            Authority of Thailand (PTT) to: 1) move toward a fully\n            commercial operation under the new organization, as well as\n            continue previous efforts to strengthen its institutional\n            capacity to apply safety and environmental standards and\n            conduct project analyses including investment programming\n            and 2) construct a pipeline for transporting domestic gas.\n            The project components include: 1) a comprehensive study\n            regarding PTT corporate strategy, organizational\n            effectiveness, and ownership structure; 2) institutional\n            building and training of PTT staff; 3) a 36-inch diameter,\n            425 km offshore gas transmission pipeline that extends from\n            an existing platform at the Erawan fields in the  Gulf of\n            Thailand to onshore receiving facilities at Rayong; 4) a\n            28-inch diameter, 110 km onshore pipeline that extends from\n            Rayong to an area near the EGAT power plant at Bang Pakong;\n            5) related facilities, including a compressor

for\n            Thailand.  The project consists of supply and construction\n            of a gas transmission system including related ancillary\n            facilities.  The potential soil erosion and terrestrial\n            ecology impact can be mitigated by a minimization of the\n            clearing area and backfilling and replacement of groundcover\n            after pipeline burial.  The marine water quality and the\n            aquatic biology may be affected by sea bottom disturbance,\n            waste disposal, chemical discharge from the hydrostatic\n            test, and gas leakage from the pipeline.  These can be\n            mitigated by the selection of spoil areas for trenching,\n            placing gravel at spans, prohibition of waste dumping,\n            provision of onboard waste receptacles, the use of proper\n            hydrostatic test chemicals, and the installation of on-line\n            gas leakage and pressure change detection systems.  The\n            public health/safety impacts during construction come from\n            possible health problems and accidents, living conditions in\n            the construction camps, and possible gas leakage.  These are\n            mitigated by the provision of proper health and\n            environmental sanitation, adequate safety devices, and\n            stringent regulations combined with comprehensive training\n            programs.  The anticipated impacts are mostly short term and\n            relatively minor.
