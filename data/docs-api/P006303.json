The\n            overall objectives of both projects included: increasing\n            productivity and incomes; broadening employment\n            opportunities and generally improving the standard of living\n            of farm families and small-scale non-agricultural\n            enterprises; and increasing agriculture and rural industry\n            production for local and export markets; and improving\n            physical and social infrastructure. The Main lessons drawn\n            from the projects are: (a) the size and scope/complexity of\n            a project needs to be matched to existing institutional\n            capacities and to the available financial resources; (b) the\n            political, sociological and technical constraints to\n            facilitate changes, both in the effectiveness of public\n            sector institutions, as well as in behavior of\n            beneficiaries, need to be realistically assessed; (c)\n            success of investment projects depends critically on\n            availability of viable , agricultural technologies and, in\n            the case of small farmers, of credit; (d) successful land\n            distribution is a multi-faceted issue which cannot be\n            handled effectively as a minor project component, especially\n            in a politically volatile environment; (e) successful\n            project design and implementation requires the participation\n            of beneficiaries in project preparation; and (f) Bank\n            supervision needs to: (i) reinforce suitable impact\n            evaluation procedures including the establishment of\n            baseline data; and (ii) pay sufficient attention to\n            technical aspects of project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
