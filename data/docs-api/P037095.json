Other factors\n            affecting implementation were that inherent complexities in\n            the geographic setting, logistical framework, institutional\n            capacity, and project design provided a formidable challenge\n            to management at the outset. In terms of the physical,\n            financial, and human resources capacity alone, the\n            management workload aspects were underestimated and caused\n            immediate deficiencies in project performance. The project\n            never achieved a level of sustainable or effective momemtum,\n            and would have needed intensive professional support to\n            off-set low implementation capacity. Among the lessons to be\n            learned are that 1) Complex projects with geographically\n            dispersed characteristics could be more successfully\n            implemented at a more decentralized level; 2) Project\n            management and supervision decisions taken by the Bank and\n            clients require corporate continuity and consistency in\n            approach to assist project performance while allowing for a\n            transition to full implementation momentum; and 3)\n            Post-conflict reviews and/or assessments of needs and sector\n            rehabilitation potential would provide longer term planning\n            benefit to the client and the Bank for loan projects closed\n            due to civil unrest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Maluku Regional Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Maluku Regional\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1551917/indonesia-maluku-regional-development-project","projn":"ID-Maluku Reg.

This project has five components. The first expands,\n            intensifies, and rehabilitates tree crops on land owned by\n            low income households. It procures seed stock; trains farmer\n            seed growers on nursery methods for tree crops; trains\n            farmers in controlling coconut and coffee diseases and pests\n            and in intercropping techniques; and trains staff in disease\n            and pest control, farming systems development and extension\n            methods, management information systems, and other\n            specialized areas. The second component comprises community\n            development for infrastructure and income generation,\n            focusing on agricultural production, post-harvesting\n            processing, fisheries-related activities, and women's\n            income-earning activities. It trains facilitators to assist\n            community participants in planning, developing and\n            implementing proposals.

The\n            fourth component improves docks for sea transportation and\n            on-shore (storage) facilities.
