Experience\n            with the assessed projects confirms a number of lessons: 1)\n            A policy framework focused on costs and access is\n            insufficient. The two primary education projects emphasized\n            cost savings over instruction on basic skills. Policy\n            dialogue and project activities need to focus on student\n            acquisition of basic skills. Providing mass education under\n            clearly inadequate instructional conditions may graduate\n            functional illiterates, and benefit only those who are the\n            brightest, or better-off. 2) Access-related indicators may\n            be relatively easy to obtain, but may not be closely related\n            to learning achievements. Monitoring indicators for the two\n            primary education projects showcased enrollment increases\n            and improvements in student flows, but not whether students\n            had acquired basic knowledge and skills. Innovative and\n            rapid means must be sought to gauge students'\n            achievements (such as the proportion of students able to\n            read fluently a simple text.). Procurement planning must aim\n            at making large numbers of textbooks available to students\n            for free, but also available for sale at the market.\n            Textbook management is most effective if it takes into\n            account the printing strengths of the local private sector,\n            and the community school associations. Though in other\n            countries enrollments in agricultural schools tend to be low\n            and labor linkages weak, in Niger there is a demand for the\n            skills provided. Bank investments of earlier decades in\n            agricultural education may continue to provide skills\n            relevant to the economy, if policy dialogue is focused\n            toward modernizing courses, generating income to schools,\n            and catering to the populations likely to be interested in\n            agricultural training."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger -

- Basic Education Sector Project (Hybrid)"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Niger is one of the five countries in\n            the world that have less than one-third of their children\n            enrolled in primary education.  Although primary school\n            enrollment increased by 73% between 1980 and 1993, due to\n            high population growth, the enrollment coverage in 1993 was\n            only marginally higher than in 1980.  The Government has\n            developed an Emergency Education Rehabilitation Plan (EERP),\n            designed to initiate a transformation of Niger's\n            education system from a small, elitist and costly system\n            into one that is more relevant and equitable.  The project\n            will support implementation of EERP between 1994 and 1999\n            with the objective of increasing the primary school\n            enrollment ratio from 29% to 35%.  The project will achieve\n            this objective by implementing a sector reform program\n            designed to: 1) increase public expenditures on primary\n            education; 2) extend the use of double-shift teaching in\n            primary education; 3) restructure and consolidate training\n            of primary school teachers; 4) consolidate training of\n            secondary school teachers; 5) use teachers more efficiently;\n            and 5) contain student subsidies in secondary and higher\n            education.  The project will also improve access to quality\n            of primary education by constructing classrooms; providing\n            school textbooks; developing and implementing a program to\n            accelerate girl's education; and improving teacher\n            training programs. Finally, the project will strengthen\n            sector managerial and planning capacities by: strengthening\n            the capacity of the Ministry of Education to manage\n            education resources and implement and evaluate education\n            improvement programs; improving the efficiency of\n            decentralized sector planning and management; and preparing\n            a development strategy for higher education."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Basic Education Sector Project (Hybrid)"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Basic Education Sector\n            Project
