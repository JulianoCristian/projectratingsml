The main economic benefits of the project\n            would take the form of lower vehicle operating costs, user\n            time savings and the increased rate of agriculture\n            development induced by the improved infrastructure. The\n            estimated economic rate of return on the project as a whole\n            is about 20 per cent."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Fifth Highway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya -
