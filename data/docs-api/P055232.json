Some lessons learned included:\n            this project was designed as the first phase of an Adaptable\n            Program Loans (APLs). APLs support a long term vision and\n            depend on the compliance of agreed triggers linked to the\n            medium term sector policies. This instrument is relevant\n            when institutions are strong and have a track record of\n            consistency for a period of time that goes beyond that\n            expected for the project itself. While this project was\n            designed during a period when the Ministry of Education had\n            shown continuity in its policies, the frequent changes in\n            Ministers and the subsequent changes in vision were not\n            foreseen. Thus, this type of lending instrument was not\n            appropriate for such a highly uncertain context where the\n            continuity of the sector policy framework was not in place.\n            In such cases, selecting a sector investment loan might have\n            been more effective. Political support is linked to\n            decision-making about human and financial resources\n            allocation to ensure adequate implementation of a project.\n            In the case of this project, the frequent changes in\n            ministers (there were six different Ministers, whose average\n            tenure, was about one year) and the consequent changes of\n            Directors and Project Managers, resulted in reduced\n            ownership of the project and changes in priorities. As a\n            result, the higher levels of the Ministry did not prioritize\n            the project and human resource allocation weakened with\n            time. Even though the Bank team discussed the project with\n            all new incoming teams, the vision of improving rural\n            education was lost for other priorities brought by the new\n            administrations. Thus, political risk is critical for\n            project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Rural Education Project in Support of\n            the First Phase of the Rural Education

The project components are as follows. The first\n            component will increase access to, and quality of initial,\n            pre-school, and secondary education for children in rural\n            areas. Initial, and pre-school education will have a\n            non-formal approach to education, focused not only on\n            children, but on parents and siblings within a family, and\n            community framework. Trained community educators, fluent in\n            the local languages will provide initial education, and,\n            interventions combining formal, and non-formal approaches\n            will follow for pre-school, which includes the introduction\n            to the Spanish language. Distance secondary education will\n            be developed (in addition to traditional school delivery)\n            through cost-effective information and communication\n            technologies, and teacher training assistance. The second\n            component focuses on the quality of teaching, and learning\n            in primary schools in the targeted rural areas, supporting\n            continuous professional development focused on rural\n            teachers, developing, and distributing multi-grade, and\n            bilingual instruction materials, and, rehabilitating\n            classrooms.

Following a review of the\n            country's legal framework, which specifies the rights\n            of indigenous people as included in the Constitution, the\n            General Education Act, the Primary Education Regulations,\n            and recent regulations created by the National\n            Inter-Cultural Bilingual Education Directorate, measures are\n            hereby identified, specifically on inter-cultural bilingual\n            education. Teaching materials for inter-cultural bilingual\n            education are a substantive component of the strategy, and,\n            student education materials will be distributed, including\n            textbooks for language and mathematics. Alternative\n            materials for multi-grade, and single teacher classrooms\n            will also be prepared, as will educational modules for\n            preschool education from a self-paced perspective, using\n            indigenous languages as primary, with Spanish as secondary\n            language. Participatory approaches will involve regional\n            teams, including indigenous peoples, whose dynamic should\n            facilitate the internal, and external review processes.\n            Validation and completion of textbook production, will be\n            followed by adjustments, and reprinting as needed. Classroom\n            libraries will be gradually established for early childhood\n            bilingual education, in three languages: Quechua, Aymara,\n            and Aguaruna, and, by 2005 in three additional languages:\n            Shipibo, Chayahuita, and Ashaninka. A curriculum proposal\n            will be prepared, and introduced related to the needs, and\n            demands as identified during consultations among bilingual\n            people, followed by
