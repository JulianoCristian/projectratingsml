Lessons learned from this assessment included:\n            the drive to accelerate disbursements and to spread the\n            financing across a wide range of implementers, activities\n            and geographic areas poses the risk that these process goals\n            could take precedence over the quality of interventions, as\n            well as the strategic selection and prioritization of the\n            highest-impact activities; a more strategic choice and\n            sustained use of implementers with the experience and\n            capacity to carry out the highest impact interventions\n            likely would have resulted in stronger and more sustainable\n            results; efforts to strengthen a multi-sectoral response\n            would likely have been more successful had synergies been\n            created with the Ministry of Health, capitalizing on\n            technical and operational expertise; and learning-by-doing\n            has the potential

Lessons learned from the\n            project: The use of HIV prevalence data, though an excellent\n            monitoring tool for the epidemic in countries, should not be\n            a measure of success of a Bank funded HIV/AIDS project. The\n            decision to design the project without and Ministry of\n            Health component was not appropriate. Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS\n            in the formal education sector was effective for\n            comprehensive targeting of at-risk youth who reported\n            reduction in number of partners and increased use of\n            condoms. Contracting out an international auditor to assess\n            the use of funds by civil society organizations contributed\n            to a balance between implementation facilitation and\n            fiduciary responsibility. Decentralization of HIV/AIDS\n            response is very successful in Ghana as demonstrated by the\n            strong ownership of GARFUND by provinces and districts.\n            Development Partner collaboration and co-financing was\n            successful and should be promoted and expanded. An effective\n            monitoring and evaluation system is essential for optimal\n            effectiveness of the MAP learning by doing strategy. There\n            is an urgent need to strengthen the focus on strategic\n            management of the epidemic and tailor the multisectoral\n            approach to Ghana's contained and relatively stable\n            epidemic. The private sector as an engine of growth should\n            be more largely and systematically included in the\n            implementation of the MAP projects. The financing of\n            salaries through donor funds should be considered with\n            caution where it concerns the financing of institutions that\n            need continued and sustainable financing beyond the scope of projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - AIDS Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ghana - AIDS Response
