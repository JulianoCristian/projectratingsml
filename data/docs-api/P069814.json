The second component helps revenue\n            mobilization, provides financing for an international\n            customs advisor, and supports the customs modernization and\n            reform. The third component strengthens the state energy\n            agency in its institutional and technical capacity, thus\n            enabling it to prepare detailed market rules governing the\n            operation of the unbundled electricity and gas sectors; and\n            to monitor rule implementation.
