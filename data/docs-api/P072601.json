Some lessons learned\n            included: when a government is taking a series of measures\n            to improve conditions in rural areas, and rural term credit\n            is in short supply, easing this constraint can have a major\n            positive impact on rural incomes. It also leads to increases\n            in access to other financial services such as use of savings\n            deposits. Credit projects are likely to succeed when they\n            are relatively straightforward in structure, provided that\n            the broad financial sector reform issues have been or are\n            being addressed at the same time. A local commercial bank,\n            if suitably strengthened, may be in the best position to\n            serve as an apex lending institution, provided that there is\n            strong commitment from its senior management including\n            willingness to provide the necessary resources to a Project\n            Management Unit (PMU) and to set up an effective Monitoring\n            and Evaluation (M&E) system. A strong PMU can be used as\n            a training ground for its larger institution, provided the\n            institution's senior management is committed to this\n            rather than isolating the PMU. Private Banks can be\n            attracted to significantly expand term credit in rural\n            areas, provided they have access to longer-term funds and\n            receive appropriate training and Technical Assistance (TA).\n            It is feasible to have vigorous competition among banks,\n            even in poor rural areas. Environmental standards can be\n            introduced even for small sub-borrowers, provided that\n            emphasis is given to education and not just regulation. This\n            is especially important in activities like livestock and\n            aquaculture. Job creation, in relation to investment\n            amounts, is much greater for small subprojects than for\n            larger ones. Beneficiary surveys should be built into credit\n            projects, and should preferably be carried out by or at\n            least with the participation of independent entities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Second Rural Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Second Rural Finance

The total credit provided by the Bank for this\n            project was $110 million. The project has supported several\n            financing initiatives, one of them being mobile banking,\n            which provides services to remote areas without bank\n            branches. Already, the benefits of mobile banking exceed the\n            costs, highlighting the need to provide more and better\n            banking services to people in remote areas who until now\n            have had no formal banks to serve them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Faciliter l'acc\u00e8s au cr\u00e9dit des pauvres\n            des zones rurales au Vietnam"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Extending credit to the rural\n            poor of Vietnam : Faciliter l'acc\u00e8s au cr\u00e9dit des\n            pauvres des zones rurales au Vietnam"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2002/09/23911184/extending-credit-rural-poor-vietnam-faciliter-lacc\u00e8s-au-cr\u00e9dit-des-pauvres-des-zones-rurales-au-vietnam","count":"Vietnam","lang":"French","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Finance","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":",,"}},"lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"},"1":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"majtheme":"Financial and private sector development,Rural development","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Faciliter l'acc\u00e8s au cr\u00e9dit des\n            pauvres des zones rurales au Vietnam"}},"projn":"VN-Second Rural Finance Project -- P072601,VN-Rural Finance -- P004847","topic":"Microfinance m1327227 367,Farm Household Consumption m1326643 1969,Mobile Banking m1326728 1252,Rural Finance m1326285 191,Business Entry and Startup m1326294 1278","docty":"Brief","entityids":{"entityid":"000469252_20150128134004"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","subsc":"Micro- and SME finance,Banking,Central government administration,Micro- and SME finance","theme":"Rural markets,Infrastructure services for private sector development,Other financial and private sector development,Rural policies and institutions,State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization,Rural markets","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Microfinance m1327227 367,Farm Household Consumption m1326643 1969,Mobile Banking m1326728 1252,Rural Finance m1326285 191,Business Entry and Startup m1326294 1278","owner":"Urban, Rural & Soc Dev - GP (GSURR)","Environmental Category":["B","F"],"trustfund":"TF040433-VIETNAM:  RURAL FINANCE II,TF040435-VIETNAM:  RURAL FINANCE II,TF040479-VIETNAM:  RURAL FINANCE II","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"91799"},"facets":{}}}
