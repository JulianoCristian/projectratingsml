Some lessons learned included: the project\n            confirmed the value of community contributions in gaining\n            community commitment to realization and operation of their\n            sub-projects, and in teaching the communities to raise funds\n            for their own development projects. Most village and small\n            town governments can successfully plan for their own\n            development and manage, operate, and maintain their own\n            development projects, with sufficient initial assistance. In\n            addition, a formal complaint mechanism appears to be an\n            important component in mitigating risks of unfair treatment\n            of communities or villagers. It is possible to promote and,\n            to a degree, achieve sustainable outcomes in terms of\n            financing, capacity, methodology, trained people, and\n            institution. Cooperating with donors to ensure continued\n            funding of community-driven investments and to build\n            implementation capacity in local governments and in the\n            regions is imperative. All parties should be in agreement\n            with project guidelines prior to commencing work.\n            Particularly in post-conflict zones, time prior to\n            commencing work may be required to build ties and trust, and\n            should be accounted for. Competitive procurement processes,\n            along with building capacity at the local level can lead to\n            improved efficiency. In the preparing each financing, the\n            team worked with the government and learned the importance\n            of balancing poverty-targeting, through the use of the\n            village deprivation index, with rules assuring an equitable\n            distribution of sub-projects across poor rural areas. It is\n            important to promote and expand the availability and\n            desirability of soft sub-projects that provide long-term\n            skills and sustainability. Using existing procedures allows\n            for rapid implementation with perhaps less capacity using\n            existing procedures, while introducing new procurement\n            procedures can allow for better quality, but will take an\n            extended period of time."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Moldova -

The Second Moldova\n            Social Investment Fund Project (MSIF II) demonstrates good\n            implementation progress. After having completed the\n            implementation program for the original credit MSIF has\n            disbursed about 80 percent of the (first) additional\n            financing credit and fully committed the part of the credit\n            allocated for subprojects. Implementation of the most recent\n            second additional financing credit of USD20 million has\n            reached a very intense phase. The restructuring is\n            undertaken to amend the provisions in the financing\n            agreement for credit to allow utilization of the Government\n            of Moldova (GoM) list of schools that will not be closed\n            under the schools optimization program as a basis for\n            investing the credit proceeds in school-related subprojects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Moldova - Second Social\n            Investment Fund Project : restructuring (Vol. 2) : Data sheet"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/10/15380629/moldova-second-social-investment-fund-project-restructuring-vol-2-data-sheet","projn":"MD-Social Investment Fund 2 Project -- P079314","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,Housing & Human Habitats,Urban Services to the Poor,Bankruptcy and Resolution of Financial Distress","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development,Urban Development","count":"Moldova","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20111027232108"},"subsc":"Energy efficiency in Heat and Power,Water supply,Roads and highways,Primary education,Other social services","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Communities and Human Settlements,Poverty Reduction,Public Sector Development,Urban Development","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Education,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Borrower, communities, Disbursement,\n            employment, Financial Intermediary, poor communities, poor\n            rural communities, population groups, rural communities,\n            Safeguard Policies"}},"owner":"Human Development Sector Unit (ECSHD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF030383-NORWEGIAN CTF FY03 - GENERAL\n            (IDA ELIGIBLE COUNTRIES, ALL SECTORS, ALL,TF051710-JSDF-MOLDOVA: PILOT COMMUNITY\n            DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT(BANK-EXECUTED,TF052114-PHRD-MOLDOVA: SOCIAL INVESTMENT\n            FUND II,TF054460-MOLDOVA SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND 2,TF093407-COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN\n            POST-CONFLICT REGIONS,TF093408-COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN\n            POST-CONFLICT REGIONS (BANK EXECUTED),TFM54460-Social Investment Fund II\n            Project for the Republic of Moldova,TFS54460-MOLDOVA SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND 2","repnb":"65156"},"facets":{}}}
