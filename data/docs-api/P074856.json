Some lessons learned included:\n            the firm selected to provide procurement and management\n            support not only lacked the qualifications for the job, it\n            also lacked incentives to manage effectively. In future\n            projects, Terms of Reference (TOR) should be upgraded to\n            take into account and contracts for such firms should\n            specify that payments be at least partly linked to\n            performance such as disbursements, contract signing, and\n            timely payments to non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\n            Most of the success in Punjab could be attributed to strong\n            ownership of the provincial government that enabled\n            managerial autonomy with continuity of staff, and\n            flexibility in increasing allocations for priority\n            interventions for Internal Documents Unit (IDU). The\n            manager, financial management (FM) and procurement staff\n            continued to be the same individuals throughout the life of\n            the project. Hence, staff continuity with proper\n            administrative authority could be considered as\n            preconditions for the relevant provinces for any future\n            operation. In the meantime, NGO competencies and strong\n            NGO/CBO (community based organization) leadership was\n            another important factor for successes in Punjab. A project\n            which is first of its kind, both in subject and in\n            implementation modalities, must be designed in a flexible\n            manner taking its pilot character into consideration. There\n            should be prior agreement with the Government to make sure\n            there is sufficient flexibility in the Government's\n            planning process in terms of responding to a dynamic\n            epidemic. The project suffered from lack of proper\n            understanding of Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials\n            regarding the importance of confidentiality of the high risk\n            population groups and their HIV status. This requires\n            special advocacy and orientation activities which should\n            have been addressed in the project preparation phase."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - HIV/AIDS

The\n            main components will: 1) expand interventions among\n            vulnerable populations, by supporting HIV prevention\n            services to vulnerable groups, particularly those people\n            living in large cities. This would include behavioral change\n            through information communication, promotion of effective\n            condom use, counseling and HIV testing, and proper\n            management of sexually transmitted diseases. Small grants\n            will be made available to build capacity of nongovernmental\n            organizations (NGOs), and institutions working on HIV/AIDS,\n            to allow development of a track record so as to increase\n            their role in HIV prevention, and, to develop improved\n            testing, innovative approaches, and operational research; 2)\n            improve HIV prevention by the general population, which\n            comprises a behavior change communication, to be coordinated\n            between the National AIDS Control Program (NACP) and\n            provincial programs to undertake behavior changes towards\n            the use of condoms, of sterile syringes, blood donation, and\n            transfusions, and caring behaviors towards people affected\n            by the epidemic, based on targeted interventions, and\n            improved management of sexually transmitted infections\n            (STI); 3) prevent HIV/STI transmission through blood\n            transfusions, by building the capacity of provincial blood\n            transfusion authorities, implementing a quality assurance\n            system, blood screening, and, adequate waste management;\n            and, 4) strengthen federal, and provincial AIDS control\n            programs, build NGOs' capacity through technical\n            assistance and training, support second generation HIV\n            surveillance, and evaluation, and, support caring for people\n            living with AIDS."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Pakistan - HIV/AIDS Prevention
