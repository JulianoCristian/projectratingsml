It is\n            impossible to rate the project since some activities have\n            not been completed because of the sanctions imposed on\n            Yugoslavia by the United Nations Security Council. The\n            project components in Vojvodina were financed separately by\n            a loan in the amount of US$35.0 million. Of this amount,\n            US$2.6 million was cancelled in 1992 while US$32.4 million\n            had been disbursed. After mid-1991, some project components\n            became progressively delayed due to hostilities between the\n            Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia\n            so that not all the objectives of the project were reached.\n            The composition of the project remained very much as\n            designed at appraisal.

However, contacts with the Borrower became\n            sporadic after 1990 as a result of sanctions. Following the\n            United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia, the\n            Borrower's special project account was blocked,\n            delaying final payments for essential material."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - First Petroleum Sector Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - First Petroleum\n            Sector Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/02/732004/yugoslavia-first-petroleum-sector-project","projn":"Gas Sector -- P009212","docty":"Note on Cancelled Operation","subtopic":"Oil Refining & Gas Industry,Energy and Environment,Mining & Extractive Industry (Non-Energy),Oil & Gas,Water and Industry","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970619110843"},"subsc":"(Historic)Oil and gas exploration and development","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Oil & Gas","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"atmosphere,bentonite,coal,construction,crude\n            oil,crude oil prices,currency units,drilling,drilling,energy\n            conservation,energy resources,exploration,exploration\n            drilling,extraction,field equipment,Gas,gas bearing,gas\n            demand,gas exploration,gas field,gas fields,gas\n            operations,gas price,gas producers,gas production,gas\n            recovery,gas reserves,gas reservoirs,gas storage,gas\n            supply,geological exploration,geological\n            information,geological\n            model,geology,geophysics,hydrocarbons,lignite,oil,oil and\n            gas,oil and gas production,oil company,oil consumption,oil\n            exploration,oil field,oil field equipment,oil fields,oil\n            industry,Oil production,Oil production rate,Oil\n            Recovery,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,petroleum\n            industry,petroleum production,Petroleum Sector,primary\n            energy,project\n            management,refining,reservoirs,rocks,sediments,Supervision Reports,Sustainability,wells"},"1":{"cdata!":"atmosphere,bentonite,coal,construction,crude\n            oil,crude oil prices,currency units,drilling,drilling,energy\n            conservation,energy resources,exploration,exploration\n            drilling,extraction,field equipment,Gas,gas bearing,gas\n            demand,gas exploration,gas field,gas fields,gas\n            operations,gas price,gas producers,gas production,gas\n            recovery,gas reserves,gas reservoirs,gas storage,gas\n            supply,geological exploration,geological\n            information,geological\n            model,geology,geophysics,hydrocarbons,lignite,oil,oil and\n            gas,oil and gas production,oil company,oil consumption,oil\n            exploration,oil field,oil field equipment,oil fields,oil\n            industry,Oil production,Oil production rate,Oil\n            Recovery,Petroleum,petroleum exploration,petroleum\n            industry,petroleum production,Petroleum Sector,primary\n            energy,project\n            management,refining,reservoirs,rocks,sediments,Supervision Reports,Sustainability,wells"}},"owner":"ECA Sector Units","repnb":"16329"},"732005":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/02/732005/bosnia-herzegovina-first-petroleum-sector-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1997/02/732005/bosnia-herzegovina-first-petroleum-sector-project","new_url":"1997/02/732005/bosnia-herzegovina-first-petroleum-sector-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2016-09-06T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2016-09-06T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","docm_id":"090224b0828aad20","chronical_docm_id":"090224b0828aad20","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1997/02/20/000009265_3970716145454/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1997/02/20/000009265_3970716145454/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","datestored":"2001-07-04T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1997-02-20T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Bosnia-Herzegovina - First Petroleum Sector Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The First Petroleum Sector Project Loan\n            for the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that\n            were located in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was\n            approved by the Board on June 27, 1985 and became effective\n            on August 15, 1986.
