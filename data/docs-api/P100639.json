When defining broad\n            objectives as a partner to implement activities such as EU\n            accession negotiations, the Bank has little control on\n            timing and in phasing its activities requiring a very\n            flexible implementation approach where procurement often\n            fills immediate needs that may not have been fully\n            identified at project preparation. This project as most\n            projects of this sort supporting EU pre-accession invested\n            very substantial portions of the funding in building\n            government owned national reference testing capacity.\n            Investments for mitigation of environmental pollution\n            measures in agriculture depend on public support and\n            incentives and minimum farm size. The EU accession agenda,\n            successful partnership with other donors and strengthening\n            capacities for the country to effectively absorb and\n            administer EU funding remain the primary focus of the\n            Bank's ongoing engagement in Croatia.

Pollution Control Project is to significantly\n            increase the use of environmentally friendly agricultural\n            practices by farmers in Croatia's Danube River Basin in\n            order to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural sources\n            to surface and ground water bodies. This GEF investment has\n            four components and is a pilot activity to be implemented in\n            three selected counties of Croatia: (i) Osije?ko-Baranjska;\n            (ii) Vukovarsko-Srijemska; and (iii) Vara\u009edinska. The first\n            project component consists of mitigating nutrient loads to\n            water bodies from point-source pollution (manure management)\n            which will assist the Government of Croatia to promote\n            sustainable manure management practices with the objective\n            of reducing nutrient loads to the surface and ground water\n            bodies of Croatia. The second component consists of\n            development and promotion of agro-environment measures which\n            will assist with the implementation of the Code of Good\n            Agricultural Practices (CGAP), currently under preparation.\n            The third component consists of a public awareness and\n            replication strategy which will disseminate the benefits of\n            proposed project activities. Finally, the fourth component\n            consists of project management which involves the\n            establishment of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) whose\n            aim is to mainstream
