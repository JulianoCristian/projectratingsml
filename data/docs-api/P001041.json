The\n            project achieved its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, an appropriate macroeconomic framework is\n            essential to achieving success. Second, sound project\n            identification and preparation are helpful in recognizing\n            the major difficulties likely to be encountered during\n            implementation. Third, the frequency and regularity of\n            supervision missions and their composition of technical\n            specialists and representatives of co-financiers contributed\n            significantly to successful project implementation. Fourth,\n            a full and frank dialogue between the Bank and Government\n            was constructive and helpful in obtaining a successful\n            project outcome. Fifth, training can play a key role in\n            upgrading skills. Sixth, the mid-term review can be very\n            helpful in making midcourse changes during implementation to\n            reorient some project components. Finally, the timely\n            availability of counterpart funding will require particular\n            attention in the future."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Livestock Sector Rehabilitation

herd and thereby augment national meat and milk\n            production, will be implemented over five years and will\n            include three main components. They will involve (a) support\n            for the privatisation process of livestock service; (b)\n            strengthening of a reduced public livestock service; and (c)\n            provisions of about 19 staff-years of internationally\n            recruited specialists and thirty nine staff-months of\n            short-term consultants. The first component will be achieved\n            through: establishment of herdsmen's associations;\n            creation of an Input Supply Center for livestock inputs; and\n            provision of a small pilot credit component for the\n            establishment of private veterinarians, for setting up\n            animal production farms, for herdsmen's associations,\n            and for distribution of livestock inputs. The second\n            component will be accomplished through: upgrading of the\n            infrastructure of the central livestock department in\n            Conakry and 33 field offices with provision of equipment,\n            vehicles and basic materials; establishment of a training\n            center in Labe with a capacity for 40 students; provision of\n            fellowships for external training of high level staff, and\n            provision of equipment and vehicles for annual national\n            vaccination campaigns."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Livestock Sector
