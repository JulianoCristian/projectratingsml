      low-income groups in Morocco; (b) assist CIH in its efforts\n            to encourage both private and public developers to produce\n            low income housing; and (c) develop CIH's appraisal\n            ability in this field. To achieve these objectives the\n            project will finance construction of low-cost housing\n            schemes for subsequent sale of housing units targeted at the\n            selected income group through CIH and a technical assistance\n            program to CIH. The direct benefits from the project will be\n            the provision of about 13,000 new housing units affordable\n            to households in the lower half of the urban income\n            distribution, with monthly incomes below $330. About 40\n            percent of these units will benefit population with incomes\n            below the urban poverty threshold, about $170 per household\n            per month. The project will also promote home ownership as a\n            means of mobilizing individual savings and help to reduce\n            government subsidy in the housing sector through increased\n            interest rates."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Housing Loan To Credit Immobilier\n            Et Hotelier Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Housing Loan To Credit\n
