initiated in January 1980. The principal\n            aim of the program is to redirect the Turkish economy\n            towards a development path placing more reliance on market\n            forces and outward-orientation. The measures to be taken in\n            this phase of the program fall into two main categories: (i)\n            at the macroeconomic level, the program includes the\n            development of a medium term framework consistent with the\n            ongoing structural adjustment program, continued\n            rationalization of public investment, further import\n            liberalization, and installation of a computerized debt\n            management system. (ii) at the sectoral level, the program\n            includes the implementation of measures to address\n            structural issues in the financial sector and preparation of\n            action plans for the agriculture and energy sectors. The\n            loan will finance all imports with the exception of items\n            financed by other sources, military or para-military items,\n            luxury goods and nuclear
