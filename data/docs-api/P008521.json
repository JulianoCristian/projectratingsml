The project achieved all its major relevant\n            objectives and is expected to achieve relevant development\n            results. The outcome was substantially effected by external\n            shocks since 1998. Lessons confirm that institutional reform\n            is a highly complex and time consuming process. Budget and\n            intergovernmental finance reforms require time and capacity\n            building to implement, with a long term approach essential.\n            Such reforms are dependent on the budget cycle, with risk\n            reduced by having a committed government. Fiscal\n            decentralization needs effective local accountability to\n            provide benefits. Donor commitment is needed to provide\n            timely technical assistance and ensure effective burden\n            sharing. Reforms in budget management need to be linked to\n            administrative and civil service reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kyrgyz Republic - Public Sector Resource\n            Management
