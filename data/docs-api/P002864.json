Some lessons learned included:\n            the importance of modesty and realism in reform programs in\n            an institutionally weak sector such as health. Reading over\n            the Government's statement of health programs and\n            objectives, one cannot help but be struck by its excessively\n            ambitious character, particularly under an adjustment\n            Program which was to be implemented in a four-year period.\n            In an environment facing severe financial and human resource\n            constraints, a phased implementation reduces risks of\n            failure. A phased approach, with a more modest start and a\n            greater focus on priorities, would have been more\n            appropriate than the Health and Population Sector Adjustment\n            Program (HPSAP) in view of the financial and human resources\n            constraints faced by the country. The importance of\n            practical, operational decentralization. The Government\n            realized at the end of the program that it needed to carry\n            out an effective decentralization of the health system and\n            achieve effective community management of health services in\n            order to overcome the crisis affecting the health sector.\n            Such decentralization would need to focus more than in the\n            past on effective utilization of health services by the\n            affected population, rather than only on their supply."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Health and Population Sector\n            Adjustment
