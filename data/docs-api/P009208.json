Bank's performance was also\n            unsatisfactory; mistakes in project design, poor procurement\n            arrangements, and ineffective supervision over the first\n            four years were factors contributing to project failure. The\n            outcome of the project is rated as highly unsatisfactory,\n            its institutional development as negligible, and its\n            sustainability as unlikely. The project was not completed\n            due to: (i) extraordinary delays in effectiveness in\n            establishing the local agency for constructing the federal\n            dispatch center, and in preparing the first set of bidding\n            documents; and (ii) the eventual disintegration of the\n            country in 1992. Investment planning coordination did not\n            occur and the electricity pricing targets were never met.\n            The following are the principal project lessons: (i) The\n            problems of obtaining and sustaining real commitment of all\n            the diverse members of such an interconnected power system\n            must not be underestimated, especially in this case. (ii)\n            Technologically complex projects such as the Energy\n            Management System (EMS) project should not be allowed to\n            proceed to the implementation stage without continuous\n            involvement of consultants with established minimum levels\n            of proven experience in Real Time Control System (RTCS)\n            systems and especially of its unique procurement\n            requirements. (iii) During design of contract packaging of\n            EMS systems, special care should be taken to ensure\n            compatibility, which should be a paramount consideration;\n            (iv) Prequalification of bidders must be carried out on the\n            basis of clearly specified minimum proven experience\n            requirements and should never be waived; (v) Loans for such\n            extremely complex projects, particularly when it involves\n            multiple borrowers, should not be presented to the Board\n            unless final bidding documents, acceptable to the Bank, have\n            been prepared for all the key contracts; (vi) For\n            technologically complex projects such as the EMS the\n            standard Bank procurement approach, devised for simple\n            equipment, must not be used; (vii) To ensure financial\n            soundness of power entities, financial covenants should\n            focus on financial performance rather than economic\n            methodology, such as Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC). (viii)\n            In such parallel financing schemes, the lending agencies\n            should agree at the start on the specific items which would\n            be financed by the respective loans. This was not done under\n            the project, leaving the Borrowers in doubt on such aspects\n            as the procurement policies to be followed for different\n            items; and (ix) The Bank's firm approach in recognizing\n            past errors in project design, procurement, and consultancy\n            arrangements and correcting them quickly during 1987-1990\n            were effective and ultimately appreciated by the Borrowers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Third Power Transmission Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Third Power\n            Transmission Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/06/735003/yugoslavia-third-power-transmission-project","projn":"Power Trans.Iii -- P009208","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,General Technology,Information Technology,Pharmaceuticals & Pharmacoeconomics,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Energy,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961019144911"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Energy,Information and Communication Technologies,Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,application\n            software,basic,bidding,Borrower,commitment,commitment\n            charges,compatible hardware,competitive bidding,computer\n            systems,computer technology,decision\n            making,disbursement,Disbursements,Electric\n            Power,electricity,engineering,engineering\n            services,feasibility,Guarantee Agreements,LOAN,loan\n            agreement,loan agreements,loan amount,loan\n            disbursements,loan effectiveness,local financing,marginal\n            costs,modem,Modernization,networks,packaging,Power,power\n            development,power equipment,Power Industry,power\n            sector,power stations,power supplies,Power\n            Transmission,procurement,project implementation,Real\n            Time,SAL,Structural Adjustment,suppliers,technicians,tranche"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,application\n            software,basic,bidding,Borrower,commitment,commitment\n            charges,compatible hardware,competitive bidding,computer\n            systems,computer technology,decision\n            making,disbursement,Disbursements,Electric\n            Power,electricity,engineering,engineering\n            services,feasibility,Guarantee Agreements,LOAN,loan\n            agreement,loan agreements,loan amount,loan\n            disbursements,loan effectiveness,local financing,marginal\n            costs,modem,Modernization,networks,packaging,Power,power\n            development,power equipment,Power Industry,power\n            sector,power stations,power supplies,Power\n            Transmission,procurement,project implementation,Real\n            Time,SAL,Structural Adjustment,suppliers,technicians,tranche"}},"owner":"ECA Sector Units","repnb":"14795"},"740273":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/07/740273/yugoslavia-third-power-transmission-energy-management-system-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1983/07/740273/yugoslavia-third-power-transmission-energy-management-system-project","new_url":"1983/07/740273/yugoslavia-third-power-transmission-energy-management-system-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1983/07/01/000009265_3970718101259/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1983/07/01/000009265_3970718101259/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"2338","datestored":"1983-07-01T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1983-07-31T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Third Power Transmission\n            (Energy Management System) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"This Third Power Transmission Project is\n            the first of a two stage program to install a national\n            electric power management system (EMS) which consists of a\n            computerized system.

It should\n            gradually lead to a reduction and/or postponement in\n            investments for future generating plants and transmission."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yugoslavia - Third Power Transmission\n            (Energy Management System) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yugoslavia - Third Power\n            Transmission (Energy Management System) Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1983/04/725513/yugoslavia-third-power-transmission-energy-management-system-project","projn":"Power Trans.Iii -- P009208","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy","count":"World","entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901004666"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Science and Technology Development,Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"animal wastes,brown coal,bulk\n            power,COAL,combustion,common good,conservation,covers,crude\n            oil,dams,demand for electricity,economies of\n            scale,elasticity,Electric Power,Electric Power\n            Industry,Electricity,Electricity Consumption,electricity\n            generation,Electricity Pricing,Electricity\n            Supply,electricity use,energy investment,Energy\n            Management,Energy planning,energy policy,energy\n            pricing,Energy Resources,ENERGY\n            SECTOR,engineering,Environmental\n            Impact,exploitation,Fuel,fuels,Gas,generation of\n            electricity,grid,hard\n            coal,heat,hydrocarbons,hydrology,imports,Insurance,Lignite,local\n            authorities,mines,mirrors,natural gas,nuclear power,Oil,oil\n            crisis,oil reserves,oil shale,petroleum,petroleum\n            exploration,petroleum products,power development,power\n            generation,power lines,power plant,power plants,power\n            sector,power stations,Power System,power systems,power\n            transfer,Power Transmission,proven reserves,renewable\n            energy,renewable energy resources,river basins,savings,solar\n            energy,solid fuels,Structural Adjustment,thermal power,Transport,utilities,voltage"},"1":{"cdata!":"animal wastes,brown coal,bulk\n            power,COAL,combustion,common good,conservation,covers,crude\n            oil,dams,demand for electricity,economies of\n            scale,elasticity,Electric Power,Electric Power\n            Industry,Electricity,Electricity Consumption,electricity\n            generation,Electricity Pricing,Electricity\n            Supply,electricity use,energy investment,Energy\n            Management,Energy planning,energy policy,energy\n            pricing,Energy Resources,ENERGY\n            SECTOR,engineering,Environmental\n            Impact,exploitation,Fuel,fuels,Gas,generation of\n            electricity,grid,hard\n            coal,heat,hydrocarbons,hydrology,imports,Insurance,Lignite,local\n            authorities,mines,mirrors,natural gas,nuclear power,Oil,oil\n            crisis,oil reserves,oil shale,petroleum,petroleum\n            exploration,petroleum products,power development,power\n            generation,power lines,power plant,power plants,power\n            sector,power stations,Power System,power systems,power\n            transfer,Power Transmission,proven reserves,renewable\n            energy,renewable energy resources,river basins,savings,solar\n            energy,solid fuels,Structural Adjustment,thermal power,Transport,utilities,voltage"}},"owner":"ECA Sector Units","repnb":"4193"},"facets":{}}}
