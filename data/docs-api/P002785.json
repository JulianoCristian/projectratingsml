Both World Bank\n            and Borrower performance were generally satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: Traditional systems of woodland\n            management are strengthened by working with villagers to\n            protect and conserve these resources themselves and through\n            socio-legal mechanisms which villagers themselves control\n            and maintain. Community involvement in joint forest\n            management of government reserves can lead to improving the\n            condition of reserves; pilot approaches could be\n            strengthened by transferring decisionmaking more fully to\n            the communities involved. Dry woodland management poses good\n            opportunities because of the resilience of the woodland to\n            harvesting, the cost-effectiveness of relying on natural\n            regeneration with minimal silvicultural treatments, and the\n            few risks to the environment posed by sustainable management\n            of dry woodland ecosystems. Adopting the farmers'\n            simple technologies is more apt than relying on high-tech\n            approaches. Community participation in surveying village\n            lands is essential and cost-effective since it reduced\n            litigation, leading to considerable savings in time and\n            resources. When project identification and preparation is\n            bolstered by strategic studies, action-oriented research,\n            and ESW, there are significant benefits. Future investments\n            will likely be jeopardized without institutional reform.\n            Technical supervision of advisory services needs to be\n            strengthened and supported."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tanzania - Forest Resources Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tanzania - Forest Resources\n            Management

         private sector and local populations in the management of\n            natural resources in Tanzania.  The project includes the\n            following components:  (a) strengthening of the natural\n            resources monitoring and forest policies; (b) strengthening\n            of land policies and institutions; and (c) strengthening of\n            regional and district forest services in Mwanza and Tabora\n            regions.
