The project consists of a raw materials\n            plant with a production capacity of about 1,250,000 tons per\n            year of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene and other\n            petroleum derivatives and a utilities plant consisting of\n            (i) steam production facilities; (ii) water treatment\n            facilties to treat and demineralize water for utility and\n            process requirements; and (iii) power generation facilities\n            for critical operations that cannot tolerate power\n            interruptions. The petrochemical complex would substantially\n            reduce Brazil's need to import petrochemicals and\n            produce net annual foreign exchange savings of about US$510\n            million (at 1977 prices) by 1985. It would also help to\n            diversify industry away from the main industrialized areas\n            of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.

- COPESUL Petrochemical Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project would form the core of the\n            third petrochemical complex around which industries\n            producing intermediate and some of the final products would\n            be established. The project consists of a raw materials\n            plant with a production capacity of about 1,250,000 tons per\n            year of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene and other\n            petroleum derivatives and a utilities plant consisting of\n            (i) steam production facilities; (ii) water treatment\n            facilties to treat and demineralize water for utility and\n            process requirements; and (iii) power generation facilities\n            for critical operations that cannot tolerate power\n            interruptions. The petrochemical complex would substantially\n            reduce Brazil's need to import petrochemicals and\n            produce net annual foreign exchange savings of about US$510\n            million (at 1977 prices) by 1985. It would also help to\n            diversify industry away from the main industrialized areas\n            of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The project faces some\n            risks but government pricing policies and involvement in\n            selecting suitable sponsors for the downstream units coupled\n            with Bank and IFC involvement in the preparation and\n            financing of these units would reduce the risks to\n            acceptable levels."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - COPESUL Petrochemical Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - COPESUL Petrochemical Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/04/726958/brazil-copesul-petrochemical-project","projn":"BR-Petrochemicals I -- P006289","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Chemical & Petrochemical Industry,Water and Industry,Montreal Protocol,Consumption","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Brazil","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912373447"},"subsc":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"absorption,aggregate\n            demand,alcohols,aluminum,ammonia,asbestos,balance of\n            payments,benzene,broad range,capital goods,carbon,carbon\n            black,carbons,chemical\n            production,co,Coal,Construction,consumer goods,crude\n            oil,debt,detergents,developed countries,domestic\n            demand,dyestuffs,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economies of\n            scale,Employment,ethane,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fertilizers,food\n            production,Gas,gases,hydrocarbon,imports,Income,industrial\n            expansion,intermediate\n            goods,MARKETING,metals,methanol,Nylon,oil,oil\n            prices,oils,organic chemicals,pesticides,PETROCHEMICAL\n            INDUSTRY,petrochemical\n            products,Petrochemicals,Petroleum,plant\n            growth,plastics,pollution,pollution\n            control,polyester,Polyethylene,Polypropylene,Polystyrene,PP,producers,Project\n            Management,propane,PVC,renewable\n            resources,Rubber,sales,savings,social\n            costs,soils,solvents,synthetic\n            fibers,temperature,Thermoplastics,timber,Toluene,users,Vinyl\n            Chloride,Vinyl Chloride Monomer,xylene"},"1":{"cdata!":"absorption,aggregate\n            demand,alcohols,aluminum,ammonia,asbestos,balance of\n            payments,benzene,broad range,capital goods,carbon,carbon\n            black,carbons,chemical\n            production,co,Coal,Construction,consumer goods,crude\n            oil,debt,detergents,developed countries,domestic\n            demand,dyestuffs,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economies of\n            scale,Employment,ethane,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,fertilizers,food\n            production,Gas,gases,hydrocarbon,imports,Income,industrial\n            expansion,intermediate\n            goods,MARKETING,metals,methanol,Nylon,oil,oil\n            prices,oils,organic chemicals,pesticides,PETROCHEMICAL\n            INDUSTRY,petrochemical\n            products,Petrochemicals,Petroleum,plant\n            growth,plastics,pollution,pollution\n            control,polyester,Polyethylene,Polypropylene,Polystyrene,PP,producers,Project\n            Management,propane,PVC,renewable\n            resources,Rubber,sales,savings,social\n            costs,soils,solvents,synthetic\n            fibers,temperature,Thermoplastics,timber,Toluene,users,Vinyl\n            Chloride,Vinyl Chloride Monomer,xylene"}},"owner":"WB Office: Brasilia, Brazil CMU (LCC5C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"repnb":"1842"},"facets":{}}}
