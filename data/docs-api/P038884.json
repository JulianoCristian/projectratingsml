The\n            lessons of this project include: Community Driven\n            Development projects can successfully support decentralize\n            resource allocation and create social capital in poor rural\n            areas. The equitable graduation of communities who have\n            accumulated sufficient assets and organizational capacity to\n            access mainstream financing and other services, is expected\n            to be an important product of this more integrated approach\n            to Municipal Community Scheme Council roles/activities.\n            Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-making\n            and implementation to the state and local levels ensures\n            administrative efficiency and superior results.\n            Participation by beneficiaries in the selection, financing,\n            execution, and organization and management of subprojects\n            ensures that investments meet genuine community needs.\n            Poverty targeting mechanisms that are simple, verifiable and\n            based on objective criteria foster transparency, minimize\n            political interference in project resource allocation and\n            ensure that project resources reach the poorest.

leveraging revenue\n            mobilization at the community and municipal levels. The\n            project will ensure that funds are targeted and reliably\n            transferred to the poorest communities, will promote further\n            decentralization of decision making to State, municipal and\n            local levels. The project comprises three main components:\n            community subprojects, consisting of infrastructure, social\n            and productive or small-scale industrial projects;\n            institutional development providing technical assistance and\n            training in implementing new project schemes; and\n            administration, monitoring, and evaluation. The Ceara Rural\n            Poverty Alleviation Project will assist the State in\n            alleviating rural poverty and its consequences by: 1)\n            providing basic social and economic infrastructure, and\n            employment and income-generating opportunities for the rural\n            poor; 2) supporting rural communities in planning and\n            implementing their own subprojects; 3) providing a safety\n            net for the rural poor during a period of strong fiscal\n            adjustment when the Government's ability to finance\n            essential investments and services is constrained; and 4)\n            leveraging revenue mobilization at the community and\n            municipal levels. The project will ensure that funds are\n            targeted and reliability transferred to the poorest\n            communities, and would promote further decentralization of\n            decision making to State, municipal and local levels. The\n            project comprises the following three components: community\n            subprojects including infrastructure, social and small-scale\n            productive industrial projects; institutional development\n            providing all implementing communities with technical\n            assistance and training for project implementation; and\n            administration, monitoring and evaluation. The objective of\n            the Sergipe Rural Poverty Alleviation project is to assist\n            the State in alleviating rural poverty and its consequences\n            by: 1) providing basic infrastructure and employment and\n            income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; 2)\n            supporting rural community groups in planning and\n            implementing their own subprojects; 3) providing a safety\n            net for the rural poor during a period of strong fiscal\n            adjustment when the Government's ability to finance\n            essential investments and services is constrained; and 4)\n            leveraging revenue mobilization at the community and\n            municipal levels. The project will ensure that funds are\n            targeted and reliably transferred to the poorest\n            communities, and will promote further decentralization of\n            decision-making to State, municipal and local levels. The\n            project comprises three components: community subprojects\n            supporting infrastrture, social, and productive small-scale\n            industrial investments; institutional development providing\n            technical assistance and training to increase capacity and\n            improve implementation of the project; and project\n            administration, monitoring and evaluation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation\n            Program for the States of Bahia, Ceara and Sergipe"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil -
