The objectives of the project were\n            to: (a) remedy the existing constraints to rapidly\n            increasing Poland's exports of processed agricultural\n            products to convertible currency (CC) countries; (b) assist\n            the lending institutions associated with the project and the\n            state-owned enterprises financed under it to operate in a\n            market-oriented environment; (c) promote further involvement\n            of the private sector in food processing activities that are\n            export-oriented; and (d) help maintain supplies of livestock\n            to processors, and thus sustain meat exports. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (a) credit lines are inappropriate instruments in the\n            absence of strong financial intermediaries and in\n            environments of significant monetary instability\n            characterized by high inflation and interest rates; (b)\n            successful restructuring of medium to large state-owned\n            enterprises   cannot be accomplished without sweeping\n            reforms that address questions of enterprise ownership and\n            governance; (c) the need for Bank projects to have strong\n            institutional components to complement the provision of\n            funds; and (d) the danger of emphasizing disbursements, as a\n            measure of performance, as they are not necessarily\n            correlated to results on the ground."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland - Agroindustries Export Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Poland - Agroindustries Export\n

In\n            order to generate incremental CC export earnings, the\n            project will aim to rehabilitate, modernize and expand\n            existing agro-processing industries. Investments in the\n            needed equipment will be such as to allow Polish products to\n            be upgraded to levels of quality required in western markets\n            and will result in higher prices because of improved quality\n            and packaging, and increased volume of exports. This will be\n            particularly the case for ham in cans and in vacuum packing,\n            frozen fruits and vegatables and forest products including\n            game meat and berries, which are exported mainly to EEC\n            countries.
