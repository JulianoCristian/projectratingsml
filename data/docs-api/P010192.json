The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, sustainability is unlikely, its\n            impact on institutional development is negligible, and both\n            the Bank and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several lessons\n            can be learned from this project. First, components without\n            appropriate design and clear operational directives are\n            unlikely to do well. Second, the scope of any project and\n            the scale of its operations should be based on a careful and\n            in-depth analysis of the Borrower's financial and\n            managerial capabilities. Third, suitable planting areas\n            should be identified in advance, appropriate forest\n            management plans with supporting forest inventory\n            information should be available, and operational directives\n            should be clearly defined. Fourth, effective project\n            implementation can only be ensured by appointing an\n            experienced and energetic head for the project's\n            implementation unit, maintaining continuity in that\n            appointment, and establishing close coordination between\n            different agencies involved in the project. Fifth, focusing\n            on qualitative aspects is important for the impact and\n            sustainability of a project in the long run. Sixth, it is\n            desirable to identify beneficiaries and organize them in\n            small user groups with defined roles, responsibilities and\n            harvesting rights from the outset. Lastly, a meaningful\n            project impact evaluation is possible only when an efficient\n            M&E system is established and information is collected."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Second
