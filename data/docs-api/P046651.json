The\n            lessons learned indicate that procurement should be\n            completed before negotiations. Only one round of bidding,\n            properly formatted, should have taken place. The second\n            round seems to have distorted the final outcome. Project\n            implementation needed better and more timely coordination\n            among co-lenders on issues involving procurement and\n            processing of payments, since the project's complex\n            financing arrangements undermined project execution. The\n            Senegal River Basin Organization (OMVS) states need to adopt\n            a common health care strategy that would enable them to\n            implement a policy focusing on the health problems affecting\n            the population living within the Senegal River basin. An\n            action program has been implemented to mitigate the\n            environmental impacts of construction of the dam, the power\n            plant, and the electricity transmission system. Access to\n            potable water supply and sanitation, electricity, and health\n            services should contribute to the success of poverty\n            alleviation schemes undertaken at the local, regional, and\n            national levels. The successful experience of OMVS has been\n            instrumental in the appointment of the High Commission as\n            the secretariat of the African Network for Basin\n            Organizations (ANBO)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -
