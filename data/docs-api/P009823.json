There are no risks other\n            than those normally associated with this type of project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Fourth Trombay Thermal Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Fourth Trombay Thermal\n            Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1984/05/725287/india-fourth-trombay-thermal-power-project","projn":"IN-Trombay Power IV -- P009823","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Energy and Environment,Engineering,Power & Energy Conversion,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Energy","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901033077"},"subsc":"(Historic)Thermal","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting practices,Accounting\n            Systems,aggregate demand,Balance Sheets,bulk power,Capital\n            Base,coal,Commercial Banks,construction,current\n            assets,Debt,deficits,electric power stations,electrical\n            energy,Electricity,Electricity Boards,electricity\n            distribution,electricity supply,energy\n            consumption,Engineering,Engineers,financial\n            management,financial performance,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,fuel,generator,grid,grids,Housing,hydro\n            power,Hydroelectric Power,Income,Income\n            Statements,Insurance,interlocks,irrigation,Legislation,Local\n            Financial Institutions,LRMC,marginal cost pricing,member\n            States,Natural Gas,Nuclear Power,Oil,oil\n            refining,Petroleum,Power,Power Company,power\n            development,power generation,power industry,power\n            plant,power projects,POWER SECTOR,power stations,Power\n            Supply,power system,Power Transmission,Profitability,public\n            works,rainfall,Redemption,Rural\n            Electrification,savings,Security Arrangements,skilled\n            workers,technicians,Thermal Power,Thermal Power Plants,Transport,utilities,voltage"},"1":{"cdata!":"Accounting,accounting practices,Accounting\n            Systems,aggregate demand,Balance Sheets,bulk power,Capital\n            Base,coal,Commercial Banks,construction,current\n            assets,Debt,deficits,electric power stations,electrical\n            energy,Electricity,Electricity Boards,electricity\n            distribution,electricity supply,energy\n            consumption,Engineering,Engineers,financial\n            management,financial performance,FISCAL YEAR,foreign\n            exchange,fuel,generator,grid,grids,Housing,hydro\n            power,Hydroelectric Power,Income,Income\n            Statements,Insurance,interlocks,irrigation,Legislation,Local\n            Financial Institutions,LRMC,marginal cost pricing,member\n            States,Natural Gas,Nuclear Power,Oil,oil\n            refining,Petroleum,Power,Power Company,power\n            development,power generation,power industry,power\n            plant,power projects,POWER SECTOR,power stations,Power\n            Supply,power system,Power Transmission,Profitability,public\n            works,rainfall,Redemption,Rural\n            Electrification,savings,Security Arrangements,skilled\n            workers,technicians,Thermal Power,Thermal Power Plants,Transport,utilities,voltage"}},"owner":"South Asia Sector Units","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"repnb":"4536"},"facets":{}}}
