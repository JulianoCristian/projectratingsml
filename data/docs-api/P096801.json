Some lessons\n            learned included: higher-level and more coordinated\n            communications between the Bank and government, bringing\n            together key government stakeholders earlier on in the\n            project, can help to more effectively and transparently\n            address project issues. Supply-and-installation contract\n            shifts most of the responsibilities of project\n            implementation to the contractors, therefore reduces the\n            complexity of contract management. However, in order to\n            effectively implement this type of contract, the following\n            conditions are necessary: (i) the implementation agency can\n            carry out project design in a sufficient and timely manner;\n            (ii) the borrower can assume the risks associated with the\n            design and engineering practice; (iii) project scope and\n            design are clearly defined before both parties enter into\n            the contract; and (iv) the implementation agency has\n            sufficient capacity to monitor project progress on the\n            ground. Currently, an extensive effort is being carried out\n            by the Bank to consult with external stakeholders in order\n            to improve the Bank's procurement policies. One area\n            for consideration is how to reconcile differences between\n            Bank's procurement rules and the country's\n            procurement system so as to improve efficiency. A\n            resettlement policy framework is recommended to minimize\n            risks of potential negative effectives under involuntary resettlement."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey - Electricity
