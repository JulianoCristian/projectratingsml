The principal objective of PEDP was to\n            support the development of new private businesses through\n            providing financing for their investment needs. Bank's\n            performance was satisfactory. Borrower's performance\n            was satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows:\n            (i) assessing private sector financing needs and demand for\n            credit is never an exact science, but is even more difficult\n            during a period of intense economic transformation; (ii)\n            given this uncertainty it might have been better to have\n            either: (a) gone with a pilot type of approach to SME\n            lending, using a small loan to test the situation and get a\n            better understanding of credit demand and capacity of the\n            banking system, or (b) demonstrated a much more flexible\n            supervision approach,retrofitting or canceling the operation\n            when it became evident that serious problems were\n            developing; (iii) lending through an apex institution can be\n            less effective than lending directly to banks, since direct\n            lending creates competition, reduces layers and increases\n            ownership; and (iv) when working with new borrowers and\n            intermediaries, especially in a transition economy where\n            practical experience with modern credit development and\n            appraisal techniques is very limited, procedures and\n            requirements need to be streamlined as much as possible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Poland -
