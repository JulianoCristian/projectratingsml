The project had two main objectives: a) to provide\n            the external financing required to sustain during 1984-85\n            the scheduled pace of several high priority electricity\n            development projects that were under construction, and in\n            their connection to re-enlist the support of foreign\n            commercial lenders to the power sector and to Colombia\n            through a co-financing package; and b) to support the\n            development of Financiers Electrica Nacional (FEN). FEN had\n            been created in 1982 in conformance with an undertaking made\n            by the Government in 1981 under the Guavio Hydro Power\n            Project when it was recognized that the local currency cost\n            component of the power sector investment program could not\n            be met entirely through self generated funds. FEN's\n            development was to be supported in several respects: to\n            enable it to serve as an effective channel for power sector\n            lending projects in Colombia; to strengthen the financial\n            management of the sector by enhancing FEN's ability to\n            monitor the financial performance and prospects of Colombian\n            power companies and to act as power financing strategy\n            adviser to the Government and the sector; and to enhance\n            FEN's image in the domestic capital market and thus\n            help facilitate its access to future savings."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Power Development Finance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Power Development\n            Finance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/06/10058529/colombia-power-development-finance-project","projn":"CO-Fen Power - A Loan -- P006783","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"m,Access to Finance,Debt Markets,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20081127012341"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other power and energy conversion","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Investment priorities;

development projects, which will supply\n            the electric energy needed to facilitate growth of\n            industrial and commercial activities, as well as help supply\n            electricity to a larger segment of the country's\n            population. The proposed project also seeks to support the\n            development of Fen, the recently-established financial arm\n            of the power sector, created to tap domestic and external\n            capital markets on its behalf. Support is provided under the\n            project to assist FEN in its role of strengthening power\n            sector financial management. The project consists of\n            subprojects representing a two-year time slice of priority\n            ongoing electricity development investments, several of\n            which are already partly financed with Bank loans. A group\n            of subprojects has been selected on a primary basis, with\n            final selection and sub-loan amounts to be based upon\n            detailed proposals in each case. Subprojects will consist of\n            a portion of the civil works, goods and services associated\n            with the investments and the proposed subloans to be made by\n            FEN to the utilities would finance foreign exchange costs\n            not covered by other sources."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
