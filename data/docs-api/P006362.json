The project's overall performance\n            and development impact were unsatisfactory. The\n            implementation for the components of the project was\n            unsatisfactory. The project did not reach key appraisal\n            targets during the period of non-disbursement. Where\n            progress was less than satisfactory, the lack of performance\n            was partly due to circumstances created by the changing\n            Federal Administrations and financial/economic conditions\n            within the government of Brazil (GOB) which placed less\n            priority on this sector and the completion of this project.\n            Lessons learned from the project were: (a) Appraisal and the\n            early stages of implementation did not pay enough attention\n            to GOB's commitment to the project and its objectives;\n            (b) At appraisal, a project financing plan should carefully\n            evaluate the Government's ability -- and willingness --\n            to meet counterpart funding requirements; (c) The ability of\n            executing agencies to carry out complex engineering works\n            and involve beneficiaries in the execution of sub-projects\n            at the local level should be evaluated at appraisal and\n            monitored during implementation; (d) When rehabilitation\n            work is contemplated, experienced specialists in this area\n            should be used; (e) The provision of good irrigation systems\n            is not sufficient to cause an increase in crop yields,\n            change cropping patterns, or improve irrigation techniques;\n            (f) In an environment of legal, bureaucratic and\n            institutional weakness, technical assistance and support for\n            institution building are necessary conditions to improve the\n            performance of executing agencies; (g) As was the case for\n            this project, when two or more implementing agencies are\n            involved, successful implementation depends greatly on good\n            collaborative arrangements among them; (h) Confusing and\n            contradictory signals by the Bank can undermine a\n            borrower's ability to execute a project efficiently."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Upper and Middle Sao Francisco\n            Irrigation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Upper and Middle Sao\n            Francisco
