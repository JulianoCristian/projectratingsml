Both World Bank and\n            Borrower performances are considered satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned include the following: This project demonstrates the\n            Bank's catalytic role by providing scarce budget\n            support resources that are specifically linked to sectoral\n            policies. Much of the effectiveness of the policies\n            supported by the project reflect a project design that\n            tackled key priorities that had been clearly identified by\n            the interim administration of Kosovo and the Bank's\n            trasitional support strategy. Clear focus on limited\n            outcomes was crucial to achieve tangible results. Kosovo is\n            a good example of a post-conflict situation where particular\n            emphasis was put on selctivity of the activities the Bank\n            could support with limited resources. Ownership by the\n            interim administration was an absolutely necessary condition\n            to achieve proper selectivity and adequate prioritization of\n            conditionalities. Local consultation in which the Bank\n            played a key role were crucial given the early stages of the\n            interim administration's mandate in Kosovo. Frequent,\n            close, and intensive consultation with donor was critical."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -\n            Third Economic Assistance Grant to Support Private Sector\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of\n            Yugoslavia -
