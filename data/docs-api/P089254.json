The lessons\n            learned were: (1) Regional Training Plans (Plans Acad\u00e9miques\n            de Formation, PAFs) and Quality Action Plans (Plans d\u0092\n            actions de Qualit\u00e9, PAQs) were useful and effective\n            instruments in supporting innovative strategies and\n            approaches developed at the local level to improve the\n            quality of education. They were perceived as effective\n            instruments to achieve this objective. (2) School projects\n            strengthened the involvement of teachers in aspects of\n            school management. These projects introduced a culture of\n            planning and accountability. The improvements which included\n            providing clear guidelines related to quality education,\n            including its features, indicators that should be used to\n            measures quality aspects, and identifying processes for\n            identifying problems and implementing strategies were\n            critical for the project\u0092s successes. (3) It is crucial to\n            continue to provide support for classroom observations as a\n            way to improve teaching. This tool was an important\n            innovation in identifying the training needs of teachers.\n            (4) More training for teachers should focus on preparing\n            teachers to carry out activities to improve reading and\n            language skills. More activities within the PAFs and PAQs to\n            support the acquisition of reading and language skills\n            should be considered in the future as reading and mastery of\n            language are key tools for understanding the content of\n            other subjects (Math and Science). (5) Strong Government\n            commitment is crucial for the achievement of the project\n            development objective. In the case of Senegal, the\n            Government sustained this commitment by annually providing\n            resources to enable the implementation of policies and\n            activities and worked closely with the donors to harmonize\n            their financial support behind the country\u0092s defined\n            priorities. (6) Regular monitoring and evaluation of a\n            program or a project contributes to the achievement of\n            sought outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Senegal - Second Quality Education for All Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Senegal -
