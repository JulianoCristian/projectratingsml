Some lessons\n            learned included: fiscal decentralization and community\n            empowerment are necessary but not sufficient to promote\n            improved community management of natural resources. Science\n            and cutting-edge technology in hydrology cannot be\n            overemphasized: watershed development should balance\n            participation and science in its design and implementation.\n            Watershed development projects are a relevant response to\n            the needed increase in rainfed agricultural productivity in\n            India. Gram Panchayat Watershed Development Plan (GPWDP)\n            investments increased the water holding capacity, and\n            comprehensive watershed treatment at the micro-watershed\n            level, including reserve forests, has proven effective by\n            SLEM, in sustaining natural water source. Building on these\n            investments, Gramya I demonstrated the effectiveness of\n            rainwater conservation and harvesting in rainfed areas, when\n            combined with improved seeds and management practices. More\n            attempts must be made to quantify costs and benefits\n            relative to alternative interventions. Impact evaluation and\n            economic analyses of Gramya I quantified the relevant costs\n            and benefits accruing to the GPWDPs and by Watershed\n            Management Directorate

the Uttaranchal\n            Decentralized Watershed Development Project for India is to\n            improve the productive potential of natural resources and\n            increase incomes of rural inhabitants in selected watersheds\n            through socially inclusive, institutionally and\n            environmentally sustainable approaches. During Mid-Term\n            Review (MTR) based on the project performance and outputs,\n            the task team and the project agreed on enhanced focus and\n            activities like agri-business activities, increasing the\n            scope of work in the drainage line treatment and increasing\n            the scope of consultancy to carry out evaluations. Apart\n            from the above on technical grounds, due to unit cost\n            escalation and the impact of such escalations on the sub\n            projects and allied activities, has necessitated this\n            reallocation. The reallocation will adjust the surplus\n            resources available under the training budget (category 4B)\n            and Goods and services for sub-project (category-1), and is\n            in line with the implementation plan. These changes will\n            support the incremental operating cost and natural increase\n            in unit cost of agri-business activities. With this\n            reallocation overdraw in categories 5 and 6 will also be\n            regularized which was done in line with the implementation\n            plan and activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Data sheet"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India -
