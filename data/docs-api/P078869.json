Programmatic Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is rated satisfactory\n            with project sustainability likely. A key factor in the\n            successful outcome of this first operation was the\n            Government's strong commitment to the reform process in\n            the financial sector. With respect to macroeconomic\n            policies, the government has held firm in terms of its\n            commitment to lowering inflation. More stable inflation\n            during the past two years has contributed to lower\n            inflation-adjusted interest rates. The strong commitment of\n            the Implementing Agency, the Ministry of Finance, and the\n            high degree of cooperation of the Superintendency of Banking\n            were also conducive to the Program's satisfactory and\n            timely results. World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            both rated highly satisfactory. Findings and implications\n            for subsequent operations in this series included the\n            following: 1) By emphasizing legislative and regulatory\n            changes in the first Operation of a Programmatic series,\n            there are some benefits of scope in the design of\n            conditionality across various sub-sectors, followed by\n            greater attention to implementation and second generation\n            reforms in subsequent operations. 2) It is more difficult to\n            apply and enforce current international best practices than\n            to design them: Regulators were keen to begin enforcing new\n            market rate risk norms but had to provide detailed guidance\n            and await the building up of internal capacity and\n            competency n the supervised financial entities before the\n            process could be implemented in a successful manner. 3) The\n            design of new regulatory tools and the development of more\n            complex rules, as part of a financial sector reform program,\n            should depend on the commitment of the Government to provide\n            the resources to upgrade supervisory skills as well as on a\n            timetable for helping regulators become expert in\n            implementing new policies and procedures. 4) A solid\n            macroeconomic policy framework is essential for the\n            successful implementation of a financial sector reform\n            program; the Government's success in lowering inflation\n            and resuming growth during the past two years has helped to\n            stabilize the financial system. 5) The completion of a\n            comprehensive stocktaking study of the financial sector\n            emphasizing potential risks should provide an initial\n            perspective on the impact of recent financial sector reforms\n            and any future risks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -

of the\n            1999-2001 crisis, and to strengthen the government's\n            capacity to manage and mitigate weaknesses in the financial\n            system. A key aspect of the proposed program is the design\n            of a multi pronged effort to first dispose of the financial\n            system's residual loan assets by developing more agile\n            and modern financial instruments and fiduciary arrangements\n            to package, and sell loan assets. The project also aims to\n            strengthen and diversify the participation of the housing\n            mortgage market including improved access to finance for the\n            micro sector, as well as strengthening non bank financial\n            services, and securities institutions in the financial\n            system. The securitization industry will be further\n            developed to support bank asset sales, to provide more\n            liquidity to the mortgage industry, and to help develop the\n            capital markets. A reform of the entire securities\n            legislation will be conducted as part of the program's\n            second phase, to promote a more agile development of the\n            local capital market. This will involve reforming corporate\n            governance and disclosure standards as well as proper\n            criteria for securities industry participants."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
