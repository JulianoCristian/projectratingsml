Program 1, Programmatic Decentralization and\n            Competitiveness SAL, had the following ratings: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low to\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Program 2, Second PROGRAMATIC\n            REFORM FOR GROWTH Project had the following ratings:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            low to negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. Program 3, Third\n            Programmatic Decentralization and Competitiveness\n            Development Policy Loan had the following ratings: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low to\n            negligible, Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was satisfactory. The lessons learned\n            included: 1) Operations designed for middle income countries\n            with highly skilled government staff and were first\n            generation reforms have been already implemented, need to\n            place strong emphasis in building the program in a\n            participatory and consultative way. The achievements of the\n            DCDPL series can be attributed to a number of reasons: (a)\n            the reforms were not imposed by the Bank but rather demand\n            driven by the beneficiaries; (b) there was a consensus among\n            civil society in favor of decentralization; (c) there was a\n            strong lead agency in the MEF to spearhead the process; (d)\n            Peru drew from the Bank's global experience with\n            decentralization and competitiveness; (e) the reform program\n            was designed and implemented gradually; (f) Peru already had\n            the legal framework within which other reforms could be\n            implemented; and (g) the process of change was taken as a\n            national project; 2) The DCDPL series drew on a wide range\n            of analytical work undertaken by the Bank, as well as other\n            analytical work carried out by the Government or research\n            institutions; and 3) Another key lesson is that the program\n            had built in at the onset a degree of flexibility that\n            allowed accommodating to evolving priorities and needs of\n            the

Government,\n            through three specific objectives: 1) protection of the\n            country's fiscal sustainability during Peru's\n            transition to a more decentralized state; 2) strengthened\n            management, and fiscal capacity at sub-national levels,\n            towards the progressive increase in services delivery; and,\n            3) supporting the creation of improved regulatory and\n            investment environment climate, to increase the\n            country's competitiveness, with a strong focus on\n            export promotion, and regional development. While the\n            project will help reduce poverty through the promotion of a\n            fiscally sustained decentralization, and competitiveness\n            program, it is subject to two main risks: a) program\n            sustainability, and, b) macroeconomic stability. First, the\n            continuity of program policies is supported by a number of\n            other multilateral, and bilateral agencies, including the\n            Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), and the United\n            States Agency for International Development (USAID), and\n            Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), among others.\n            Moreover, the Bank has already begun discussions with\n            government officials, as well as potential presidential\n            candidates about possible follow-up operations to support\n            reforms in these areas. Second however, the combination of\n            higher than-expected government revenues, and the upcoming\n            election cycle could trigger expansive fiscal policies,\n            threatening macroeconomic stability and the country's\n            debt level. The consensus in Congress on the benefits of\n            fiscal discipline will limit increases in public sector\n            expenditures for the rest of this administration."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Peru - Third Programmatic Decentralization\n            and Competitiveness Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Peru - Third
