However, the effects of the country's\n            security situation, which affected program implementation,\n            should be taken into consideration. Despite the\n            government's success in implementing most of the agreed\n            reforms, not much progress was achieved towards poverty\n            reduction. Economic growth declined, with exports sliding\n            below the program's initial figures. The macroeconomic\n            situation can be expected to strengthen, as the security\n            situation improves, following the conflict resolve. The key\n            lessons convey that, program design should be kept simple,\n            in order to address few, but high priority issues, and if\n            circumstances require, the possibility to implement mid-term\n            revisions. The implementation of the public enterprise\n            reform component, slowed down the release of the\n            second/third tranches, causing tremendous hardship to the\n            Government. This could have been avoided through flexible\n            floating tranche arrangements, to be made available for\n            particular elements of the reform program, thus safeguarding\n            the overall financing plan. Program design should address\n            potential risks, inherent in its implementation,\n            particularly under political uncertainties. Hence, the\n            creation of social safety nets, employment schemes, etc.,\n            could reduce the potential for large scale civil unrest."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sierra Leone - Structural
