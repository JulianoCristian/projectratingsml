Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh\n            Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Fifth, Sixth, and\n            Seventh Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) Project for\n            Cape Verde were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory. One\n            key lesson that can be learned from this PRSC series is the\n            importance of the need for good indicators to evaluate the\n            success of the operation. Indicator data have to be\n            available and attributable to government actions, and\n            indicators should not simply restate prior actions. One\n            particular problem with development policy lending is that\n            institutional reform takes time to show effects. The\n            operation has also shown the need for strong M&E\n            systems. Even if indicators are attributable but data are\n            not available, necessary, evidence-based fine-tuning during\n            the operation as well as a thorough and fair evaluation upon\n            completion of the series is impossible. Investing in country\n            Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) capacity, where\n            requires, is crucial. Another lesson is that donor\n            harmonization can be achieved without surrendering\n            flexibility for individual institutions' development\n            assessments. In Cape Verde, the budget support group had a\n            common donor matrix, bundling clout in policy areas\n            considered key by all development partners (e.g. Public\n            Financial Management, or PFM reform). In other areas, donors\n            maintained flexibility and could focus on their specific\n            areas of expertise (e.g. the Portuguese focusing on housing\n            and the Bank on State-Owned Enterprise, or SOEs). Within the\n            Bank, this approach has found recognition and can be\n            recommended to other country units."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh\n

           Reduction Support Credit Program (PRSC VI) for Cape Verde is\n            to support the policy reforms and institutional development\n            necessary to foster sustained economic growth. The\n            Government of Cape Verde (GOCV) has made considerable\n            progress in achieving its reform objectives under both the\n            current and previous PRSC series and has completed all PRSC\n            benchmarks. Additionally, the government has met all\n            assessment criteria for the final review of its\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) Policy Support Instrument\n            (PSI). Cape Verde has built a solid reputation for good\n            governance and responsible fiscal policy: it ranks first in\n            the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) for\n            the Africa Region (Low Income Countries). From 2000 to 2008\n            the Cape Verdean economy enjoyed an average annual real\n            Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 6.5 percent. In\n            2007 Cape Verde graduated to Middle-Income Country (MIC)\n            status. According to the analysis that underpins the\n            proposed PRSC VI; fiscal deficits are expected to remain\n            high through 2012. These are largely the joint result of\n            adverse external conditions and the temporary acceleration\n            of public investment which reflects the strategy to take\n            advantage of the five-year window under which the government\n            can still tap concessional sources of financing, following\n            Cape Verde's graduation to MIC status. As the global\n            economy, and the Euro Zone in particular, recovers from its\n            current recession, the Cape Verdean economy should return to\n            a robust growth path, and, in this context, the\n            government's long-term macroeconomic stance remains\n            adequate. The current PRSC VI will enable the government to\n            maintain fiscal sustainability and continue its investment\n            program without curtailing social services or accumulating\n            an unsustainable debt burden."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cape Verde - Sixth Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cape Verde - Sixth Poverty\n
