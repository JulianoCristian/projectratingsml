Lessons learned included: 1)\n            The availability of medication in or near PHC facilities and\n            the provision of basic laboratory equipment significantly\n            increase patient utilization of PHC services, especially\n            among women and children, and improve patient satisfaction\n            with respect to access and quality of care; 2) Training of\n            specialist physicians in topics related to PHC and clinical\n            facilitation improves the knowledge of trainees; 3) While\n            project evaluation demonstrated in an unambiguous way the\n            positive effects of training on the improvement of medical\n            knowledge, it was less clear regarding the effect of\n            training on the use of new knowledge in clinical practice;\n            4) Rationalization plans related to physical infrastructure\n            and health personnel need concrete project resources,\n            activities and some type of conditionality in order to be\n            implemented; 5) High-level involvement from the government\n            side is a necessary ingredient for successful project\n            implementation. Government ownership not only leads to\n            better implemented projects but also and perhaps more\n            importantly, increases the probability of continuing with\n            the reform efforts after the completion of the project; 6)\n            Flexibility and prompt reaction from the Bank side during\n            project supervision facilitates successful project\n            implementation and ensures appropriate post-completion\n            arrangements and follow-up operations; 7) The development of\n            a comprehensive M&E system in project design assists in\n            demonstrating the connection between project activities and\n            outcomes and provides valuable input for follow-up\n            operations; and 8) Reaching out to a broad range of\n            stakeholders prevents the derailing of the health reform process."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -
