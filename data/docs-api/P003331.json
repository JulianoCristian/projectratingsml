Several\n            lessons are therefore drawn from the project. Institutional\n            reform entails not only, strong commitment from every level\n            of Government, but a constant reinforcement of how its\n            process will impact cultural change. Such procedural change\n            needs to be recognized as of the early stages in the project\n            design, and should as well include a clear management\n            structure, i.e., responsibilities, and accountability need\n            to be assigned at the design stage for project\n            implementation, coordination, and supervision.\n            Unfortunately, the framework prepared during project design\n            was too complex to overcome, and particularly difficult for\n            monitoring purposes. Further damaging factors, were the\n            economic downturn, and governance crisis which emerged at\n            the time of project approval. Nonetheless, the decision to\n            proceed with the project was correctly taken in spite of the\n            transpired unsatisfactory status of the project, an\n            appropriately taken risk to hopefully maintain the reform\n            process in the agricultural sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zimbabwe -

There are two components. The first,\n            Rationalization and  Effectiveness of Agricultural Services\n            and Policymaking, 1) supports the preparation and initial\n            implementation of sub-sectoral strategic plans by the\n            Ministry of Lands and Agriculture (MoLA) for agricultural\n            research, extension, and veterinary services; 2) facilitates\n            the planning, implementation, and evaluation of pilot\n            efforts to commercialize, out-source, or privatize selected\n            public agricultural services; 3) finances competitive and\n            collaborative research and advisory services that support\n            smallholder agriculture; 4) provides equipment to improve\n            effectiveness and client-responsiveness; and 5) finances\n            analysis and consensus-building on outstanding and emerging\n            policy issues. The second component, Efficient Resource\n            Management, improves MoLA's management of human\n            resources through training and reallocating and/or\n            retrenching selected staff; designs and implements improved\n            financial and accounting systems and practices and\n            decentralizes them; strengthens the use of information\n            technology; and
