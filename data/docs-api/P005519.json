Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) the LWMPP approach depended on active\n            community involvement, but was able to deliver goods and\n            services only after a long period of time. Establishing\n            credibility with farmers long accustomed to empty promises\n            requires that tangible rewards for their efforts commence as\n            soon as practicable following those efforts; 2) in a project\n            with substantial environmental objectives, and often complex\n            efficacy and efficiency treatment trade-offs, it is\n            important to measure at least local environmental impacts.\n            This data may later be modeled into broader environmental\n            impacts as treatment coverage spreads; 3) actively including\n            non-governmental organization (NGO) in participatory\n            projects can increase sustainability of project activities.\n            This is especially true if NGOs continue project activities\n            after the project closes, as was the case in the LWMPP; and\n            4) local authorities need to be involved in sub-project\n            planning from the start. Otherwise the project will create\n            parallel structures to the local government that weakens the\n            government rather than strengthening it."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Lakhdar Watershed Management Pilot Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco -

Among the lessons cited were these: 1) Local\n            community organizations must emerge and, to be viable, must\n            evolve into legal entities with some level of financial\n            autonomy. Their promotion should therefore be part of the\n            project thrusts. 2)Participation requires implementing\n            agencies staff to be trained, organized and able to explain\n            the project's objective and implementation mechanisms\n            to all the stakeholders, gain their confidence and establish\n            partnerships. Frequent staff turnover should be avoided. 3)\n            Partnerships with specialized nongovernmental organizations\n            and micro-credit agencies afford good chances for providing\n            the necessary technical and financial support for project\n            activities. 4) Early involvement and support of regional and\n            local authorities is a key to success. 5) Communities are\n            willing to participate when they see tangible benefits and\n            the possibility of generating added income from project\n            activities. Project staff should therefore put emphasis on\n            the need for natural resource conservation and management as\n            a condition for sustainable development and growth. 6)\n            Participatory projects experience slow disbursements during\n            the first year or two because of their slow take-off. They\n            subsequently have low levels of disbursements because of the\n            small size of most community investments; the limited\n            implementation capacity of emerging community organizations;\n            and the scarcity of consulting firms and enterprises to work\n            on small projects in remote rural areas.7) Land tenure\n            issues affect participant's incentives and can\n            seriously hamper implementation of any rural development project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco - Lakhdar Watershed Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Morocco - Lakhdar Watershed\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/06/6036665/morocco-lakhdar-watershed-management-project","projn":"MA-Lakhdar Watershed Mg -- P005519","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","count":"Morocco","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20050630093641"},"admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Roads and highways,General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development, agricultural\n            production, Agriculture, average yields, basic\n            infrastructure, Beneficiary participation, breeding,\n            catchment, cereal crops, cereals, communities, community\n            organizations, community participation, crops,\n            Decentralization, decision making, degradation,\n            Desertification, development projects, economic benefits,\n            Education, environmental impact, equipment, erosion control,\n            erosion management, Exchange Rate, exploitation, extension,\n            farmers, feasibility studies, feed, field days, financial\n            management, financial resources, firewood, fishing, fodder,\n            forest, forest land, forest management, forest product,\n            forestry, forestry activities, Forestry Department, forestry\n            management, forestry sector, Forests, funding mechanisms,\n            Health, health education, implementing agencies, income,\n            incomes, insurance, integration, irrigation, irrigation\n            systems, Land administration, land clearing, land\n            degradation, land improvement, land tenure, land tenure\n            problems, land use, lands, lentils, Lessons Learned, Lessons\n            learnt, livestock, local authorities, local communities,\n            local contractors, marketing, Middle East, Natural Resource,\n            natural resource base, natural resource conservation,\n            Natural Resource Management, Natural Resources, Natural\n            Resources Management, NGOs, nongovernmental organizations,\n            nutrition, outreach, participatory approaches, pastures,\n            planting, population growth, potatoes, Present Value,\n            procurement, procurement procedures, productivity, Project\n            Appraisal, project implementation, project preparation,\n            public services, rural communities, Rural Development, rural\n            roads, soil erosion, soils, sustainable development, tree\n            plantations, trees, WATERSHED, WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, wheat"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Water & Environ Group (MNSRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF026620-PHRD -NATIONAL WATERSHED\n            MANAGEMENT PROJ,TF029346-PHRD-RURAL POVERTY REDUCT.&\n            ENVIRON.

There are three\n            components. The first consists of soil and water\n            conservation and erosion control measures carried out with\n            the active participation of the communities concerned on\n            public, collective, and private lands. These measures\n            include 1) protecting gullies and ravines on all lands,\n            improving range lands in degraded sylvopastoral lands, and\n            revegetating badlands progressively; 2) funding\n            participative forest management with pilot operations to\n            regularize illicit settlements, reforesting, and improving\n            socio-economic infrastructure; 3) rehabilitating small-scale\n            irrigation systems; and 4) intensifying irrigated and\n            rain-fed crop production, planting fruit trees, and\n            sponsoring field demonstrations and farmers' days. The\n            second component, socio-economic infrastructure, finances\n            access roads, water supply schemes, and technical studies.\n            The third component finances four-wheel drive vehicles,\n            office furniture and equipment including computer equipment,\n            and a training program for project staff, elected\n            representatives, and local administration officials."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Morocco -
