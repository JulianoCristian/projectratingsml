As per the Emergency Recovery and Disaster\n            Management Program (ERDMP) Project, the audit largely\n            concurs with the ICR ratings of a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, substantial institutional\n            development impacts, and satisfactory performances by both\n            the Bank and Borrower. Lessons of experience are suggested\n            as follows. The Bank needs to be more involved in the\n            immediate post-emergency period, and it needs to be able to\n            quickly fund activities that do not require detailed\n            preparation, but it needs to take the necessary time to\n            prepare infrastructure rehabilitation components that\n            require careful attention to design. The experience of these\n            two projects illustrates the perils of inadequate attention\n            to design, including taking into account the motivation and\n            perceptions of key stakeholders. In the absence of borrower\n            staff experienced in Bank procurement practices, early\n            training and support needs to be provided, especially under\n            the time pressures that are normal for emergency operations.\n            Specifically, when intervening in the natural behavior of a\n            river, it should be realized that there is a danger of\n            triggering unexpected and negative effects. For this reason\n            it is sometimes preferable to keep land adjoining rivers\n            free of construction, and to allow the river to have some\n            freedom of movement. Moreover, in order to work out a\n            feasible action plan for watershed and environmental\n            management it is imperative to identify the main constraints\n            hampering sound management. In St. Lucia, constraints have\n            included turf issues between relevant public institutions,\n            the movement of farming to the hillsides, the nature of\n            local crops, and local perceptions of hazards (causes and\n            remedies). Therefore, with adequate preparation,\n            infrastructure can be rebuilt in three years, but creating\n            viable institutions at the national, district, and community\n            level takes much longer. Grappling with well entrenched\n            environmental bad practice is even more challenging and time-consuming."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Saint Lucia - Watershed and Environmental\n            Management, and, Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management\n            Program Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Saint Lucia -

Emergency Recovery and\n            Disaster Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project performance ratings are as\n            follows: Outcome is satisfactory, sustainability is likely,\n            institutional development impact is substantial, and the\n            performances of both the Bank and the Borrower are\n            satisfactory. These are some of the lessons learned: 1)\n            Planning the project more deliberately as a standard\n            investment loan would have enabled better preparation of\n            procurement and institutional arrangements before appraisal.\n            2) Procurement planning must be done from the beginning. In\n            addition, it would have been preferable to have drawings,\n            specifications and terms of reference for the first year of\n            implementation prepared before appraisal. Modum operandi\n            between the Project Coordination Unit and the implementing\n            agencies should be written in the operational manual. 3)\n            Gabion works for slope stabilization and riverbank\n            protection proved to be an effective, easy and\n            labor-intensive way to implement mitigation works. 4) It\n            would have been preferable to process the various\n            loan/credit for the different OECS countries as separate\n            projects part of a broader program, but not integrated into\n            one horizontal APL. In the Bank system, APL phases each\n            correspond to one project (i.e. with one Project\n            Identification Number (P0 number)) which does not allow for\n            a segregation of reporting and accounting on individual\n            sub-projects. The task team had important problem at the\n            beginning of the program to obtain differentiated P0 number\n            for each country. 5) Reconstruction components often require\n            careful assessment and long term effort that generally\n            extends beyond the normal three year implementation period\n            for Bank-assisted emergency operations. Therefore, priority\n            in this type of projects should be given to prevention,\n            immediate measures to reactivate economic activity and\n            careful assessment of longer-term reconstruction priorities\n            and designs. 6) Ad hoc implementation arrangements through\n            Project Coordination Units need to be carefully considered.\n            In projects lacking a critical mass of work it is difficult\n            for governments to allocate enough of their scarce qualified\n            manpower to these units. 7) Terms of Reference for\n            consulting engineers need to specify government budget\n            constraints to avoid over-designed infrastructure that will\n            be unaffordable to implement. The Bank needs to consider\n            requiring performance guarantees of consultants and applying\n            penalties for late submissions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Saint Lucia - Emergency Recovery
