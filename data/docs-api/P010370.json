Consistent with the findings of\n            the Quality Assurance Group, the project failed to achieve\n            most of its major objectives, largely because the Nepal\n            Water Supply Corporation was subject to tight government\n            controls, with detrimental turnover at the board, and senior\n            management, thus the objective of strengthening\n            institutional capability was not met. Neither were the\n            physical objectives by closing time. Among the lessons drawn\n            from the project, it is specified that the Bank's\n            failure to identify key weaknesses, and to act decisively to\n            relieve adversity, contributed to the negative results. But\n            the single most failure of both the Bank, and Government,\n            was the lack of institutional autonomy, needed to reduce\n            political interference in management practices. Investment\n            sequencing in physical infrastructure, and technical\n            assistance should be measurable, and conditional to the\n            achievement of agreed institutional performance, an approach\n            being followed in sector dialogues. Furthermore, procurement\n            impaired project outcomes, due to consistent delays,\n            difficulties in preparing pre-qualification documents, and,\n            weak evaluating criteria. However, the reduction in water\n            losses proved successful in the management of unaccounted\n            for water, but commitment is needed for a lasting leak\n            detection
