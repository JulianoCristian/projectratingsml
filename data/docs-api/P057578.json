It was formed in May\n            1969, as a state enterprise wholly-owned by the Kingdom. The\n            currency crisis in Thailand has had an adverse impact on the\n            financial health of the Thai electricity utilities. Before\n            the crisis, EGAT's financial position was sound.\n            Following the crisis (with the exchange rate going up from\n            about Baht 25/US$ to more than Baht 50/US$ and thereafter\n            stabilizing at around Baht 40/US$), EGAT suffered heavy\n            foreign exchange losses. The Government adjusted the tariff\n            from April 1, 1998 to offset partially the impact of\n            devaluation. Consequently, there was a need to improve\n            EGAT's financial position and to remove the serious\n            constraints EGAT faced in meeting the financing requirements\n            of its ongoing investment program. The financing gap was\n            further aggravated by EGAT's inability to access long\n            term financing in the capital markets because of perceived\n            higher country risk, the Asian crisis and the collapse of\n            the domestic debt market. The Government, in consultation\n            with the Bank, decided that part of the financial resources\n            required for EGAT should be mobilized from the capital\n            markets and not just by continuing the Bank lending program.\n            To meet EGAT's urgent funding need, a 10-year bond\n            issue was structured with the World Bank covering the\n            principal and a single coupon payment on a rolling basis.\n            Originally, This Note describes the conditions of the World\n            Bank guarantee and the benefits accruing to EGAT."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand: EGAT paves the way : World Bank\n            guarantees EGAT bonds"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand: EGAT paves the way :\n            World Bank guarantees EGAT bonds"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/1999/01/6742951/thailand-egat-paves-way-world-bank-guarantees-egat-bonds","projn":"TH-Egat-Inv Prog Sup Pj -- P057578","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Financial Crisis Management & Restructuring,Financial Intermediation,Corporate Law,Infrastructure Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Law and Development","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20060421115642"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","colti":"Project finance and guarantees notes","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Infrastructure Economics and Finance,Law and Development","prdln":"Guarantees","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Energy and mining","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"bank deposits, Bank Guarantees, Bank\n            lending, Bank of Thailand, Banks, bond issue, bond issues,\n            Bond markets, Capital Flows, capital markets,\n            commercialization, company, Cost of Capital, credit ratings,\n            debt, deposits, Discount rate, financial assets, financial\n            crisis, financial institutions, financial intermediation,\n            financial markets, financial viability, foreign currency\n            debt, foreign exchange, generation, independent power\n            producers, Insurance, interest rates, international\n            reserves, investment program, liquidity, managers, market\n            discipline, maturities, partial credit guarantee, power,\n            power producers, power sector, present value, Private\n            Capital, privatization, privatization process, public\n            sector, rating agencies, Resource Mobilization, rolling\n            basis, speculative attacks, state enterprise, state\n            enterprises, takeover, trading, utilities"}},"owner":"IDA Resource Mobilization (DFIRM),Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"35893"},"440784":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/08/440784/thailand-egat-investment-program-support-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1998/08/440784/thailand-egat-investment-program-support-project","new_url":"1998/08/440784/thailand-egat-investment-program-support-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/17/000009265_3980929145931/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1999/09/17/000009265_3980929145931/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","datestored":"1999-09-17T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1998-08-12T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Thailand - EGAT Investment Program Support Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The main development objectives of the\n            EGAT - Investment Program Support Project are to: a) help\n            the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) meet\n            its essential investment commitments on generation and\n            transmission projects whose implementation has already been\n            under way; b) help EGAT not lose ground in accomplishing its\n            organizational restructuring and corporatization, and\n            implementing its privatization strategy and c) help improve\n            the regulatory framework for the energy sector.

In terms of air quality, the impact of dust during\n            construction will be mitigated by water sprays. Emissions\n            from construction equipment and vehicular transportation\n            will be controlled by reducing vehicular speed. Sulfur\n            Dioxide will be controlled by an 80 percent efficient Flue\n            Gas Desulfurization System (FGD). Major construction\n            activities will be conducted in dry seasons to reduce\n            siltation to the nearby rivers. Water quality affected by\n            suspended solid in the nearby river will be improved by\n            constructing temporary weir to trap sediment. Salt water\n            intrusion into the groundwater will be mitigated by\n            controlling the discharge rate and exploring other water\n            resources. Noise pollution will be minimized by using noise\n            control equipment, creating noise barriers, and publicizing\n            the time for blasting.

A screening structure will be placed at\n            the inlet of the intake pipe at the water intake pump\n            station so that young fish, fish eggs, and floating weeds\n            will not be pumped into the intake."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - EGAT Investment Program Support\n            Project : environmental assessment summary"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - EGAT Investment\n            Program Support Project : environmental assessment summary\n            (Vol. 12)"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1998/07/441977/thailand-egat-investment-program-support-project-environmental-assessment-summary-vol-12","projn":"TH-Egat-Inv Prog Sup Pj -- P057578","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Sanitation and Sewerage,Water and Industry,Airports and Air Services,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,TF030632-DANISH CTF - FY05 (DAC PART\n            COUNTRIES GNP PER CAPITA BELOW USD 2,500/AL","teratopic":"Water Resources,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980901160936"},"subsc":"Power","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English,Thai","historic_topic":"Water Resources,Transport,Water Supply and Sanitation","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accident,AIR POLLUTION,air quality,aquatic\n            ecology,Arsenic,BOD,chlorination,construction,construction\n            activities,construction period,Control\n            System,cooling,cooling water,Copper,DRAINAGE,Effluent\n            Quality,ELECTRICITY,Emissions,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT,Environmental Impact\n            Assessments,Environmental Monitoring,Environmental\n            Quality,FEEDWATER,fire,Flood Control,Fuel,FUEL\n            CONSUMPTION,Gas,Grease,groundwater,GROUNDWATER\n            QUALITY,HEAT,Land Use,leak detection,LIME,local\n            authorities,local communities,local community,Monitoring\n            Program,Navigation,neutralization,noise,pH,piping,plantations,PM,POLLUTION,POLLUTION\n            CONTROL,pond,power station,public health,Public\n            Participation,pumps,Raw water,RELATIVE\n            HUMIDITY,RIVER,safety,ships,solid waste,solid waste\n            management,storage tanks,surface water,surface water\n            quality,TAg,tanks,Technical information,THERMAL\n            POWER,Tower,waste collection,waste\n            management,WASTEWATER,WASTEWATER TREATMENT,WASTEWATER\n            TREATMENT SYSTEM,Water Demand,water quality,Water\n            Quantity,WATER SUPPLY,Water Treatment,WATER USE"},"1":{"cdata!":"accident,AIR POLLUTION,air quality,aquatic\n            ecology,Arsenic,BOD,chlorination,construction,construction\n            activities,construction period,Control\n            System,cooling,cooling water,Copper,DRAINAGE,Effluent\n            Quality,ELECTRICITY,Emissions,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            IMPACT,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT,Environmental Impact\n            Assessments,Environmental Monitoring,Environmental\n            Quality,FEEDWATER,fire,Flood Control,Fuel,FUEL\n            CONSUMPTION,Gas,Grease,groundwater,GROUNDWATER\n            QUALITY,HEAT,Land Use,leak detection,LIME,local\n            authorities,local communities,local community,Monitoring\n            Program,Navigation,neutralization,noise,pH,piping,plantations,PM,POLLUTION,POLLUTION\n            CONTROL,pond,power station,public health,Public\n            Participation,pumps,Raw water,RELATIVE\n            HUMIDITY,RIVER,safety,ships,solid waste,solid waste\n            management,storage tanks,surface water,surface water\n            quality,TAg,tanks,Technical information,THERMAL\n            POWER,Tower,waste collection,waste\n            management,WASTEWATER,WASTEWATER TREATMENT,WASTEWATER\n            TREATMENT SYSTEM,Water Demand,water quality,Water\n            Quantity,WATER SUPPLY,Water Treatment,WATER USE"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"E235"},"facets":{}}}
