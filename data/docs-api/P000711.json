Some of the lessons\n            learned from the project are: 1) the continuous monitoring\n            by the Government high-level committees was instrumental in\n            facilitating and expediting implementation. Such close\n            monitoring efforts by Ministry of Health (MOH) had a\n            salutary effect on project implementation, and will in the\n            long run have a beneficial impact in achieving and\n            sustaining development objectives; 2) the need to strengthen\n            capacity building activities. The absence of institutional\n            capacity, particularly in some of the regions, was found to\n            be an impediment; and will continue to be so unless\n            additional attention is given to providing carefully planned\n            training in various areas, including procurement,\n            disbursement and contract management. In addition,\n            government policies that provide incentives to recruit and\n            maintain the services of trained and competent staff are\n            needed; and 3) the need to balance facility expansion with\n            quality measures. Although the completion of civil works is\n            commendable, the quality of construction was frequently a\n            cause for concern. Also, it is essential that the\n            procurement of equipment, furniture and supplies coincide as\n            closely as possible with the expected date(s) of completion\n            of the construction activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -
