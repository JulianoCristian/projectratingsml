Lastly, they include (c) carrying out a\n            management efficiency study and a program to introduce\n            modern systems for organization, information and cost\n            management at fertilizer enterprises, and upgrade\n            sector-wide management training capabilities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Fertilizer Rationalization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Fertilizer\n            Rationalization Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1987/05/742027/china-fertilizer-rationalization-project","projn":"CN-Fertilizer II -- P003469","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Fertilizers,Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals Industry,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926083203"},"subsc":"(Historic)Fertilizer and other chemicals","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Industry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agriculture,ammonia,Animal\n            Husbandry,arable land,Benefit Streams,Carbon,Carbon\n            Dioxide,chemical fertilizers,Chemical Industry,coal,Complex\n            Fertilizers,Cotton,crop,crops,cultivated land,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic value,Energy Consumption,energy\n            efficiency,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            PROTECTION,equipment,exploitation,farm,farmers,farming,feasibility\n            studies,Fertilizer,fertilizer application,fertilizer\n            consumption,Fertilizer Industry,fertilizer\n            manufacturing,Fertilizer Plants,fertilizer prices,fertilizer\n            production,Fertilizer Use,Fertilizers,Financial\n            Management,Fisheries,Foodgrains,grain,grain\n            production,Imports,industrial crops,Insurance,local\n            authorities,Marketing,mines,oil,organic\n            fertilizers,phosphate fertilizers,Pollution,Pollution\n            Levels,potash fertilizers,produce,producers,product\n            quality,production activities,production planning,proven\n            reserves,quotas,Streams,urea,urea plants,yields"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural output,agricultural\n            production,agricultural products,Agriculture,ammonia,Animal\n            Husbandry,arable land,Benefit Streams,Carbon,Carbon\n            Dioxide,chemical fertilizers,Chemical Industry,coal,Complex\n            Fertilizers,Cotton,crop,crops,cultivated land,ECONOMIC\n            ANALYSIS,economic value,Energy Consumption,energy\n            efficiency,ENVIRONMENTAL\n            PROTECTION,equipment,exploitation,farm,farmers,farming,feasibility\n            studies,Fertilizer,fertilizer application,fertilizer\n            consumption,Fertilizer Industry,fertilizer\n            manufacturing,Fertilizer Plants,fertilizer prices,fertilizer\n            production,Fertilizer Use,Fertilizers,Financial\n            Management,Fisheries,Foodgrains,grain,grain\n            production,Imports,industrial crops,Insurance,local\n            authorities,Marketing,mines,oil,organic\n            fertilizers,phosphate fertilizers,Pollution,Pollution\n            Levels,potash fertilizers,produce,producers,product\n            quality,production activities,production planning,proven\n            reserves,quotas,Streams,urea,urea plants,yields"}},"owner":"China & Mongolia HQ Unit (EACCQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"repnb":"6662"},"facets":{}}}
