Some key\n            lessons learned are the following: Although the\n            project's Staff Appraisal Report reflected most of the\n            objectives in the Borrower's Letter of Sector\n            Development Policy, IDA's wording of the objectives\n            assigns higher priority to reform actions, while the LODP\n            appears to emphasize more the physical extension of the\n            system. Before proceeding with any restructuring or\n            privatization operation, there must be internal government\n            consensus on the objectives, detailed actions required, and\n            scheduling of activities. A permanent private management\n            contract for a utility may not be effective unless the\n            private operator has full responsibility for the power\n            system and does not have to depend on government actions to\n            make the utility commercially viable. Supervision in the\n            project's initial years was minimal despite the\n            emphasis of the project's implementation plan on close\n            supervision. Consequently there was a major loss in project\n            momentum at the outset."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Second Energy Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Second Energy Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1999/08/728507/guinea-second-energy-project","projn":"GN-Power Ii -- P001043","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Energy Technology & Transmission,Rural Portfolio Improvement,Economic Theory & Research,Power & Energy Conversion","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_9909231153581"},"subsc":"Oil and gas,Central government administration,Power","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to\n            electricity,actions,air,availability of\n            power,blackouts,consumers,contractual\n            arrangements,development objectives,economic rate of\n            return,electric power,electricity generation,energy\n            data,Energy Department,energy development,energy\n            efficiency,energy planning,energy policy,energy\n            resource,energy resources,energy sector,Environmental\n            Objectives,improvements,institutional\n            development,laws,macroeconomic adjustment,Marginal\n            Cost,Natural Resources,Operations,partnership,performance\n            indicators,physical development,pollution,Power,power\n            company,power development,Power Engineering,power\n            plant,power plants,power sector,power supply,power\n            system,private sector,Project,PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION,public\n            sector,regulatory framework,Report,rural\n            electrification,rural energy,social\n            objectives,supervision,Sustainability,technical assistance,telecommunications"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to\n            electricity,actions,air,availability of\n            power,blackouts,consumers,contractual\n            arrangements,development objectives,economic rate of\n            return,electric power,electricity generation,energy\n            data,Energy Department,energy development,energy\n            efficiency,energy planning,energy policy,energy\n            resource,energy resources,energy sector,Environmental\n            Objectives,improvements,institutional\n            development,laws,macroeconomic adjustment,Marginal\n            Cost,Natural Resources,Operations,partnership,performance\n            indicators,physical development,pollution,Power,power\n            company,power development,Power Engineering,power\n            plant,power plants,power sector,power supply,power\n            system,private sector,Project,PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION,public\n            sector,regulatory framework,Report,rural\n            electrification,rural energy,social\n            objectives,supervision,Sustainability,technical assistance,telecommunications"}},"owner":"Energy Practice 1 (AFTG1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF028065-CANADIAN CONSLT.
