Lessons learned or reconfirmed\n            include: 1) Achieving institutional changes, such as those\n            required for financial management and human resource\n            modernization, require a long time horizon to take root and\n            yield fruit. This in turn requires a long-term commitment,\n            consistency, and continuity of approach and support on the\n            part of both the World Bank and the government. 2)\n            Comprehensive diagnostic work should be completed during the\n            project design to provide a clear basis for implementation\n            planning and targeting, to ensure that the proper linkages\n            are established among project components, and to help ensure\n            that mechanisms are in place to facilitate high level\n            government support. 3) Suitable human resource policies and\n            mechanisms should be devised to ensure that staff remain in\n            positions for which they have been trained for a reasonable\n            period; and that the compensation system, at least for\n            highly skilled jobs, is such that qualified persons can be\n            attracted and retained in public service. 4) Rapid changes\n            in information technology necessitate continuous upgrading\n            of computer systems. 5) Local ownership of reforms is\n            imperative for their success. 6) Finally, institutional\n            change is facilitated by early successes and by gaining\n            public support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Financial and Program Management\n            Improvement
