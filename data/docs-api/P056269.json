Lessons of experience\n            are expressed as follows. Particularly during crisis\n            situations, project design should take into account the\n            speed with which assistance can be delivered, i.e., complex\n            structures and processes that slow activities, and\n            disbursements should be avoided, and agencies should have a\n            clear understanding of the requirements involved with Bank\n            operations. It is reinforced that during project\n            preparation, an up-front assessment of implementing agency\n            capacity is needed. Such an assessment, although\n            time-consuming, would help inform project design, and the\n            development of a realistic timeline, as well as identify\n            necessary technical assistance to ensure a smooth project\n            implementation. Under a crisis situation, or emergency\n            operation, in particular, the Bank must provide substantial\n            on-the-job training and assistance at the beginning of the\n            operation, which would likely require higher than the norm\n            budget allocations. Likewise, the structure of a\n            crisis-response project should allow sufficient flexibility\n            to accommodate changing circumstances, and provide\n            incentives to help mitigate risk. A focus on outcomes, both\n            in design and supervision, is critical in determining\n            whether a project is delivering the intended results, and\n            whether adjustments are required. To this end, indicators\n            should move beyond tracking outputs (i.e. number of\n            trainees, number of roads constructed) to analyzing the\n            quality and impact of such achievements (i.e. employment\n            gained as a result of training, sustainability and benefits\n            of infrastructure created). The challenge of developing\n            measurable indicators for community empowerment, social\n            capital, and capacity building objectives must also be addressed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand -
