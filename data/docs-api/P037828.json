Lessons\n            learned from the project: Project experience showed that a\n            skillful and dedicated Project Management Unit, with\n            appropriate political support and capable of establishing\n            and maintaining a dialogue with the various executing\n            agencies, is essential to successful implementation. The use\n            of micro-catchments as planning units was a key to success.\n            A high quality comprehensive project manual is essential in\n            order to guide and coordinate activities. It was very\n            important for poor beneficiaries to buy-in to the\n            implementation of subprojects through family labor or other\n            contributions as it serves to create a sense of ownership.\n            On-time provision of counterpart funds with strict\n            compliance with the amounts included in annual budgets has\n            proved to be vital for effective implementation of this type\n            of project. When a project is faced with frequent changes in\n            administration, it is important for the Bank to conduct an\n            intense schedule of supervision missions. Natural resources\n            management, rural poverty alleviation and income generation\n            in very poor communities should always include an effective\n            process of participatory and decentralized planning. A\n            highly decentralized structure, including regional\n            commissions working closely with municipal councils, acting\n            like their advisors and articulating activities with project\n            management units are very important to create an efficient\n            flow of subprojects. The availability of sound project\n            management tools like SAFF and highly skilled professional\n            services backing this information system has been very\n            important in terms of the performance of the Project\n            Implementation Unit."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
