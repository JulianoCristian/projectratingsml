The\n            project achieved its objectives, which were clearly defined,\n            and relevant to national policies, most importantly, it laid\n            the foundation for greater self-reliance of polytechnics,\n            and for partnerships with industry, and community, in the\n            management, and financing of polytechnics. Among the many\n            lessons learned, the project re-enforced the importance of\n            full ownership, and commitments of the States, in tandem\n            with Government policy support, since the effective central\n            coordination promoted competition, facilitated a responsive\n            management, and further enhanced industrial participation in\n            manpower development. But regardless of a proven effective\n            decentralization, special attention by the Bank, should be\n            given to local implementing agencies, particularly in\n            providing technical assistance at the early stages of the\n            project. It is important to record, and maintain a system\n            for a timely flow of funds, and disbursements, to\n            systematically release funds, such as a line allocation to\n            the project account, which could have reduced the delays\n            faced in civil works, and procurement. The intense\n            field-based supervision allowed a close interaction with the\n            Borrower, and beneficiaries, which proved to be not only\n            effective, but economical as well."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second Technician Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second Technician\n            Education Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/06/728964/india-second-technician-education-project","projn":"IN-Second Technician Education Project -- P009988","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00080305305981"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Vocational training,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,active\n            participation,addition,additional funds,additional\n            resources,comprehensive program,computer skills,continuing\n            education,curricula,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,disadvantaged groups,distance\n            education,Drawing,dropout rates,Education Programs,Education\n            Projects,Education Sector,employment,employment\n            opportunities,enrollment,female enrollment,formative\n            evaluation,full participation,housing,implementation\n            strategies,Institutional\n            Development,intervention,interventions,leadership,Learning,Learning\n            Resources,lectures,libraries,manuals,mass\n            media,media,mid-term review,national policies,negative\n            impact,papers,partnership,performance\n            indicators,principals,Public Sector,Quality Assurance,rural\n            areas,scholarships,Schools,Secondary Education,staff\n            development,student performance,student\n            places,teacher,teacher education,Teachers,teaching,teaching\n            staff,Technical Education,textbooks,Training\n            Institutes,training programs,Vocational Education,Vocational\n            Training,workers,working conditions"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,achievements,active\n            participation,addition,additional funds,additional\n            resources,comprehensive program,computer skills,continuing\n            education,curricula,curriculum,curriculum\n            development,decentralization,disadvantaged groups,distance\n            education,Drawing,dropout rates,Education Programs,Education\n            Projects,Education Sector,employment,employment\n            opportunities,enrollment,female enrollment,formative\n            evaluation,full participation,housing,implementation\n            strategies,Institutional\n            Development,intervention,interventions,leadership,Learning,Learning\n            Resources,lectures,libraries,manuals,mass\n            media,media,mid-term review,national policies,negative\n            impact,papers,partnership,performance\n            indicators,principals,Public Sector,Quality Assurance,rural\n            areas,scholarships,Schools,Secondary Education,staff\n            development,student performance,student\n            places,teacher,teacher education,Teachers,teaching,teaching\n            staff,Technical Education,textbooks,Training\n            Institutes,training programs,Vocational Education,Vocational\n            Training,workers,working conditions"}},"owner":"S.A.

The main objectives\n            include: capacity expansion which would be achieved by\n            expanding and diversifying programs in about 240 new and\n            existing institutions, so that they can undertake with\n            flexibility, courses in new and emerging technologies,\n            conventional and advanced technician engineering, and\n            continuing education diploma courses.  Special attention\n            will also be given to expanding and improving training\n            opportunities for women, rural populations and the informal\n            sector by establishing new women's residential\n            polytechnics, upgrading coeducational polytechnics to create\n            more opportunities for women, and expanding the number of\n            community polytechnics.  Quality improvement will be\n            achieved through modernizing the equipment and facilities of\n            polytechnics, expanding and improving the quality of\n            training of polytechnic teachers and undertaking curriculum\n            development activities.  Efficiency improvement will result\n            from strengthening state directorates and boards of\n            technical education, granting academic autonomy to selected\n            polytechnics, undertaking industry-institute interaction\n            programs in each polytechnic, encouraging internal revenue\n            generation in polytechnics and establishing equipment and\n            facility maintenance systems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -
