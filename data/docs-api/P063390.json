The lessons\n            learned in this second adjustment operation confirm the\n            lessons learned in the Contractual Savings Structural\n            Adjustment Loan Project. The lessons are as follows: 1) In\n            preparing complex sector adjustment operations, the Bank\n            should lead with its comparative advantage which is bringing\n            to bear strong technical capacity and ample cross-country\n            experience. The Borrower must be confident that its dialogue\n            with the Bank will be of added value to its own efforts. 2)\n            In designing a sector adjustment loan, political factors and\n            the legislative needs of the client need to be understood\n            and included in the dialogue with the client, particularly\n            in an election year. 3) Rather than risk delays and failure\n            in the achievement of the program's long term aims by\n            locking the client into an overly ambitious and politically\n            sensitive policy agenda, the Bank should choose to negotiate\n            a medium-term reform strategy, and allocate its reform goals\n            over a series of single-tranche adjustment operations - a\n            lending vehicle designed specifically to protect the\n            integrity of lengthy adjustment operations from significant\n            political shifts in borrowing countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Uruguay -

sector reform program aiming at 1) improving\n            competition in the banking sector establishing a more level\n            playing field between public and private banks; 2)\n            strengthening banking regulation, supervision, and\n            inspection; 3) restructuring public banks; 4) assisting in\n            the privatization of a bank under public management; 5)\n            introducing more transparency in the financial sector; and\n            6) assisting in the modernization of the financial\n            sector's legal framework. The loan will be disbursed in\n            one tranche, upon loan effectiveness. The Bank's\n            strategy is to support incremental policy improvements in\n            the financial sector, while continuing the dialogue and\n            technical work needed to ensure consensus on more far\n            reaching financial sector reforms in the future. To\n            accelerate the pace of policy reform in Uruguay, the\n            executive authorities need to be able to present the policy\n            options to the various stakeholders, the public, the trade\n            unions and the Parliament, in a convincing manner. To\n            address this need, the loan also supports the creation of a\n            Technical Unit that will conduct legal and technical studies\n            in key areas of concern in the financial sector which will\n            be the basis of policy reform proposals submitted for\n            discussion among the different interested parties, including\n            members of
