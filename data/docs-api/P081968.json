The Government of Nepal\u2019s Poverty\n            Alleviation Fund (PAF) has integrated community driven\n            development methodologies with feedback mechanisms supported\n            by local radio as well as telephone and web platforms to\n            empower communities to design, implement, and manage their\n            own development projects that serve the poorest of the poor.\n            PAF identifies the poorest of the poor in communities\n            throughout Nepal and then partners with local government and\n            Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to provide community\n            mobilization and facilitation services, establish community\n            organizations, and elect a committee representative. Regular\n            community organization meetings ensure good communication\n            regarding finances and setting project priorities. This\n            ensures that the project closes the feedback loop and that\n            the voices of communities are heard. In addition to\n            financial assistance, the World Bank provides technical\n            assistance, drawing upon its extensive experience in\n            community driven development projects around the world and\n            in other conflict-affected countries in South Asia such as\n            Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. While PAF has instituted several\n            mechanisms to encourage interaction between community\n            members, the future will focus on connecting communities to\n            share learning and experiences so that they become fully\n            aware and able to engage with the opportunities available to them."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal -

Some lessons learned included:\n            investing sufficient effort in developing a consensus on the\n            appropriate institutional set-up for a major new government\n            initiative, before agreeing to support a project and\n            launching into detailed preparation, is extremely important.\n            In this case, close dialogue on the institutional framework\n            and mandate of PAF, before the start of preparation, helped\n            to ensure strong client buy-in which has extended through\n            the life of the original project and its scaling up. Staff\n            continuity, both of counterpart and Bank teams, and the\n            engaging of Partner Organizations (Pos) with intimate local\n            knowledge and good track records have contributed to\n            successful project implementation during a period of rapid\n            scale up of the PAF program, even during periods of\n            political transition and associated delays in some senior\n            appointments at Board level. Going forward, it would be\n            useful to review governance arrangements for such\n            appointments as one of the options for further institutional\n            strengthening under PAF II. Measurement and impact\n            assessment of quantitative indicators, using a large\n            statistical sample and rigorous methodology, requires\n            significant time and resources and a process of technical\n            support and capacity building.

the Poverty\n            Alleviation Fund (PAF) - for reaching poor and excluded\n            communities. It aims to improve access to income-generation\n            projects and community infrastructure for the groups that\n            have tended to be excluded by reasons of gender, ethnicity\n            and caste, as well as for the poorest groups in rural\n            communities. There are five main project components.\n            Project Component 1 supports Income generation projects\n            targeted to the poorest and excluded groups. Examples would\n            include micro-irrigation, micro-enterprises, crafts, land\n            productivity, animal husbandry, and others. Project\n            Component 2 supports Small Scale Village and Community\n            Infrastructure: Examples would include engineered trails,\n            footbridges, schools, clinics and other \"public\n            goods\" which are small scale and can be managed by\n            community groups or Village Development Committee (VDCs).\n            Project Component 3 supports innovations and special\n            programs. This component would provide a small amount of\n            finds in a demand-driven window to finance proposals of\n            special merit related to PAF objectives. Project Component\n            4, a capacity building component, comprises five\n            sub-components: Mobilization of Community Group, with\n            particular attention to the needs of marginalized groups;\n            Capacity Building for local bodies focusing mostly on\n            capacity building to help VDCs; Capacity Building of Target\n            Groups focusing on organizing special training and related\n            activities to enhance the skills of target beneficiaries on\n            their chosen areas of activity; Support to Micro-finance\n            Intermediaries; And a Monitoring and Evaluation System for\n            self-learning. Project Component 5 finances project\n            administration, financing project staff, establishment and\n            operating expenses including financial, procurement and\n
