Some lessons learned included: this is\n            certainly not a new lesson, but the design of this project\n            should have followed it. Packaging an urban and a rural\n            development component, microcredit, enhancement of public\n            administration and special treatment for selected groups\n            into one rather small loan and putting that all into the\n            hands of an inexperienced, weak agency should be avoided.\n            Long delays between appraisal and project start-up may\n            require revisiting and revising the project before or after\n            signing/effectiveness. Three years passed between appraisal\n            and startup of the project. Many things changed during that\n            period, such as the disappearing of municipal forums, the\n            diminishing importance and weakening structure of the\n            executing agency, ADAP, the severe deterioration of AFAP\n            (Amapa State Development Financing Agency), and the\n            understanding of the nature and importance of the project.\n            The long delay in getting to loan signing should have been\n            understood as a signal of such changes happening. Avoiding\n            stand-alone projects. Subprojects should be linked to and\n            supported by local government and other programs of\n            government and/or the private sector, thus creating\n            synergies. Several well designed subprojects had their\n            sustainability and impact negatively affected owing to the\n            lack of such interaction. The discussion and selection of\n            subproject ideas by communities and identification of a\n            community takes time. Pressure to implement rapidly tends to\n            leave little time between a call for proposals (CFP) and the\n            deadline for submission. The first CFP under the project\n            gave only 30 days for submission. This often tends to favor\n            ideas and pet projects offered by well-meaning outsiders,\n            without the necessary internal discussion, studies of\n            markets, viability of technologies, etc., and without true\n            ownership in the community. Organizations created\n            specifically for participation in CFPs are not likely to\n            come up with viable, sustainable proposals. The project\n            should require that community agreement on a proposal be\n            documented in the Minutes of a general assembly of their\n            association. This was strengthened in the third CFP which\n            required a minimum time of prior legal existence of an association."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Amapa Sustainable Communities

learn from Amazon-specific approaches, to\n            reduce urban and rural poverty, through measures that are\n            environmentally sustainable, economically efficient, and\n            socially equitable. Overall project impact will be gauged by\n            the extent to which useful lessons, both positive and\n            negative, have been generated, and succeeded in improving\n            the livelihood of urban and rural poor in Amapa. The project\n            components include: 1) Urban community development\n            sub-projects focusing on the poorest neighborhoods in the\n            cities of Macapa, Santana, and Laranjal do Jari through the\n            preparation, and implementation of community development\n            plans. Sub-projects will address problems related to: low\n            levels of community organization, lack of skills and\n            educational opportunities, the absence of community\n            planning, occupation of environmentally sensitive lands,\n            poor sanitary conditions, and inadequate access to\n            infrastructure and services. 2) Institutional strengthening\n            for poverty reduction, will build the capacity of the state\n            to address key issues of poverty, and development by\n            supporting a specific reform of the state micro-credit\n            provider, and a general reform of the state administrative\n            apparatus in project-related areas. This will include\n            support to the preparation of business plans, capacity\n            building, and rural finance. 3) Rural community development\n            sub-projects would build capacity in the rural areas, and\n            provide grants for sub-projects that will be identified,\n            developed, and managed by community, and producer\n            associations. Two types of sub-projects will be financed:\n            environmental and social infrastructure, and, support for\n            environmentally-sustainable productive investments. 4)\n            Capacity building for participatory management and technical\n            assistance (TA) will reinforce the operational capacity of\n            the Development Agency of Amapa State - ADAP - to coordinate\n            project implementation; develop a project management\n            information system; maintain a monitoring and evaluation\n            system for the project, including close collaboration with\n            the state Environment Secretariat (SEMA), and the national\n            environmental protection agency (IBAMA); and, undertake\n            information and promotional campaigns for public awareness."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil -
