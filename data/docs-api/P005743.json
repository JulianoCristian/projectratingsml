Positive lessons suggest that the definition of\n            realistic objectives, closely tied to the Government's\n            priorities in relation to education reforms, was essential\n            for the project success, and, the success of individual\n            components is, by and large, due to the sustained commitment\n            of the relevant government officials. Moreover, the sound\n            analytical preparation, and policy consultations facilitated\n            implementation, and achievement of development objectives,\n            while the flexibility in the training approach enabled a\n            responsive training redefinition, tailored to specific\n            needs, as suggested by the successful in-service training\n            for teachers, which showed positive effects on the quality\n            of education. Negative lessons however, indicate that\n            institutional weaknesses were apparent in the drafting of\n            the education assessment system, which prevented the\n            application by the Ministry of Education (MoE), to include\n            this key component for quality improvement (thus postponed\n            to the following operation). Furthermore, the lack of\n            experience with procurement guidelines, was conducive to\n            delays, and, the absence of integrated software, to\n            facilitate a proactive project management prevented higher\n            project ratings. Unfortunately, no provisions were made in\n            project accounting practices, to quantify, and include\n            in-kind contributions from MoE, as part of the total\n            expenditures by the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia -

rehabilitation of upper-basic and secondary\n            schools in provinces and areas where these are mostly needed\n            and the establishment of preventive school maintenance\n

and secondary education reform program aimed at\n            achieving improved quality and efficiency; and 2) improving\n            access to accommodate the projected increase in upper-basic\n            and secondary school enrollments. The project will be\n            executed over 5 years by the Ministry of Education and\n            Sciences (MES). The first component will help MES to improve\n            educational delivery mechanisms by financing the\n            implementation of the following quality and efficiency\n            measures: 1) strengthening the education performance\n            evaluation and assessment system by financing institutional\n            support for central and provincial evaluation services; 2)\n            promoting more effective teaching and training practices for\n            about 26,000 teachers, pedagogic and orientation counselors\n            and inspectors at school, provincial and central levels; 3)\n            strengthening the central and provincial MES administration\n            and planning services to improve the existing information\n            and feedback mechanisms between the different\n            decision-making levels. The second component will provide\n            support for improved access by financing: 1) the\n            construction of about 30 upper-basic and 44 secondary\n            schools; 2) rehabilitation of upper-basic and secondary\n            schools in provinces and areas where these are mostly needed\n            and the establishment of preventive school maintenance\n            system; and 3) provision of instructional equipment,\n            training and technical assistance."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Tunisia - Secondary Education Support Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Tunisia - Secondary Education\n            Support Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1994/08/732890/tunisia-secondary-education-support-project","projn":"TN-Secondary Education Support Project -- P005743","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Curriculum & Instruction,Gender and Education,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Gender","count":"Tunisia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961006223520"},"subsc":"Tertiary education,Central government administration,Primary education,Secondary education,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Gender","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"academic performance,ACADEMIC\n            YEAR,addition,adult illiteracy,age group,basic\n            education,boarding,boarding facilities,curricula,delivery\n            mechanisms,dropout rates,economic development,education\n            expansion,education policy,education reform,education\n            sector,Educational Facilities,educational needs,educational\n            performance,educational quality,educational\n            services,effective\n            teaching,Employment,Engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            rates,enrollment ratio,family planning,female\n            enrollment,full participation,general secondary\n            education,higher education\n            expansion,illiteracy,instructional\n            materials,instructors,labor force,life\n            expectancy,mobility,mortality,national\n            education,parents,population growth,Poverty\n            reduction,Primary school,private education,private\n            sector,Regional\n            education,repetition,retraining,safety,school\n            dropouts,school enrollments,Secondary Education,secondary\n            schools,significant impact,skills training,social\n            development,teacher,teacher training,teachers,teachers\n            associations,teaching,universities,vocational\n            education,Vocational Training,waste,young people"},"1":{"cdata!":"academic performance,ACADEMIC\n            YEAR,addition,adult illiteracy,age group,basic\n            education,boarding,boarding facilities,curricula,delivery\n            mechanisms,dropout rates,economic development,education\n            expansion,education policy,education reform,education\n            sector,Educational Facilities,educational needs,educational\n            performance,educational quality,educational\n            services,effective\n            teaching,Employment,Engineering,enrollment,enrollment\n            rates,enrollment ratio,family planning,female\n            enrollment,full participation,general secondary\n            education,higher education\n            expansion,illiteracy,instructional\n            materials,instructors,labor force,life\n            expectancy,mobility,mortality,national\n            education,parents,population growth,Poverty\n            reduction,Primary school,private education,private\n            sector,Regional\n            education,repetition,retraining,safety,school\n            dropouts,school enrollments,Secondary Education,secondary\n            schools,significant impact,skills training,social\n            development,teacher,teacher training,teachers,teachers\n            associations,teaching,universities,vocational\n            education,Vocational Training,waste,young people"}},"owner":"Human Development Group (MNSHD)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF020765-CANADIAN 'GENERAL'\n            CONSULTANT TRUST FUND,TF020250-FRENCH CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF020090-BELGIAN CONSULTANTS TRUST FUND,TF039608-TUNISIA:  QUALITY ENHANCEMENT PROJECT,TF034123-TUNISIA - SECONDARY EDUCATION\n            SUPPORT PROJECT,TF032738-TUNISIA - SECONDARY EDUCATION\n            SUPPORT, TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT,TF031409-TUNISIA ; ALGERIA - EDUCATION","repnb":"P6353"},"facets":{}}}
