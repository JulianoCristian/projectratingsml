Some of the lessons\n            learned included: fast disbursing operation financing only\n            recurrent expenditures without any conditionality, reform\n            requirements, or an explicit capacity building component is\n            an efficient and effective vehicle for responding to\n            emergency and crisis situations. The success of the ESSP III\n            is primarily due to the fact that it was aligned with the\n            Palestinian Authority (PA's) strategy to help prevent a\n            collapse in social service delivery. Even in weak capacity\n            environments, it is possible to have good Monitoring and\n            Evaluation (M&E) systems. Introducing reforms such as\n            the contracting for tertiary services under an emergency\n            type operation, there is a need to assess capacity issues as\n            well as the feasibility of the contracting mechanism used.\n            Close supervision and flexibility to respond to urgent needs\n            and changing requirements through additional financings are\n            important to ensure that the program remains responsive to\n            the emergency situation. The Bank can mitigate risks for its\n            programs by having the external auditor carry out spot\n            checks of expenses and all supporting documents every\n            quarter. And the ESSP approach of providing targeted\n            emergency budget support is more effective in ensuring that\n            essential services continue to receive their share of scarce\n            resources when compared to the alternative approach of\n            providing general budget support."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Third Emergency\n            Services Support Project

The six\n            operations are: Electric Utility Management Project, Third\n            Emergency Services Support Project, Second Gaza Emergency\n            Water Project, Second Emergency Municipal Services\n            Rehabilitation Project, Third Palestinian Non-Governmental\n            Organization (NGO) Project, and Tertiary Education Project.\n            The Electric Utility Management Project will carry out the\n            urgent restoration of the damaged network, specifically, for\n            procurement of essential distribution equipment for Gaza\n            Electric Distribution Company (GEDCO) to replace damages and\n            restore the Gaza distribution network to ensure it operates\n            in a technically stable manner. The Third Emergency Services\n            Support Project will mainly fund operating costs for\n            Ministries of Education, higher education, health, and\n            social affairs but also recurrent expenditures to ensure the\n            public facilities can remain operational. The Second Gaza\n            Emergency Water Project will finance the rehabilitation of\n            the damaged water works and equipment as a result of the\n            recent escalation of conflict in Gaza. The Second Emergency\n            Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project will finance\n            emergency municipal services assistance grants,\n            labor-intensive employment generation activities, and\n            project management costs. The Third Palestinian\n            Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) Project will support NGO\n            grants for service delivery, given its ability to address\n            the direct needs of the population towards recovery. The\n            Tertiary Education Project will help to increase the finance\n            of the ongoing Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) aimed to\n            provide support to improve the quality of Palestinian\n            tertiary education institutions and programs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"West Bank and Gaza - Replenishment of the\n            Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank and the Gaza Emergency\n            Response Additional Finance Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"West Bank and Gaza -\n            Replenishment of the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank and\n            the Gaza Emergency Response Additional Finance Program"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/05/10599139/west-bank-gaza-replenishment-trust-fund-gaza-west-bank-gaza-emergency-response-additional-finance-program","projn":"GZ-Electric Utility Management Add.
