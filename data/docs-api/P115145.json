Some lessons\n            learned included: the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n            stand-by arrangement was suspended in mid-2011, mainly\n            because the Dominican Republic did not bring electricity\n            prices in close alignment with cost recovery as envisaged. A\n            new government elected in 2012 has not been completely clear\n            about its intentions with respect to increasing electricity\n            tariffs, but the consensus seems to be that tariffs will not\n            be increased. The education and health ministries with Bank\n            support continue to make progress in the implementation of\n            programs for results. There is a need to decide on a\n            transition period for families that were classified poor\n            under the 2004 survey and are no longer categorized as poor\n            under the 2012 survey. The imperative to respond at a time\n            of crisis can be in conflict with starting a dialogue on\n            requirements for longer term reform. The extensive policy\n            dialogue and meaningful analytic work that go along with a\n            normal development policy operation were not part of this\n            operation's preparation. An overly complex design\n            typical of a normal development policy loan without short\n            term indicators that can be monitored (for reforms that will\n            take far longer than the duration of the operation) can\n            detract from efficacy. In light of the previous two lessons,\n            a development policy loan may be the wrong instrument to\n            support a country in a financial crisis. The lack of updated\n            political economy analysis can hamper reforms and Bank value\n            added. A critical mass of Bank interventions in a country\n            can act as a shock absorber for shortcomings in individual\n            operation and help deliver results at times of crisis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Public Finance and\n            Social Sector Development Policy Loan Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Dominican Republic - Public\n

Republic - Public Finance and\n            Social Sector Development Policy Loan Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Public Finance and\n            Social Sector Development Policy Loan (DPL) Project for\n            Dominican Republic were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was substantial,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the global economic crisis exacted a heavy\n            toll on the Dominican economy, endangering macroeconomic\n            balances and in particular the Government's fiscal\n            position. The DPL proved to be a timely, flexible and\n            effective instrument that helped the Government meets the\n            challenges of the global crisis within a sustainable fiscal\n            strategy that protected social sectors. Past crises led to\n            sharp increases in poverty; to avoid this risk, Bank support\n            helped the Government prioritize spending, provide basic\n            services, and meet its payment obligations, and at the same\n            time restoring confidence and macroeconomic sustainability.\n            Moreover, by offering policy support for the\n            Government's reform agenda during a period of\n            vulnerability, the Bank was able to help articulate and\n            contribute positively to pro-poor, pro-development and\n            institutional strengthening policies that may have otherwise\n            suffered backtracking during a prolonged economic crisis.\n            DPL support also provided a window of opportunity for\n            achieving a fundamental reform of the subsidies regime. The\n            politically popular electricity subsidies under PRA\n            (Programa de Reduccion de Apagones - Program to Reduce\n            Blackouts) and the universal subsidy on liquefied gas were\n            costly transfers that the Government struggled to address in\n            the past. The crisis environment and DPL policy support\n            facilitated their replacement with targeted subsidies\n            BONOLUZ (cash transfer subsidy of electricity consumption)\n            and BONOGAS (cash transfer subsidy of liquefied gas),\n            generating important fiscal savings and reducing incentives\n            of excess consumption. As seen in other Bank lending,\n            policies that have the biggest impact are those closely\n            aligned with the Government's priorities. As political\n            pressures emerge, Governments are less likely to implement\n            reforms if their own commitment is weak. One way to address\n            potential backtracking is to structure Bank support in\n            response to results achieved on the ground, in contrast to\n            the current reliance on prior actions which may be only\n            nominally indicative of Government commitment such as legal\n            decrees or short-lived measures. The Bank's long\n            history of involvement in the Dominican energy sector raises\n            questions regarding the prospects for successful electricity\n            reform given the political climate in the Dominican Republic."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Dominican Republic - Public Finance and\n            Social Sector Development Policy Loan
