In addition to long-term\n            institutional support, including necessary materials, the\n            project would fund short-term specialists and training\n            programs. The project would also help fund special studies\n            related to project preparation. The project would help the\n            ministries involved to determine investment priorities and\n            develop projects, thereby substantially strengthening their\n            investment programs and reducing reliance on outside\n            assistance. Risks of poor project performance would arise\n            primarily from the lack of sufficiently trained counterpart\n            staff in project preparation and related delays in\n            adequately staffing the project preparation units. The\n            project's provision for extensive on-the-job training,\n            as well as domestic and overseas training programs would\n            address these problems. Risks of delay would be reduced with\n            the requirement that, as a condition of effectiveness, a\n            project preparation unit (PPU) would be established in the\n            Ministry of Land Reclamation; the PPU in the Ministry of\n            Irrigation has already been established."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Egypt - Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Egypt - Technical Assistance Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1981/05/723454/egypt-technical-assistance-project","projn":"EG-Technical Asst.
