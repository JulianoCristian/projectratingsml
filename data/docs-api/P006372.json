The\n            Bank's preparation and appraisal of this project was\n            satisfactory. The project was justified and a strong effort\n            was made to reflect the best of past experience in project\n            design. Borrower commitment to this project was steadily\n            eroded by fiscal and economic problems and political\n            factors, over which individual federal and state project\n            agencies had little control. The project exceeded federal\n            and state fiscal and institutional capacity during a\n            difficult transitional period in Brazil. This could not have\n            been foreseen at appraisal, although the Bank appreciated\n            the fact that relative state/regional implementation\n            capacity was not uniform. The lessons from this project are\n            the following: (a) When a project strategy and/or design is\n            overtaken by political, legal or economic events, the Bank\n            should promptly undertake the needed changes; (b)\n            Macroeconomic, fiscal and political conditions are critical\n            arbiters of project outcome, influencing Borrower\n            commitment, counterpart funding availability, project\n            incentives and the behavior of institutions; (c) Projects of\n            national scope should ensure that: supervision quality can\n            be maintained; required actions are flexibly tailored to\n            regional/state capacity and conditions; and,\n            poorly-performing states/regions receive concentrated\n            attention and possibly special incentives to improve\n            performance; (d) Effective M&E integrated into the daily\n            work of extensionists and extension institutions, and fed\n            into impact and cost-effectiveness analyses, remains a\n            challenge for the National System for Technical Assistance\n            and Rural Extension (SIBRATER); (e) Institutional\n            strengthening should be supported by and coalesce around a\n            strategic vision of national (and state-level) extension\n            services; and (f) The project validated the Bank's\n            policy of not financing salaries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Second Agricultural Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Brazil - Second
