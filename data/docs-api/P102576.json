The first lesson is that\n            sometimes it pays to take a bold approach. Bank management\n            understood that accelerating the processing of the policy\n            operation was crucial for ensuring the success of its\n            decision to reengage in CAR, despite a most challenging\n            environment. In so doing, it took the conscious decision to\n            present the policy operation to the Board before the interim\n            strategy note. In such countries, the risks are often high,\n            but it was deemed that the risk of not doing the operation\n            was greater than the risk of doing it. Poor governance is\n            often at the root of internal conflicts. Improving\n            governance through a series of concrete actions showing that\n            the Government is making a clear break with past practices\n            is a key component of a reengagement program. When\n            reengagement is initiated, a field presence is critical to\n            ensure close coordination among donors and help the\n            Government take confidence-boosting measures on time.\n            Ensuring close supervision is also a key. Sustaining\n            external financing support in post conflict countries is\n            crucial for the success of a reengagement program: (i) often\n            reengagement program is vast and government's capacity\n            needs to be significantly enhanced to sustain the\n            implementation of the reform program; and (ii) dedicating\n            part of the proceeds of the operation to debt services is\n            also crucial, especially for countries engaged in High\n            indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) with renewed outlays for debt\n            service obligations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Central African Republic - Reengagement and\n            Institution-Building Support Program"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Central African Republic -\n
