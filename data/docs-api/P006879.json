Some lessons\n            learned included: the Bank should minimize rigidities in\n            loan conditionality by emphasizing subtance over specific\n            modalities and being open to loan restructuring if needed.\n            Policy objectives pursued by the loan were defined in\n            substantive terms with few prescriptions on means of\n            implementation, and flexibility was built into the timing of\n            reforms through floating conditions and identification of\n            entities for performance plans by defining selection\n            criteria. Providing a mechanism in the project design for\n            countries to take advantage of regional expertise is a\n            useful tool for implementation. A key analytical basis for\n            the design of the reforms was expertise derived from similar\n            reform experiences that were taking place or had been\n            carried out in other Latin American countries. The key\n            ingredient for the success of an adjustment program as\n            ambitious as the Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP) is a\n            high degree of ownership and priority assigned to it by the\n            authorities and their willingness to invest their political\n            capital and technical capability in pursuing the\n            program's
