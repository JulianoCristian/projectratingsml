Lessons learned include the following: 1)\n            Future education projects should focus on fewer core project\n            objectives and be better adapted to the institutional short-\n            and medium-term implementation capacities. Strong\n            coordination and division of roles should be established\n            with the donor community during preparation activities. 2)\n            Capacity building support for information management,\n            planning, and monitoring and evaluation should be\n            strengthened.  3) Ensure that the criteria for future\n            selection of the ECCE centers will allow the poorest\n            communities to be more easily selected and to benefit from\n            full public support.  4) Site selection, governed by\n            physical characteristics of the proposed location for a\n            school, is crucial and sites should be chosen to maximize\n            the use of the school. The selected sites should be free\n            from any encumbrances and time should be allowed for\n            compulsory acquisition. Land surveys must be carried out on\n            selected sites to verify boundaries and ensure there are no\n            encroachments by neighbors. 5) Project design should\n            consider the close  integration of the Project Coordination\n            Unit (PCU) into the Ministry's internal structure to\n            help foster effective communication and coordination and\n            minimize the possible 'politicization' of the\n            Project Coordination Unit. 6)  Provide assistance to schools\n            in implementation and monitoring of resources.  7) In order\n            to avoid procurement delays, a clear and definitive\n            understanding should be reached between the GORTT and the\n            Bank on the role of the Central Tender Board.  8) The\n            project operated with reimbursements only, without a Special\n            Account. The project accounts performed in a satisfactory\n            manner and the system operated in coordination with the\n            Ministry of Finance. Releases of funds made by the Ministry\n            of Finance and checks to suppliers were issued within two to\n            three working days. Future projects should consider using\n            the same account system. 9) Greater attention should be paid\n            to the particular decentralized status of the education\n            system of the Island of Tobago, in order to prevent legal\n            and political difficulties that may arise during project implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Trinidad and Tobago - Basic Education
