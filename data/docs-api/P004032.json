At the\n            sector level, the project yielded two important lessons of\n            broad applicability. First, it showed that sector reforms\n            can be initiated successfully when there is strong\n            government commitment, even in post-conflict countries with\n            difficult political, economic, and institutional\n            environments. Under these conditions, the Bank can provide a\n            key facilitating role through its financing of critical\n            physical investments, technical assistance, and advice\n            focused on improving electricity sector efficiency, and\n            establishing an independent and transparent legal and\n            regulatory framework. Second, for small countries with\n            limited institutional capacity, electricity sector reforms\n            should first focus on commercialization, and selecting a\n            market structure tailored to the country's\n            circumstances. Private sector participation can be\n            introduced once the governance structure and commercial\n            operations are in place. At the project level, the lessons\n            that emerge from implementation experience address the use\n            of expert advisers, which should be designed to ensure they\n            transfer their management and technical skills to local\n            staff, and, staff continuity is an important factor in\n            fostering greater cooperation. In terms of future strategy,\n            the two main challenges facing Cambodia's power sector\n            are to broaden access for the poor - in a manner that is\n            fully integrated with overall power sector reforms - as the\n            country moves toward private power provision and the\n            commercialization of the power sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cambodia - Phnom Penh Power\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/02/5639992/cambodia-phnom-penh-power-rehabilitation-project","projn":"KH-Phnom Pehn Power Reh -- P004032","docty":"Project Performance Assessment Report","subtopic":"Energy Technology & Transmission,Banks & Banking Reform,Poverty Assessment,Montreal Protocol,National Governance","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Cambodia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000012009_20050304091101"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Power,Law and justice","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Energy and mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Accounting, ADB, auditing, audits, Bank\n            management, Bank Performance, bases, Bidding, cities,\n            climate, consulting services, corruption, cost of capital,\n            councils, economics, EdC, education, Electricity,\n            entrepreneurs, Equalization, financial covenants, Financial\n            Data, financial management, Financial Performance, Financial\n            Performance Indicators, Fiscal Year, foreign exchange,\n            health, Human Development, inflation, Infrastructure\n            Services, institutional capacity, Institutional Development,\n            International Accounting Standards, laws, local capacity,\n            local government, Management Assistance, management\n            services, mandates, natural resources, negotiations,\n            operating costs, operating efficiency, operating expenses,\n            Pacific Region, partnership, peer review, Performance\n            Indicators, performance standards, power plants, private\n            sector, privatization, procurement, producers, Project\n            Implementation, Project Management, project preparation,\n            Public Enterprises, Public Expenditure, radio, reform\n            implementation, reform process, reforms, regulatory\n            framework, REHABILITATION, renewable energy, return on\n            assets, Rural Infrastructure, safety, savings, service\n            providers, service quality, service standards, supervision,\n            Technical Assistance, transparency,"}},"owner":"Energy & Mining Sector Unit (EASEG)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022733-PHRD-POWER SECTOR\n            REHABILITATION PROJ.,TF032055-CAMBODIA - ENERGY,TF032938-CAMBODIA - PHNOM PENH POWER REHAB,TF032939-CAMBODIA - PHNOM PENH POWER REHAB,TF036056-CAMBODIA - PHNOM PENH POWER\n            REHABILITATION PROJECT","repnb":"31663"},"1121236":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/03/1121236/cambodia-phnom-penh-power-rehabilitation-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2001/03/1121236/cambodia-phnom-penh-power-rehabilitation-project","new_url":"2001/03/1121236/cambodia-phnom-penh-power-rehabilitation-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/06/08/000094946_0105240408435/Rendered/INDEX/multi0page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2001/06/08/000094946_0105240408435/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf","credit_no":"2782","docdt":"2001-03-26T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2001-06-08T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Cambodia - Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project outcome is rated satisfactory\n            overall, while sustainability is likely. World Bank\n            performance is adjudged to be highly satisfactory while\n            Borrower performance is satisfactory. The list of lessons\n            learned include the following: Termination of Consulting\n            services for project management should be available to the\n            PMU until all civil works have been fully completed, tested,\n            and commissioned to ensure that Bank funding and assistance\n            is available in the case of failures during any of these\n            events. The Cambodian electricity company (EDC) was left\n            alone to bring up claims of incomplete works and equipment\n            breakdown to the Contractor. Resolution of these issues has\n            burdened EDC staff time and resources. Current Bank\n            procurement practices regarding conflict of interest could\n            interfere with efficient project implementation in that\n            mandatory selection of different consulting firms for\n            preparation and supervision reduces ownership of bidding\n            documents and continuity in project management.\n            Collaboration between the Borrower and the Implementing\n            Agency is more effective when there is open communication\n            and clear understanding of the different roles of each,\n            particularly at the senior management level. When selecting\n            turn-key contracts types, attention should be given to the\n            implementation capacity and technology needs of the\n            implementing agency.
