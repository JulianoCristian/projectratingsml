Some lessons learned\n            included: at the time of appraisal it was considered too\n            ambitious to adopt a comprehensive basin-wide approach for\n            the project. Today, the greater awareness of water pollution\n            in China increases the likelihood that a multi-province\n            basin-wide approach could be adopted. It is recommended that\n            future similar projects explore the possibility of a\n            comprehensive approach, consisting of a Bank-led\n            multi-agency effort encompassing agriculture and other major\n            factors that have an impact on water quality. Project\n            implementation was affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory\n            Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and serious floods. This\n            notwithstanding, a project implementation period of four\n            years provided little flexibility for start up problems and\n            unforeseen events. The project implementation period needs\n            to be set realistically, and consistent with the\n            urban/environment project profile for the region, which is\n            about six to seven years, on average. Such delays may occur\n            regardless of whether or not complaints are valid. The level\n            at which such complaints need to be resolved (State Council)\n            is too high for the project teams to effectively address.\n            This is a relatively common problem for Bank-financed\n            projects in China. It is recommended that the Bank consider\n            adopting some mechanism to resolve complaints in\n            International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in a\n            consolidated way."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -

In addition,\n            construction of wastewater treatment plants will also be\n            financed in Guoyang, and Luan municipalities. The capacity\n            of the Anhui Environmental Monitoring Center will be\n            strengthened, by upgrading its equipment, and municipal\n            laboratories, providing vehicles for field sampling; and\n            improving technical, and managerial skills. Technical\n            assistance (TA) will be provided for institutional\n            development, for construction management, and will support\n            as well staff training; and, 2) support wastewater systems\n            investments in the Shandong Province to three\n            municipalities, and in Juxian, Rizhao. It includes\n            construction of secondary sewers, and house connections;\n            interceptors; pumping stations, pumping/transmission mains;\n            and wastewater treatment plants.

Mitigation include: 1)\n            contract provisions, through precautionary clauses to\n            minimize dust, and air quality, and ensure safety; 2)\n            limited operating schedules, and adequate equipment to abate\n            noise disturbances; 3) ordinance enforcement to improve\n            treatment systems, and solid waste collection on waterways;\n            and, 4) monitor wastewater discharges through sewerage\n            inspections, and testing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Anhui component"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Huai River Water\n
