All three projects have an\n            overall rating of satisfactory. The initial objectives of\n            the NRDP through its component state projects, as outlined\n            in the Memorandum of the President (MOP), were to: (i)\n            increase regional agricultural production and productivity;\n            (ii) generate income and employment opportunities for\n            low-income farm families; (iii) increase the states capacity\n            to provide efficient agricultural services to small farmers;\n            and (iv) promote water resource development and technology\n            generation and diffusion to reduce small farmers\n            vulnerability to recurring drought. The Minas Gerais MOP\n            project included an additional objective: to increase\n            community participation in all phases of the development\n            process. Lessons learned from these projects are as follows:\n            (a) most rural development projects will falter under severe\n            macro-economic and fiscal pressures and a policy environment\n            unfavorable to agriculture; (b) When a program strategy and\n            project design is overtaken by events which make it\n            redundant, the Bank should promptly undertake the needed\n            changes, including complete reformulation if necessary, and\n            which will enable it to succeed in the new circumstances;\n            (c) the willingness to experiment benefits projects\n            Bank-wide. The reformulated projects emerged from a\n            successful pilot experience (APCR), enriched by drawing on\n            wider experiences, and their successors the Rural Poverty\n            Alleviation Program (RPAP) have continued to pilot\n            increasingly progressive variants of the core model; (d)\n            grant-based investment is a legitimate and effective tool\n            for jumpstarting capital accumulation by the rural poor, and\n            the matching grant approach contributed to sustainable local\n            development in the three states; and (e) supervision is\n            indispensable for subproject and overall project success and\n            should be strengthened, and involve local entities closest\n            to the communities, particularly Municipal Councils and\n            Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Northeast Rural Development Program\n            - Pernambuco, Piaui, and Minas

       Brazil hopes to (a) increase agricultural production and\n            productivity; (b) generate income and employment\n            opportunities for low-income rural families; (c) promote\n            water resource development and technology generation and\n            diffusion to decrease small farmers' vulnerability to\n            recurring droughts; (d) increase community

small farmers. To that\n            end, the project involves several components including\n            construction of two state-managed irrigation schemes\n            totalling 2,840 ha and benefitting 750 farm families;\n            studies for possible future irrigation projects;\n            construction or rehabilitation of about 170 simple rural\n            water supply systems; and adaptive agricultural research and\n            basic seed production. In addition, the project provides for\n            extension services to about 38,000 small farmers; investment\n            credit for about 12,000 farms including 3,250 irrigated\n            farms;
