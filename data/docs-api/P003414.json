Institute (NRII). The project will finance civil works,\n            furniture, equipment, specialist services, fellowships, and\n            other related inputs to: (a) raise the quality of graduates\n            and research work in the agricultural sciences; (b) expand\n            both undergraduate and postgraduate enrollment and research\n            capacity in these fields; and (c) strengthen the\n            organization and management of resources in agricultural\n            education and research. Project risks grow out of the\n            Bank's limited knowledge of China's agricultural\n            research system, the dimensions of China's manpower\n            pool in agriculture, and the presently changing system of\n            agricultural education. The studies of China's\n            agricultural manpower and agricultural research system to be\n            conducted under the project will contribute to reducing\n            these risks and will enable the Government to improve the\n            effectiveness of future projects in agriculture."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Agricultural Education and Research Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Agricultural Education\n            and Research Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/10/725763/china-agricultural-education-research-project","projn":"CN-Ag.
