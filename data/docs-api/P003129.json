The benefits of this project would\n            include: increased farmer income and productivity, increased\n            agricultural production and domestic food supplies, and\n            improved efficiency of field extension services. The project\n            is expected to cover half a million farm families, or 15 %\n            of the total farming population of Zaire. It will also have\n            a critical impact on the environment, and on farm women."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Zaire - Pilot Extension Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Zaire - Pilot Extension Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1990/01/738319/zaire-pilot-extension-project","projn":"ZR-Pilot Extension-115242 -- P003129","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Congo, Democratic Republic of","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928123845"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways,(Historic)Agricultural extension","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,agricultural\n            marketing,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,agroforestry,animal health,animal\n            nutrition,annual report,audits,Beans,beef,biodiversity,cash\n            crops,Cassava,climatic conditions,coffee,commercial\n            bank,commodity,Cost\n            Analysis,cotton,crop,cropping,crops,cultivation,debt,development\n            projects,ecological conditions,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,energy sources,Environmental\n            Impact,environmental protection,equipment,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,experiment stations,Extension,extension\n            services,families,FAO,farm,farmer,farmers,farming,Farms,fish,food\n            crops,food imports,food security,food\n            supplies,forestry,forests,fruit\n            trees,grasses,grazing,Groundnuts,harvesting,income,incomes,inflation,inflation\n            rates,integrated rural\n            development,integration,Isolation,livestock,livestock\n            development,local\n            authorities,Maize,malnutrition,marketing,meal,meat,Ministries\n            of Agriculture,mixed cropping,natural resources,Natural\n            Resources Conservation,NGOs,oil palm,Palm\n            Oil,pesticide,pesticides,planting,potential\n            yields,poultry,produce,pulses,recycling,research\n            agenda,Rice,rural development,rural infrastructure,rural\n            population,rural roads,Seed,seed production,Seeds,small\n            farmers,soil fertility,soils,sowing,spacing,Structural\n            Adjustment,sugar,trees,tubers,UNDP,United\n            Nations,wheat,women in agriculture,working conditions"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural extension,agricultural\n            marketing,agricultural production,agricultural\n            productivity,agricultural\n            research,Agriculture,agroforestry,animal health,animal\n            nutrition,annual report,audits,Beans,beef,biodiversity,cash\n            crops,Cassava,climatic conditions,coffee,commercial\n            bank,commodity,Cost\n            Analysis,cotton,crop,cropping,crops,cultivation,debt,development\n            projects,ecological conditions,Economic\n            Analysis,employment,energy sources,Environmental\n            Impact,environmental protection,equipment,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,experiment stations,Extension,extension\n            services,families,FAO,farm,farmer,farmers,farming,Farms,fish,food\n            crops,food imports,food security,food\n            supplies,forestry,forests,fruit\n            trees,grasses,grazing,Groundnuts,harvesting,income,incomes,inflation,inflation\n            rates,integrated rural\n            development,integration,Isolation,livestock,livestock\n            development,local\n            authorities,Maize,malnutrition,marketing,meal,meat,Ministries\n            of Agriculture,mixed cropping,natural resources,Natural\n            Resources Conservation,NGOs,oil palm,Palm\n            Oil,pesticide,pesticides,planting,potential\n            yields,poultry,produce,pulses,recycling,research\n            agenda,Rice,rural development,rural infrastructure,rural\n            population,rural roads,Seed,seed production,Seeds,small\n            farmers,soil fertility,soils,sowing,spacing,Structural\n            Adjustment,sugar,trees,tubers,UNDP,United\n            Nations,wheat,women in agriculture,working conditions"}},"owner":"WBOff:Kinshasa-CC2:DRC/CG(Braz) (AFCC2)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"8166"},"facets":{}}}
