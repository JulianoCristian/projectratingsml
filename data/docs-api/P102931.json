The Project\n            Development Objective remained unchanged during the life of\n            the project. With respect to the key indicators, they were\n            found to be difficult to measure and, in some cases,\n            impossible to establish a strong causality between project\n            and outcome. In May 2009 the PIU and the Bank agreed on a\n            revised set of indicators which were included in the Aide\n            Memoire dated November 20, 2009. Lessons learned during the\n            project were that an intensive early period of communication\n            and participation as part of the process of problem\n            recognition and problem definition is fundamental for\n            ensuring support to institutional changes. The endorsement\n            and strong ownership of the leaders of an institution are\n            crucial to ensure the continuity and success of major\n            reforms. The cost curve of institutional reform should take\n            into account the lead- time necessary for consensus building\n            and task preparation. Finally, the Bank should evaluate more\n            closely the procurement thresholds or consider more flexible\n            procurement rules for countries with a proven record of\n            controlling corruption."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Chile - Institutional Strengthening of the\n            Ministry of Public Works Technical Assistant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Chile -
