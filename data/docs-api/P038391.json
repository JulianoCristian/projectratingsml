Overall, the world\n            Bank's performance is rated as satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance overall has to be rated satisfactory as, despite\n            the volatile political situation, frequent Government\n            reshuffles and subsequent changes in personnel, most\n            components were executed. Lessons learned included the\n            following: Working with several co-financiers introduces\n            more complexity in implementation that can hamper the\n            implementation of the project beyond the Bank's\n            control--the lesson learned is that agreements between the\n            government and individual co-financiers should be signed by\n            the time the project becomes effective. The Ministry of\n            Education had a weak implementation capacity--staff lacked\n            qualifications in project management, procurement, financial\n            management, and monitoring and evaluation, which resulted in\n            delays as well as unnecessary energy and time spent in\n            communication and reviewing. Extra care should be paid to\n            recruitment and appointment of staff working in the project,\n            based only on performance. Co-financiers should pay\n            particular attention to technical assistance assignments and\n            include the Bank and the client in the selection process.\n            Even in the case in which radical changes are foreseen,\n            capacity building should start within existing\n            structures--if not, existing structures will oppose changes,\n            while the
