In line with the Country Assistance\n            Strategy, the program would contribute to the objective of a\n            more sustainable Brazil to reduce poverty and achieve a\n            higher quality of life for all Brazilians in both rural and\n            urban areas. A sustainable Brazil will also be a source of\n            competitiveness and provide wealth for the future. The loan\n            forms a significant part of the Bank's overall\n            assistance strategy to an innovative, committed, and\n            high-performing client. The loan will support environmental\n            sustainability through policy reforms focusing on two major\n            areas: (1) increasing the effectiveness and the efficiency\n            of the environmental management system; and (2)\n            mainstreaming environmental sustainability in selected\n            sector policies and programs. This loan would be the first\n            operation in a series of up to three loans over a four-year\n            period. The operation does not involve additional spending\n            and focuses on policy and institutional changes that should\n            lead to more effective and efficient environmental\n            management. A companion Technical Assistance Loan is planned\n            to follow this operation. The program is expected to result\n            in the improvement of environmental conditions in the medium\n            and long term. The set of policy and institutional reforms\n            supported by the proposed loan include: (a) increasing the\n            transparency and social control of the environmental\n            management system (EMS); (b) improving the effectiveness of\n            the EMS through better coordination and clearer definition\n            of responsibilities among the three levels of government;\n            (c) increasing the use of economic instruments as compared\n            to command- and-control mechanisms; (d) promoting\n            sustainable development in the Amazon and the protection of\n            other key ecosystems; and (e) improving water resources\n            management through increased decentralization, improved\n            local management and
