Overall World Bank\n            performance was satisfactory. Overall Borrower performance\n            of the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo\n            (UNMIK) is judged satisfactory. Nevertheless, there are some\n            issues regarding implementation of policy commitments under\n            this projct. In particular, there is still some uncertainty\n            about the implementation of agreements on abolishing the\n            tariff and on staffing reductions in the health sector. This\n            has represented some reconsiderations of priorities in\n            response to evolving circumstances, some lack of cordination\n            across pillars in the UNMIK administration and some\n            equivocation on policy goals and ovjectives. These isues\n            regarding project implmentation have required the Bank to\n            maintain a close and constant dialgue with INMIK and to\n            monitor performance quite closely. Some other lessons\n            gleaned from this experience are: The Bank can play an\n            important role in providing budget support in post-conflict\n            situations. Ownership by the authorities and selectivity in\n            conditionality have been important in the success of the\n            operations. The technical details of the operation need to\n            be negotiated carefully when the authority is segmented.\n            Frequent, close, and intensive consultation with donors, ad\n            the dovetailing of the Bank's work and that of the\n            principal donors was critical. Informal bilateral contacts\n            were important tools."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -\n            Second Economic Assistance Grant Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of\n            Yugoslavia - Second Economic Assistance Grant Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2001/06/1551927/kosovo-federal-republic-yugoslavia-second-economic-assistance-grant-project","projn":"XK-Economic Assistance 2 Project -- P071114","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Urban Economics,Banks & Banking Reform,Public & Municipal Finance,Public Sector Economics,National Governance","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Kosovo","entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_01072704020660"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Multisector","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,anti-corruption,auditing,Authority,authorization,Bank\n            Performance,bank supervision,banking supervision,banking\n            system,banking systems,banknotes,budget constraints,budget\n            formulation,budget management,budgetary systems,capital\n            budgets,commercial banks,Council of Ministers,Economic\n            Assistance,economic growth,economic\n            reform,electricity,execution,financial control,financial\n            institutions,Financial rate of return,financial\n            regulation,financial resources,financial\n            sector,FISCAL,fiscal decentralization,fiscal\n            management,fiscal policy,fiscal stance,fiscal\n            sustainability,FISCAL YEAR,foreign trade,good\n            governance,government institutions,Governmental\n            Organization,human capital,institution\n            building,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Development,insurance,inventory,legislation,licenses,local\n            tax,macroeconomic conditions,macroeconomic\n            stability,NATIONS,private sector,public\n            administration,public agencies,public expenditure,public\n            expenditure management,public finance,public\n            institutions,Public Sector,public sector employment,Public\n            Sector Management,public services,public utilities,reform\n            programs,social assistance,Social Policy,Social\n            Reforms,social risks,tax administration,tax collection,tax\n            policy,tax regime,tax revenues,tax system,Technical\n            Assistance,trade flows,transition economies,transparency,treasury,utilities,wages"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,anti-corruption,auditing,Authority,authorization,Bank\n            Performance,bank supervision,banking supervision,banking\n            system,banking systems,banknotes,budget constraints,budget\n            formulation,budget management,budgetary systems,capital\n            budgets,commercial banks,Council of Ministers,Economic\n            Assistance,economic growth,economic\n            reform,electricity,execution,financial control,financial\n            institutions,Financial rate of return,financial\n            regulation,financial resources,financial\n            sector,FISCAL,fiscal decentralization,fiscal\n            management,fiscal policy,fiscal stance,fiscal\n            sustainability,FISCAL YEAR,foreign trade,good\n            governance,government institutions,Governmental\n            Organization,human capital,institution\n            building,institutional capacity,Institutional\n            Development,insurance,inventory,legislation,licenses,local\n            tax,macroeconomic conditions,macroeconomic\n            stability,NATIONS,private sector,public\n            administration,public agencies,public expenditure,public\n            expenditure management,public finance,public\n            institutions,Public Sector,public sector employment,Public\n            Sector Management,public services,public utilities,reform\n            programs,social assistance,Social Policy,Social\n            Reforms,social risks,tax administration,tax collection,tax\n            policy,tax regime,tax revenues,tax system,Technical\n            Assistance,trade flows,transition economies,transparency,treasury,utilities,wages"}},"owner":"Poverty Reduction/Econ Mngmt (ECSPE)","trustfund":"TF024903-SECOND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE\n            GRANT FOR KOSOVO","repnb":"22283"},"facets":{}}}
