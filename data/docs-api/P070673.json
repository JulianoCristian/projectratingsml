Some lessons learned included: to\n            keep the momentum in the telecom reform and to close the gap\n            between the mountainous areas and the lowlands, targets for\n            rural access to telecom should be established with the\n            operators. The universal access fund should be established\n            with clear set operators' charges and targets. The slow\n            uptake of electricity connections in the pilot areas showed\n            that demand studies, i.e. willingness to pay studies as\n            preparation for the pilots often do not reflect reality.\n            More detailed planning techniques, including financial\n            planning and calculation of subsidies will have to be\n            developed. The late start of the rural pilots also prevented\n            the project to perform impact evaluations that should still\n            be performed. The next phase should include relevant skills\n            for income generation and productive use of electricity. It\n            will also be important that the Government clarified the\n            future of the Rural Electrification Unit, the National Rural\n            Electrification Fund (NREF), so that donor and private\n            sector funds could be harnessed and leveraged."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Utilities Sector Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho - Utilities

Private capital\n            inflows will foster improvements, and access to reliable\n            electricity services, and, technical assistance (TA) will be\n            provided by an Interim Management Task force, to manage the\n            Lesotho Electricity Corporation (LEC); a sales advisory\n            group will develop a divestiture strategy for LEC, providing\n            expertise in banking, international law, and technical\n            issues. LEC streamlining involve retrenchment payments,\n            which includes training for retrenched employees, and for\n            retained employees regarding implementation of\n            restructuring/downsizing programs; 2) support regulatory\n            reforms, to enforce appropriate regulations in the utilities\n            sectors, ensure fair treatment of sector operators, and\n            encourage transfer of technologies, and private investments;\n            3) finance a study to recommend options regarding the\n            hydroelectric power, and export potential; and, assess the\n            feasibility of electricity access to areas not commercially\n            viable; 4) establish an Investment Fund/Unit Trust, and,\n            provide TA to support regional integration, through income\n            generating activities in the sectors; 5) provide advisory\n            services, and capacity building; and, 6) provide financial,\n

concern,\n            regards the rural, and urban hookups, and related\n            activities, therefore this environmental assessment reviews\n            the potential adverse effects, mainly, on highland\n            ecosystems, threatening its flora, and fauna, which include\n            endemic species of plants, a rich variety of medicinal\n            plants, and herbs, and aquatic life, covering significant\n            habitats. Environmental adversity already include soil\n            erosion, and land degradation, loss of organic content, and\n            nutrients due to poor agricultural practices, and various\n            forms of bio-mass removal, thus water-holding capacity is\n            reduced. Degraded rangelands have given way to\n            deforestation, causing water run-off, reduced infiltration,\n            and low groundwater levels. Mitigating measures include: 1)\n            appropriate engineering design should avoid slope sites to\n            prevent soil erosion, while construction activity will be\n            conducted only during the dry season, and, re-vegetation\n            will be practiced as needed; 2) electric pole placement, and\n            power lines will avoid natural habitats to prevent\n            bio-diversity losses, ensuring that micro-topography\n            restores site conditions caused by flooding, and drainage\n            disruption; 3) safe, and proper storage of equipment, and\n            construction materials, should prevent soil, and water\n            contamination resulting from lubricant, or chemical leakage,\n            to protect public health, aquatic ecosystems, and habitats;\n            and, 4) socioeconomic impacts will be minimized by ensuring\n            that alignments will not require resettlement; that\n            agricultural lands will be avoided,
