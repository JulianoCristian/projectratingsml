Some lessons\n            learned included: bottom-up development based on a\n            community-driven development (CDD) approach can be achieved\n            in a context like Niger if supervision is careful and\n            benefits from a dedicated team. The process is particularly\n            difficult if public services and institutions outside the\n            main cities are limited or non-existent (as was the case in\n            Niger). For a new program in such a challenging field as\n            community-driven development, it is necessary to have modest\n            expectations at the beginning. In Niger, the Community\n            Action Program had an outreach target of 20 percent of the\n            communes (districts) for the first four years. For an\n            emergency program the intended outcome is that the effects\n            of the crisis are minimized and recovery from the disaster\n            can start. For an avian flu attack the outcome would be that\n            information is quickly shared with responsible authorities\n            and that deaths are avoided or at least minimized. Thus the\n            original outcome indicators in the Project Paper were\n            correctly conceived when they largely concentrated on the\n            reaction and reporting times by the local population and\n            then by the authorities responsible for surveillance and treatment."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - Community Action Project in Support\n            of the First Phase

co-financed by the Global Environmental\n            Facility (GEF). Its development objectives aim at sustained\n            poverty reduction and improved local governance through\n            empowering communities and local governments, to improve\n            natural resources and ecosystem management, and to raise the\n            levels of health, education, and food security, thereby\n            stimulating economic growth. These goals will be achieved\n            through local-level capacity building efforts and\n            implementation of demand-driven micro-projects. The CAP\n            explicitly aimed at supporting Niger's emerging process\n            of decentralization by given communities the responsibility\n            and resources for local development and by providing local\n            governments with the means and administrative capacity to\n            support the communities to which they are accountable. The\n            global environmental objective of the project is to promote\n            community-based integrated ecosystem management as a means\n            of reducing the region's vulnerability to\n            desertification and poverty, while fostering the multiple\n            global environmental benefits such as reduction of\n            vulnerability to climate change and conservation
