Some lessons learned included: a\n            longer than anticipated implementation period is not\n            necessarily indicative of inefficient outcomes. Even though\n            project efficiency may be adversely affected by a long\n            implementation period, the delays may reflect issues not\n            envisioned at the time of project design, and if\n            implementation is well executed and focused on the more\n            productive sub-components it may still achieve a critical\n            mass of outcomes. Knowledgeable and well-experienced\n            technical advisors can play an instrumental role in the\n            success of a technical assistance project. Bank dialogue and\n            ability to remain engaged in fast evolving Middle Income\n            Countries (MICs) will benefit from the availability of a\n            broader menu of support instruments that could be deployed\n            flexibly to address real-time country needs. In appraisal of\n            a financial sector project, it may be helpful to consider\n            the linkages between the macroeconomic environment and the\n            financial sector in

The\n            first phase focused on facilitating voucher-based mass\n            privatization which ended in mid-1994. The second phase\n            focuses on building a capital market which is sustainable\n            and integrated with the wider financial system. In line with\n            this focus, the project has four specific objectives: 1)\n            build a comprehensive policy and legal framework; 2) build\n            core institutional capacity in regulation and self\n            regulation; 3) improve the efficiency, transparency and\n            systemic stability of market architecture; and 4) ensure the\n            efficient issuance, service and registration of Russian\n            Federation debt securities, the largest segment of\n            Russia's capital market. Derived from these objectives,\n            the project has three components: 1) the regulatory\n            infrastructure component which will establish the policy\n            framework, laws, and regulations and the institutional\n            capacity in regulation and self regulation which constitute\n            an essential underpinning of modern capital markets; 2) the\n            market architecture component which will support private\n            sector organizations in building efficient, fair and secure\n            trading, clearance, settlement and registration systems; 3)\n            the government securities tracking system which will enhance\n            the capability of the Ministry of Finance to manage its\n            treasuries program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Russian Federation - Capital Market\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Russian Federation - Capital\n            Market Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/05/696527/russian-federation-capital-market-development-project","projn":"RU-Capital Market Development Project -- P042622","docty":"Technical Annex","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Banks & Banking Reform,Economic Theory & Research,Financial Intermediation,International Terrorism & Counterterrorism","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Russian Federation","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"4":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961022115020"},"subsc":"Law and justice,Capital markets,Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1996","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Finance","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agriculture,American Depository\n            Receipts,auction,Audits,Banking\n            Law,banks,bonds,brokers,capital gains,capital market\n            regulation,capital markets,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,common stock,Corporate Equity,corporate\n            finance,corporate governance,coupons,credit\n            markets,Debt,disclosure,disclosure\n            requirements,dividends,economic reform,enforcement\n            powers,equity markets,EXCHANGE RATES,financial\n            institutions,financial resources,financial sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed income,foreign investors,Government\n            Bonds,Government Regulation,Government\n            securities,income,institutional\n            development,insurance,insurance industry,interest\n            rates,laws,legal framework,liquidation,liquidity,low\n            interest rates,Market Instruments,mutual\n            fund,NASDAQ,offerings,OTC,policy\n            decisions,portfolio,portfolios,privatization,public\n            participation,public\n            policy,recapitalization,redemption,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,risk aversion,risk\n            management,savings,Securities,securities markets,settlement\n            systems,shareholdings,State Property,stock exchanges,Stock\n            prices,subsidiaries,taxation,technical assistance,Trading\n            systems,transaction costs,transition\n            economies,transparency,Treasury Bills,Universal banking"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,Agriculture,American Depository\n            Receipts,auction,Audits,Banking\n            Law,banks,bonds,brokers,capital gains,capital market\n            regulation,capital markets,Central Bank,commercial\n            banks,common stock,Corporate Equity,corporate\n            finance,corporate governance,coupons,credit\n            markets,Debt,disclosure,disclosure\n            requirements,dividends,economic reform,enforcement\n            powers,equity markets,EXCHANGE RATES,financial\n            institutions,financial resources,financial sector,FISCAL\n            YEAR,fixed income,foreign investors,Government\n            Bonds,Government Regulation,Government\n            securities,income,institutional\n            development,insurance,insurance industry,interest\n            rates,laws,legal framework,liquidation,liquidity,low\n            interest rates,Market Instruments,mutual\n            fund,NASDAQ,offerings,OTC,policy\n            decisions,portfolio,portfolios,privatization,public\n            participation,public\n            policy,recapitalization,redemption,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,risk aversion,risk\n            management,savings,Securities,securities markets,settlement\n            systems,shareholdings,State Property,stock exchanges,Stock\n            prices,subsidiaries,taxation,technical assistance,Trading\n            systems,transaction costs,transition\n            economies,transparency,Treasury Bills,Universal banking"}},"owner":"Private/Financial Sectors Devt (ECSPF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"4":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"repnb":"T6916"},"facets":{}}}
