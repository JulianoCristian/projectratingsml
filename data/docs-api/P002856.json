Some of the lessons learned\n            from the project are: 1) the need to have a close\n            coordination between macro-level reforms and sectoral\n            investment projects in order to maximize the impact of\n            investments. The close link with Economic Recovery Project\n            (ERAC) was instrumental in Government's acceptance of\n            the liberalization of cotton export marketing; (b) a\n            mid-term review is an essential instrument to gauge not only\n            the effectiveness of project implementation, but also the\n            need to validate project objectives and redesign its\n            approaches and activities to take into account changing\n            circumstances. In the case of this project, no mid-term\n            review was carried out. However, the project's\n            objectives, as interpreted by Bank staff and Government\n            officials, slowly evolved from an emphasis on production and\n            efficiencies to institutional reform. The lack of a mid-term\n            review and project redesign had no impact on the final\n            outcome, but it could have been an appropriate forum to\n            highlight slow progress in key areas; and (c) institutional\n            reforms requires time to build consensus and be implemented,\n            and their impact is generally slower than expected. This\n            needs to be factored into project design and the expected\n            benefit stream."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Togo - Cotton Sector Development
