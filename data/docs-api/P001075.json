The\n            lease/affermage arrangements did not entail major investment\n            risks for the private partners, but the investment climate\n            in the country and the general trend of international\n            operators to limit their international exposure influenced\n            the strategy of Guinean Water Operation Company\n            (SEEG's) shareholders. Whereas the prior project\n            mobilized many donors, this project was purely a Bank\n            operation. Other (bilateral and multinational) donors were\n            expected to step in later and specifically after the closure\n            of the new contractual arrangements in urban water supply.\n            The unsatisfactory Bank performance reflects the ambiguous\n            message conveyed to the Government during project\n            implementation. The Bank's supplemental financing did\n            not help to strengthen the reform process and actually gave\n            the wrong signal to the Government."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Third Water Supply ad Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea -

Specific project objectives are (1) to\n            improve Guinea's urban and rural water resource\n            management; (2) to build institutional capacity by\n            strengthening the National Service of Hydraulics (SONEG),\n            and developing its activities in urban water distribution,\n            increasing coverage in Conakry and metered connectins; and\n            (3) to rehabilitate and extend Conakry's sewerage and\n            to contribute to improvements in environmental quality,\n            through constructing, rehabilitating, and extending the\n            existing network; and by training private local contractors.\n            The operation's three components are: (1)\n            rehabilitating and expanding Conakry's water supply\n            network, constructing two storage reservoirs, installing\n            household connections, strengthening SONEG's regulatory\n            and policy capacity, and assisting it with preparing an\n            urban water strategy and negotiating a new management\n            contract; (2) arranging a cost recovery study among other\n            detailed studies and recruiting a private operator to run\n            the sewage service, promoting proper techniques, training,\n            and support to rehabilitate and construct on-site systems,\n            rehabilitating and maintaining the existing Conakry sewerage\n            system, constructing a sewage treatment facility, and\n            rehabilitating a waste stabilization pond for sludge and\n            sewage treatment; (3)
