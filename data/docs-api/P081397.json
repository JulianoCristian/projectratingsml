Some lessons\n            learned included: the analytical work conducted as part of\n            the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA) and in preparation\n            for the first operation provided a thorough examination of\n            environmental priorities and an understanding of the\n            country's institutional framework for environmental\n            management. The actual process of carrying out the analysis\n            was equally as important, as it helped to build consensus\n            among stakeholders on reforms to the National Environmental\n            System (SINA). Inter-institutional coordination is essential\n            for strengthening the reform program. Inter-institutional\n            coordination, in particular National Planning Department\n            (DNP) participation in the DPL Program has been instrumental\n            in enhancing coordination among key SINA actors as well as\n            other line ministries. This coordination among line\n            ministries, as well as vertically between national and\n            regional authorities, has enriched policy development in the\n            areas of air

Specifically, the\n            program will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the\n            National Environmental System (SINA), and, integrate\n            principles of sustainable development into key sectors, with\n            a particular emphasis on protecting the most vulnerable\n            groups. The Program will improve environmental management,\n            particularly in urban areas, and, will support the\n            development of a results-based framework for planning and\n            monitoring progress of the SINA, as well as improvements in\n            inter-institutional coordination, and increased public\n            participation in environmental decision-making. In addition,\n            preparation of critical policies, and laws related to air\n            quality, water quality, solid waste management, and\n            environmental licensing will also be supported. Improvements\n            in air and water quality in urban centers will lead to\n            decreased morbidity, and mortality rates, and other health\n            effects. Increased accountability, transparency and improved\n            public participation will provide the most vulnerable groups\n            a voice in environmental decision-making. Several risks have\n            been identified, most important, the overall political\n            context, namely the internal conflict and violence\n            associated with illegal drug activity, which could\n            negatively affect the fiscal and macroeconomic environment,\n            while aggravating the social situation. Throughout the\n            reform program, several actions are being undertaken to\n            mitigate risks, that is, through complementary actions in\n            other sectors to support the development of a stronger\n            foundation for peace, and reforms, allowing resources to be\n            used for the transition to a post-conflict Colombia."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia -
