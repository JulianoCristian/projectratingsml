The lessons learned indicate that jumbo\n            operations such as the Special Structural Adjustment Loan\n            (SAL) that was approved for Argentina in 1998 can, because\n            of their lumpy repayment profile, cause serious problems\n            both for the Bank and for the borrower down the line. The\n            government needs first to agree with the Bank on a program\n            of Bank support together with its underlying requirements.\n            That understanding should then be incorporated into the\n            overall financing plan of the government including\n            agreements with the IMF. The government was fully aware that\n            quasi-monies were a serious impediment to the effective\n            management of monetary policy. The initiative to reestablish\n            a unified money by withdrawing quasi-monies was home-grown.\n            Likewise, the government fully recognized that, if the\n            withdrawal of
