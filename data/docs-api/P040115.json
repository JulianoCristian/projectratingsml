Therefore, selling rather than leasing the\n            equipment to the concessionaire, leads to a cleaner\n            concession arrangement, and thus precludes the need for a\n            patrimony corporation. The Bank's experience with\n            railway concessions contributes to designing, and financing\n            of such operations, in particular, in attracting private\n            investors to difficult infrastructure sectors. However, it\n            is also suggested that renegotiation of infrastructure\n            concessions should be avoided, or deferred as possible,\n            since it undermines credibility of the concession system\n            itself. And, the delicate issue of staff redundancy, should\n            be managed with adequate compensation, providing pensions\n            under exceptional early retirements, and outsourcing-company\n            work to displaced staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Railway Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Cote d'Ivoire - Railway\n            Rehabilitation

likely. Overall, World Bank performance is rated\n            highly satisfactory. Given the large effort during the fast\n            track preparation, the deep involvement of the implementing\n            agency, and especially the privatization committee, overall\n            Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. Lessons learned\n            included the following: Continuity in staffing of\n            supervision missions by the Bank is important. The original\n            task manager maintained her participation in the project\n            from 1995 until 1998, the railway specialist and the\n            operations officer from 1995 to 2001. This greatly\n            contributed to the project's success. The project\n            involved a large donor coordination effort, much of which\n            was successful. A landlord company is not an adequate\n            arrangement in railway concessions. Other mechanisms to\n            monitor the concession can be implemented which are less\n            costly and at lest as efficient. The rolling concession\n            arrangement--an innovative feature of this\n            concession--provides the incentive framework for private\n            participation in railway operations. Timely donor\n            contribution to finance large and costly infrastructure is\n            essential to support the launching of a concession such as\n            for railway services, which is profitable for the entire\n            economy but which does not have a very high financial viability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Cote d'Ivoire - Railway Rehabilitation
