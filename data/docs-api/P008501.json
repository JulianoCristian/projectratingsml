The project had a substantial impact on\n            institutional development. World Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, while Borrower performance was unsatisfactory.\n            Experience with this project suggests the following lessons:\n            1) Financing the continuing work of contract advisors who\n            are already advising the government is a questionable\n            practice, since it makes it extremely difficult for the Bank\n            to fulfill its quality control function. Bank funding should\n            primarily support activities when the Bank can contribute to\n            the success of these activities, if in no other way than by\n            reviewing the reports and recommendations of the consultant.\n            2) The contracts that were negotiated with legal advice from\n            advisors financed by the Bank remain confidential documents.\n            The Bank should make every effort to get governments to\n            agree to make public the basic financial elements of\n            agreements and contracts that are negotiated with foreign\n            companies. Public review of such contracts is the best way\n            to establish transparency and accountability in dealing with\n            the exploitation of national resources such as oil. In\n            particular, the Bank should only provide technical\n            assistance for the negotiating of contracts that are\n            intended to become part of the public domain (at least in\n            their broad terms)."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Petroleum Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan - Petroleum Technical\n

The lessons address,\n            first, the reasons why the project performed successfully:\n            The degree of staff continuity was critical, not only\n            experience wise, but in that it retained as well, the\n            project's institutional memory. Furthermore, it\n            strengthened the borrower's ownership of project\n            activities, which emphasized the responsibility needed to\n            manage the implementation, and operation of the project.\n            These activities, if conducted under clear sponsorship,\n            minimize the risks of unnecessary, or unsustainable work,\n            easing implementation. Secondly, those areas where\n            improvement could be made: Regardless of how minimal it may\n            appear, administrative efficiency is critical in keeping\n            financial obligations against the state budget in track, and\n            avoiding inefficiencies, which could be later magnified as\n            overall delay factors in the implementation process. In\n            addition, implementation was hindered by poor coordination,\n            which affected its pace, and project deliverables. A\n            proactive, and responsive Bank support is not only needed\n            from Headquarters, but from the field office as well, which\n            require the full capacity of local staff. However, the\n            apparent lack of knowledge, and inexperience of local staff\n            about the Bank, precluded covering the full scope of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan - Petroleum Technical Assistance Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kazakhstan -

The\n            project consists of two components: Institutional\n            Development, and Project Preparation and Implementation\n            Support. The first, has three subcomponents:  1) supporting\n            the creation of an effective framework for promoting foreign\n            investments in the petroleum subsector by assisting in\n            finalizing a petroleum law and formulating a tax code,\n            appraising potential investment projects, and structuring\n            and negotiating transactions with prospective investors, and\n            training local staff;   2) assisting the implementation of a\n            program corporatizing and restructuring the petroleum\n            industry, and preparing the basis for increased private\n            sector participation; and  3) assisting in identifying and\n            addressing priority management training needs, and preparing\n            and administering training in market-oriented petroleum\n            industry operational and commercial practices. The second\n            component also has three subcomponents:  1) planned studies\n            reviewing the economic feasibility of constructing new\n            product pipelines and a crude oil pipeline connecting\n            oilfields in the west with the two refineries in the east;\n            2) assisting the assessment of regional and domestic market\n            potential for natural gas, and the supply and investment\n            options for participating in meeting the demand; and  3)\n            providing advisory and consultant services to manage the\n            day-to-day project's implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kazakhstan -
