The project\n            achieved some of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development was significant, sustainability is unlikely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, the benefit of the project could have been\n            enhanced by more careful project preparation, particularly\n            in coordination with other donors, better project\n            definition, and stronger conditionality. Second, it would\n            have been more beneficial and effective if the consultants\n            had prepared their final reports in the field, in\n            consultation with their Guinean counterparts, instead of\n            preparing them in their home country. Third, from the\n            beginning, Guinean working level staff should have been\n            consulted in contract negotiation to avoid interminable\n            discussions with the consultant after contract signature.\n            Fourth, the consulting firm selected for project\n            coordination must manage to maintain expert staffing for as\n            long as possible to facilitate continuation of the work,\n            especially in the field of training higher level Guinean\n            staff. Finally, Guinean staff should be more fully\n            integrated in the preparation of project reports."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Mineral Sector Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Guinea - Mineral Sector\n            Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/02/734704/guinea-mineral-sector-management-project","projn":"GN-Mineral Sector Mgmt -- P001039","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,ICT Policy and Strategies,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"West Africa!$!80474"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960925234310"},"subsc":"(Historic)Mining and other extractive","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Mining","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Audit reports,auditing,auditors,Bank\n            Loans,Bank Performance,bi,conditionality,consulting\n            services,contractual arrangements,Economic Impact,economic\n            rate of return,Environmental Impact,environmental\n            issues,exchange rate,expenditures,exploitation,Financial\n            Performance,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,GDP,geological\n            data,Identity,instruction,investment banking,Mines,Natural\n            Resources,potential investors,poverty\n            alleviation,producers,productivity,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,Structural Adjustment,technical\n            assistance,technology transfer,training programs,Training seminars,valuation"},"1":{"cdata!":"Audit reports,auditing,auditors,Bank\n            Loans,Bank Performance,bi,conditionality,consulting\n            services,contractual arrangements,Economic Impact,economic\n            rate of return,Environmental Impact,environmental\n            issues,exchange rate,expenditures,exploitation,Financial\n            Performance,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,GDP,geological\n            data,Identity,instruction,investment banking,Mines,Natural\n            Resources,potential investors,poverty\n            alleviation,producers,productivity,regulatory\n            framework,reorganization,Structural Adjustment,technical\n            assistance,technology transfer,training programs,Training seminars,valuation"}},"owner":"AFC","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"West Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"West Africa"}},"repnb":"11621"},"739972":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/11/739972/guinea-mineral-sector-management-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1985/11/739972/guinea-mineral-sector-management-project","new_url":"1985/11/739972/guinea-mineral-sector-management-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-24T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/11/01/000009265_3970625095249/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/1985/11/01/000009265_3970625095249/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","credit_no":"1637","docdt":"1985-11-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"1985-11-01T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Guinea - Mineral Sector Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project would finance technical\n            assistance to help the Government of Guinea (GOG) manage its\n            mining shareholdings, undertake geological work and\n            exploration promotion, improve the mining sector's\n            regulatory framework, and strengthen institutional\n            efficiency through administrative reform.
