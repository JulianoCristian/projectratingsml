OED rates the outcome of both the FIS II\n            water supply and sanitation components and the RWSP projects\n            as \"satisfactory\" since the FIS II project\n            combined \"substantial\" relevance, efficiacy, and\n            efficiency and the RWSP project \"high\" relevance\n            with \"substantial\" efficacy and efficiency.\n            Sustainability of both projects are rated\n            \"likely.\" World Bank performance of both projects\n            is rated \"satisfactory\" although it should be\n            noted that quality at entry of the RWSP was superior to that\n            of the FIS II. Similarly, Borrower performance for both was\n            rated as \"satisfactory.\" Two main lessons were\n            derived and recommendation made: The end of construction\n            does not end the government's responsibilities;\n            therefore, the government must create back-up regulation and\n            operational assistance to the communities. Second, rural\n            water supply and sanitation programs invariably neglect the\n            sanitation components; therefore, it is advised that a\n            national sewerage and sanitation program be prepared and implemented."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -

The\n            lessons learned include: a) A lack of impact on school\n            achievement can be resolved by working more closely with the\n            Ministry of Education to design integrated interventions\n            that include infrastructure and teaching processes. b) High\n            administrative costs can be reduced by maintaining greater\n            stability in the amount of resources allocated to the Fund.\n            It is useful to explore mechanisms to provide greater\n            flexibility in staffing so that the SIF can adjust to\n            variation in demand. c) It is important to review the\n            subproject cycle and eliminate unnecessary steps in order to\n            avoid delays attributable to process within the Fondo Social\n            de Emergencia project cycle that are excessively expensive.\n            d) Delays due to the lack of counterpart resources from the\n            municipalities can be avoided by allocating more resources\n            to the municipalities. e) Sector ministries should be\n            involved in working with the SIF to maintain consistency of\n            sectoral policies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -
