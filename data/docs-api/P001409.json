Ratings for the Community Development Support\n            Project were as follows: outcome was unsatisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was significant; Bank performance was\n            highly unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was also\n            highly unsatisfactory. Some of the lessons learned include:\n            a successful construction program does not necessarily mean\n            a successful development program. Attention is needed to the\n            full objectives of a project, including \"software\"\n            as well as \"hardware.\" LHWP- 1B's successful\n            water infrastructure program will be a main pillar in\n            Lesotho's development program for decades to come. But\n            the royalties did not go to poverty reduction, the\n            project's most fundamental objective. Also, while\n            LHWP-1B was strong in all aspects related directly to\n            construction (engineering, physical works and water\n            delivery), it performed weakly in software aspects (capacity\n            building, training and resettlement). Lesotho and South\n            Africa's \"good practice\" water treaty has\n            features that may be relevant elsewhere. The following\n            features have contributed to success: (i) clarity and detail\n            in the treaty document, including procedures for adjusting\n            to changing circumstances; (ii) appropriate institutions - a\n            bridging institution has worked well in coordinating actions\n            between the two countries; (iii) focused objectives; and\n            (iv) independent dispute resolution mechanisms within the\n            institutions themselves. The Bank's 20-year engagement\n            providing technical and policy support, and as a motivator\n            for the financial involvement of other lenders, also\n            contributed to the treaty's success. Safeguards\n            implementation should not be given second-tier priority, but\n            should receive the same attention as the main project\n            components.

It is\n            one of the world's poorest countries, with a population\n            of about 2.1 million. The economy is substantially dependent\n            on South Africa as a source of income, employment and\n            foreign exchange. Most of Lesotho's land area is\n            mountainous and ill-suited for agriculture, but there is an\n            abundance of water. In the early 1980s, less than 6 percent\n            of its water was consumed domestically, with the remainder\n            running through South Africa to the sea. South Africa, on\n            the other hand, was chronically short of bulk water -\n            particularly in the country's industrial heartland of\n            Gauteng, some 400 km north of Lesotho. The Treaty committed\n            the two countries to implement phases 1A and 1B of the\n            Lesotho's Highlands Water Project (LHWP), transferring\n            water in the amount of 18 m/sec and 12 m/sec, respectively,\n            and left the subsequent phases open for further\n            negotiations. Phases IA and IB have made use of the\n            comparative advantages of Lesotho and South Africa to the\n            mutual benefit of both countries - with Gauteng receiving\n            much needed water, and Lesotho receiving revenues from water\n            export and hydropower. Future phases of the LHDP envisioning\n            additional water transfers to South Africa may be delayed. A\n            main reason is that South Africa in the mid-1990s, with\n            World Bank help, started to focus less on engineering\n            solutions to supply water to meet growing needs and more on\n            measures for managing water demand. In the longer-term, the\n            LHWP may still continue to be a key underpinning for\n            Gauteng's and Lesotho's future development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Creating benefits from cooperation in shared\n            water resources : Lesotho's highlands water project\n            phases IA and IB"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Creating benefits from\n            cooperation in shared water resources : Lesotho's\n            highlands water project phases IA and IB"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/12/13025769/creating-benefits-cooperation-shared-water-resources-lesothos-highlands-water-project-phases-ia-ib","projn":"LS-Hiland Water 1b Project -- P001409,LS-Highland Wtr.I -- P001396","subtopic":"Water Use,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Lesotho","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20101108022532"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Roads and highways,Power,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Water feature stories ; issue no. 12","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Energy and mining,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abundance of water, bulk water, capacity\n            building, construction, cost savings, environmental impacts,\n            environmental issues, export, hydropower, inter-basin\n            transfers, large water storage, programs, public works,\n            regional water management, River Basin, Rivers, sale of\n            water, sea, transparency, water demand, Water Projects,\n            Water Resources, water sales, Water Sector, water shortages,\n            water storage, water transfers"}},"owner":"Urban Dev. & Services Prac 1 (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF023410-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF023550-GLO.

The Requesters claim they have\n            and will suffer harm because Bank Management has violated\n            policies and procedures in the preparation of Phase 1A of\n            the project for which financing was approved in 1991, and\n            the then proposed Phase 1B of the Lesotho Highlands Water\n            Project, (together referred to as LHWP). The Requesters ask\n            for an investigation into their claims in order to resolve\n            the current and potential problems of water consumers in\n            poor communities of Gauteng. They believe their access to\n            water, or continued access to water, has been adversely\n            affected by the debt incurred to construct Phase 1A, and may\n            be further adversely affected by premature debt incurred for\n            Phase 1B. It should be noted that those suffering or fearing\n            harm are not against Phase 1B- just its timing. The\n            Requesters' concerns about the conditions on the ground\n            are valid but there does not appear to be a connection\n            between these conditions and any observance or not by the\n            Bank of its own policies and procedures. Rather, they appear\n            to be a part of the enormous legacy and odious burden of\n            apartheid. In this context, the Panel recommends that the\n            Executive Directors do not authorize an investigation into\n            this Request for Inspection."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Lesotho Highlands Water Project :\n            Report and Recommendation on Request for Inspection"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho -
