The appropriate project design\n            contributed to a highly dynamic process, with a close and\n            effective supervision. The Government responded in a\n            cooperative manner, with reform goals being mostly met,\n            despite a certain reluctancy towards some bank\n            privatizations. Sustainability is likely, considering that\n            the measures implemented have strong government backing, as\n            well as popular support. However, some key lessons may still\n            be drawn from success, such as: 1) The effective program\n            sustainability is the result of the SAL team, who\n            appropriately highlighted the benefits of the reform\n            program, now passed into law, regulation, and routine\n            practice. Such effectiveness requires a skilled team with\n            adequate resources. 2) The necessary and effective technical\n            assistance, as well as donor coordination, contributed to\n            the project's success, because of advanced planning\n            prior to implementation. 3) Critical to the SAL success is\n            the fact that it was conducted in parallel with sector\n            operations, as part of an integrated country strategy, thus\n            providing momentum, technical advice and critical resources.\n            4) Challenging reforms may become stimulus for action,\n            promoting bold actions across sectors."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lithuania -
