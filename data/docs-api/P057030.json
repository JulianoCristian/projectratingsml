The main lessons highlight\n            the following. Despite some progress in Bolivia's\n            regulatory system for infrastructure services, as well as\n            for its banking system, its credibility is somehow hindered\n            by political interference, namely, concerning interventions\n            required by problem operations. Therefore, it is suggested\n            the Bank should be more sensitive to the political\n            environment and the possible changes early on, particularly\n            for those operations with significant legislative\n            components, where legislation passing is pending, to reduce\n            potential implementation delays. Furthermore, long-standing\n            practices in Bolivia - such as the Government's\n            assurance guaranteeing one hundred percent of deposits -\n            presented difficulties, and risks in passing legislation,\n            not conducive to investor confidence, and much less to\n            stabilization of the banking system. However, proactive\n            supervision measures (e.g., public disclosure) would ensure\n            remedial actions, that would safeguard both depositors, and\n            investors. This also implies a project design that considers\n            the interplay of reforms in the financial sector, which\n            could ultimately affect their viability. Nonetheless, the\n            contraction of the electric power capacity in 1999, signaled\n            opportunities in the market for investors, assured\n            reliability, and capacity to meet demand. But provision of\n            technical assistance should have better prepared those\n            entities - operationally, structurally, and capacity wise -\n            in meeting demands for quality, and coverage."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Regulatory Reform Sector\n            Adjustment Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Regulatory Reform\n
