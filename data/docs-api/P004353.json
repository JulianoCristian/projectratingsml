(iii) Poultry: typical\n            project poultry units would consist of 100 layers or the\n            production of 600 broilers per year at the rate of 50 per\n            month. Financing would be provided for sheds, water tanks,\n            cages, equipment and chicks. As some previous poultry\n            investments have been unsuccessful only twenty farmers would\n            be financed initially, and further investments would depend\n            on the satisfactory evaluation of the initial group. (iv)\n            Technical services: the project would finance the\n            construction of a new Livestock Farmers Training Center and\n            an In-Service Training Center for DASF staff."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Papua New Guinea - Smallholder Livestock\n            Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Papua New Guinea - Smallholder\n            Livestock Credit Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1972/10/1558166/papua-new-guinea-smallholder-livestock-credit-project","projn":"PG-Livestock-319955 -- P004353","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Agricultural Research,Economic Theory & Research,Banks & Banking Reform,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Papua New Guinea","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Oceania!$!80466"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101902191981"},"subsc":"(Historic)Livestock","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abattoirs,agricultural\n            production,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH\n            CENTERS,agriculture,animal,animal protein,animals,Asian\n            Development Bank,balance of payments,Bank\n            loans,beans,beef,beef cattle,beef industry,beef\n            production,breeding,capital goods,cattle\n            development,Coconut,commodities,consumers,crops,current\n            expenditures,DEBT,development strategy,development\n            works,economic development,economic rate of\n            return,eggs,employment,eXchange\n            value,exports,farm,farmer,farming,fattening,fattening\n            farms,feed,feeds,ff,fish,Fisheries,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,government expenditures,GROSS NATIONAL\n            PRODUCT,HIGHLANDS,imports,income,interest rate,interest\n            rates,labor costs,Labor Force,land resources,Livestock\n            Credit,livestock extension,Livestock Farmers,market\n            prices,oil,per capita\n            income,pig,pigs,pork,potatoes,poultry,poultry farms,poultry\n            meat,poultry production,poultry products,price\n            declines,production costs,PUBLIC DEBT,ranches,real\n            GNP,research centers,savings,smallholder beef,smallholder\n            cattle,Smallholder Development,Smallholder\n            Livestock,smallholders,steers,subsidiary,Tax rates,tax\n            revenue,tax revenues,telecommunications,Timber,total\n            costs,transport,UNDP,Value Added,veterinary,working capital"},"1":{"cdata!":"abattoirs,agricultural\n            production,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH\n            CENTERS,agriculture,animal,animal protein,animals,Asian\n            Development Bank,balance of payments,Bank\n            loans,beans,beef,beef cattle,beef industry,beef\n            production,breeding,capital goods,cattle\n            development,Coconut,commodities,consumers,crops,current\n            expenditures,DEBT,development strategy,development\n            works,economic development,economic rate of\n            return,eggs,employment,eXchange\n            value,exports,farm,farmer,farming,fattening,fattening\n            farms,feed,feeds,ff,fish,Fisheries,foreign\n            exchange,GDP,GNP,government expenditures,GROSS NATIONAL\n            PRODUCT,HIGHLANDS,imports,income,interest rate,interest\n            rates,labor costs,Labor Force,land resources,Livestock\n            Credit,livestock extension,Livestock Farmers,market\n            prices,oil,per capita\n            income,pig,pigs,pork,potatoes,poultry,poultry farms,poultry\n            meat,poultry production,poultry products,price\n            declines,production costs,PUBLIC DEBT,ranches,real\n            GNP,research centers,savings,smallholder beef,smallholder\n            cattle,Smallholder Development,Smallholder\n            Livestock,smallholders,steers,subsidiary,Tax rates,tax\n            revenue,tax revenues,telecommunications,Timber,total\n            costs,transport,UNDP,Value Added,veterinary,working capital"}},"owner":"World Bank Office: Sydney (EACNF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Oceania"},"1":{"geo_region":"Oceania"}},"repnb":"P1124"},"facets":{}}}
