Some lessons learned included: disbursing\n            against spending on priority programs and against\n            achievement of key indicators worked well. In particular the\n            notion that a disbursement can be pro-rated according to the\n            number of indicators achieved (and so that an entire tranche\n            is not held up when one indicator is missed) helped provide\n            flexibility and incentives for different government actors\n            to both achieve their own goals as well as to help others in\n            achieving their indicators. The program and indicators were\n            developed and reflected the Borrower's own program.\n            Without full ownership, this project will not have had\n            positive outcomes. The Government of Ceara took ownership\n            and was committed to carrying out the program. The key\n            counterparts remained the same throughout the project and\n            had the authority to request information from other entities\n            involved and to make decisions. The ability to include a\n            technical assistance (TA) component in a multi-sector sector\n            wide approach (SWAp) is a key advantage of this type of\n            instrument. However, it is critical that the TA be\n            well-designed, closely linked to the achievement of results\n            and owned by the government. Also, it is critically\n            important to assure that the capacity for implementing TA exists."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Ceara Multi-Sector Inclusion\n            Development
