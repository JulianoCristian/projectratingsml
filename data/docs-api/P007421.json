In line with the Government's social objectives,\n            the JPSC program includes making public service electricity\n            available to low income and rural customers. Domestic\n            bidders would receive a 15% margin of preference in bidding\n            on project items. The project does not pose any significant\n            risks other than what are normally associated with this type\n            of undertaking."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jamaica - Second Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jamaica - Second Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/01/727279/jamaica-second-power-project","projn":"JM-Power Ii-270650 -- P007421","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Engineering,Business in Development,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Jamaica","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Caribbean!$!80452"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_9810191154452"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounts,acquisition,audited\n            financial statements,auditors,Benefit\n            Streams,billing,bills,borrowing,budgeting,coal,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy consumption,construction,cost\n            estimates,Crude oil,debt,debt service,depreciation,economic\n            activity,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic conditions,economic\n            development,elasticities,electric\n            power,Electricity,Electricity Consumption,electricity\n            generation,electricity supply,employment,Energy\n            Resources,energy supply,engineering,engineers,exchange\n            rate,FINANCIAL ANALYSIS,financial officers,Financial\n            planning,financial reports,fire,fuel,fuel oil,geological\n            data,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Gross National\n            Product,hydroelectric\n            power,income,inflation,Insurance,internal audit,labor\n            force,natural gas,nuclear reactors,oil reserves,payroll,per\n            capita income,petroleum,power generation,power\n            industry,power systems,Procurement,public relations,Public\n            Service,Public Utilities,Rural\n            Electrification,sales,Transport,Utilities,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounts,acquisition,audited\n            financial statements,auditors,Benefit\n            Streams,billing,bills,borrowing,budgeting,coal,commercial\n            energy,commercial energy consumption,construction,cost\n            estimates,Crude oil,debt,debt service,depreciation,economic\n            activity,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS,economic conditions,economic\n            development,elasticities,electric\n            power,Electricity,Electricity Consumption,electricity\n            generation,electricity supply,employment,Energy\n            Resources,energy supply,engineering,engineers,exchange\n            rate,FINANCIAL ANALYSIS,financial officers,Financial\n            planning,financial reports,fire,fuel,fuel oil,geological\n            data,GNP,Gross Domestic Product,Gross National\n            Product,hydroelectric\n            power,income,inflation,Insurance,internal audit,labor\n            force,natural gas,nuclear reactors,oil reserves,payroll,per\n            capita income,petroleum,power generation,power\n            industry,power systems,Procurement,public relations,Public\n            Service,Public Utilities,Rural\n            Electrification,sales,Transport,Utilities,water supply"}},"owner":"Caribbean Countries CMU (LCC3C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"1":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"},"2":{"geo_region":"Caribbean"}},"repnb":"1493"},"facets":{}}}
