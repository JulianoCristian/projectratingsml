The Bank was\n            accommodating. A major flexibility that enhanced increased\n            commitment was the banks approval for the factory shell\n            program which provided the investor with the basic\n            motivation to accelerate investment decisions. During the\n            period of the project the Bank carried out regular\n            supervisory missions characterized by constructive dialogue\n            between the Bank and LNDC. LNDC's performance in\n            achieving the objectives of the second line of credit\n            represent an improvement over performance of the first\n            credit facility. During the first four years of the second\n            credit line, the Corporation's performance was\n            admittedly poor in terms of commitments, disbursements and\n            project approvals however. this trend was dramatically\n            reversed when economic fortunes turned around, and when the\n            International Development Association (IDA) consented to new\n            approvals to the utilizations of the credit line. The\n            project was therefore well conceived and in line with the\n            main problems and priorities of the industrial sector."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Second Lesotho National\n            Development Corporation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho -
