The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower are\n            rated satisfactory. The project's successes in housing\n            finance are owed to a very large extent to good financial\n            and judicial fundamentals, and extreme care taken in\n            designing the Jordan Mortgage Refinance Company (JMRC) and\n            its lending and borrowing mechanisms to avoid both\n            uncertainties in financial contracts and distortions in the\n            sector. The legal basis for loans pledged as collateral to\n            JMRC had been researched, and framework agreements with\n            participating banks made clear. As a result, there was not a\n            single instance of a conflict arising between JMRC and a\n            bank regarding mortgage-loan collateral. The only main point\n            of contention between JMRC and banks has been the pricing of\n            JMRC's loans, with banks invariably wanting loans at\n            rates too low to support JMRC's costs of funding and\n            operations. That problem resulted from a distortion in the\n            financial sector that had not been made clear during\n            preparation. This leads to a key lesson regarding the\n            housing finance component: Deepening financial markets,\n            including creating secondary markets for loans and\n            increasing institutional investment opportunities, depends\n            not only on creating frameworks for new financing\n            mechanisms, but also most importantly on the underlying\n            market for primary lending and general economic activity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan - Housing Finance and Urban Sector\n            Reform Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Jordan - Housing

of\n            Jordan are to improve the efficiency of the housing and\n            housing finance sectors, to promote private sector\n            development in land and housing production, and to reduce\n            the government's role in both sectors. Through the\n            establishment of a Secondary Mortgage Facility (SMF), the\n            project will aim to improve the efficiency with which\n            medium- and longer-term financial flows of mortgage lending\n            are mobilized, to facilitate and foster competition in\n            market-based mortgage lending, and to lengthen the term\n            structure of mortgage lending. Through the implementation of\n            institutional and regulatory reforms in the real sector, the\n            project will also aim to improve the enabling environment\n            for responsive private sector participation and competition\n            in land and housing development for lower income households.\n            The first of two project components is to create an SMF\n            incorporating: (a) an SMF refinancing program; (b) equipment\n            for the SMF; and (c) technical assistance to the SMF. The\n            second project component is to make institutional and\n            regulatory reforms; more specifically, to provide technical\n            assistance to the Housing and Urban Development Corporation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Jordan -
