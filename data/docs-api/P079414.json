Transport Sector Development Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Transport Sector\n            Development Project for Rwanda were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. The lesson learned from this\n            project is that institutional reforms conducted in parallel\n            to project implementation causes delays. It is to be learned\n            that establishment of new institutions require longer time\n            than anticipated for transition, which greatly impacts on\n            implementation progress, and needs policy consultations and\n            commitment as part of the preparatory work by both the Bank\n            and government. Restructuring an agency at the same time of\n            implementation is challenging. The development of human\n            capital to an acceptable and stable stage is a continuous\n            process. It is therefore essential for the GoR and\n            development partners to continue providing support to build\n            RTDA\u2019s capacity as discussed in paragraph 86 above, to\n            enable them establish sustainable management systems and\n            help reduce the turn-around time for project implementation.\n            It is also vital to keep the dynamics of human resource\n            development, inclusive of recruiting and training staff in\n            various disciplines in order to build better capacity for\n            management of the transport infrastructure. This should not\n            be only applicable to the SPIU but the entire RTDA\n            structure. Applying innovative and cost saving methods,\n            including contracting road rehabilitation works under Output\n            and Performance-Based Road Contracting (OPRC) and/or\n            contracting maintenance works for many years is an option\n            that should be practiced to ensure continued maintenance of\n            the classified roads. This is crucial in situations where\n            there are no appropriate measures or adequate financial\n            resources put in place for road maintenance funding,\n            especially in post conflict countries."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Rwanda - Transport Sector Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Rwanda - Transport Sector\n            Development
