Some lessons learned includes: a five-year\n            project lifespan may not be adequate for regional\n            biodiversity projects. Regional projects should have a\n            realistic implementation time frame that takes into account\n            the inherent challenges of coordination/ logistics across\n            countries/jurisdictions. In biodiversity/ conservation\n            projects, adequate time is needed to ensure there is a clear\n            understanding among all stakeholders of the functions of\n            protected areas, how livelihoods and surrounding communities\n            can benefit, and implications for Protected Area (PA)\n            management and reporting. Using a coordinating implementing\n            agency helps in the harmonization of policies on\n            biodiversity conservation and protected area management.\n            Equally, there is need for mandate and budget resources for\n            national staff to internalize the regional priorities. The\n            OECS Secretariat played a critical role in the overall\n            management of this regional biodiversity project providing\n            key functions relating to harmonization, coordination,\n            technical assistance (such as procurement and financial\n            management), training, awareness raising/communication, and\n            monitoring and evaluation. Biodiversity conservation and\n            protected areas management requires intersectoral\n            cooperation. Institutionalization of activities contributes\n            to sustainability of biodiversity conservation programs and\n            benefits to surrounding communities. Flexibility is\n            important in a dynamic context. Flexibility in project\n            design can make implementation more robust by allowing\n            projects to take advantage of opportunities as they arise\n            and to modify the structure and nature of project elements\n            if needed. Technical skills mix is crucial for the quality\n            of project design and implementation. The technical inputs\n            throughout a project's life are often the critical\n            elements to ensuring the intended outcomes. Address capacity\n            issues early in project life. Regional projects inherently\n            have logistical complexities, especially in countries with\n            low technical and administrative capacities. Investments in\n            training and capacity building should be made early to\n            strengthen counterpart implementation capacity relating to\n            technical and fiduciary specialties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\n            (OECS) - Protected Areas and Associated Livelihood Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Organization of

During project\n            implementation there will be no involuntary physical\n            displacement, or resettlement of persons from project\n            selected protected areas. However, some livelihood\n            activities could potentially be impacted due, for example,\n            to the limiting of fishing areas through zoning, limiting\n            fish catches, or restricting certain fishing, and\n            agricultural practices in sensitive areas. This Process\n            Framework outlines the criteria, and procedures that the\n            project will follow to ensure that eligible, affected\n            persons are assisted in their efforts to restore or improve\n            their livelihoods in an integral, environmental process,\n            fair, just, and in accordance with local laws, and\n            consistent with the Bank's Policies on Involuntary\n            Resettlement (OP 4.12) and Natural Habitats (OP 4.04). The\n            project activities for mitigating potential, nonphysical\n            displacement would target local low-income communities that\n            neighbor and use natural resources. Following the objectives\n            of the social assessment, activities should: carry out a\n            stakeholder analysis, and, consultations with stakeholders;\n            abide by the baseline socio-economic conditions, emphasizing\n            natural resource use issues; evaluate social criteria for\n            site pre-selection, and identify key issues for the human\n            communities (both opportunities and potential conflicts or\n            problems) to contribute to site specific action plans, to be\n            developed under the project.  The project's Component 2\n            - Protected Areas and Associated Alternative Livelihood\n            Opportunities - includes facilitating and financing\n            sustainable livelihood subprojects with communities living\n            in and around the targeted PAs. In addition, Component 3 -\n            Capacity Building for Conservation Planning and Management -\n            will include technical assistance, and training\n            opportunities supporting, and developing future, sustainable\n            livelihood activities."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Organization of Eastern Caribbean States\n            (OECS) -
