The lessons learned indicate that the\n            standby lending operations can be better suited than\n            crisis-reactive loans under some circumstances, particularly\n            when the purpose of the former is to prevent crises from\n            developing in the first place. While emergency lending, such\n            as that provided by the Repurchase Facility Support Loan\n            (RFSL), should include terms and conditions that do reflect\n            the riskier credit conditions under which is made, it should\n            be also taken into account the future ability of the\n            receiving country to service such debt. Alternative\n            disbursement scenarios of transaction-based\n            standby/contingent loans require to be carefully analyzed,\n            including an assessment of the Bank's marginal\n            contribution. Financial enhancements provided by the Bank\n            need to be commensurate with the financial leverage. In the\n            case of the RFSL, the lesson is that the amount disbursed by\n            the Bank should have been probably tied to the size of the\n            repo facility and/or the amounts effectively disbursed by\n            participating international banks."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Argentina -
