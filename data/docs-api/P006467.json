The overall outcome of the project is rated as\n            satisfactory; the performance of the Bank and the borrower\n            was rated satisfactory. The Third Agricultural Research\n            Project aimed to support the execution, dissemination, and\n            assessment of the results of research programs designed to\n            contribute to the formulation of sustainable agricultural\n            production systems in two distinct agro-ecological areas.\n            The project will also strengthen the capacity of Brazilian\n            Agricultural Research Corporation Empresa Brasileira de\n            Pesquisa Agropecuaria (EMBRAPA) and the state research\n            agencies to generate and disseminate technology, and\n            increase the efficiency of the system of cooperative\n            agricultural research between EMBRAPA and state governments\n            in the Northeast through the adjustment of the ongoing\n            research programs and the definition of appropriate\n            procedures to consolidate these programs under the aegis of\n            EMBRAPA. The major lesson learned from the project is that a\n            maturing agricultural research organization can be expected\n            to apply external funding effectively provided that: (a) the\n            government remains committed to its future; (b) it has\n            forward-looking management; (c) it has adequately skilled\n            and rewarded staff; and (d) it has a flexible lending\n            partner. When dealing with such borrowers, the Bank's\n            role, beyond supplying funds, should focus throughout the\n            project cycle on ensuring these
