One of the project's major\n            components includes:  (a) financing of imports of spare\n            parts and raw materials for selected efficient, private and\n            public industrial enterprises. The funds (US$33.5 million\n            equivalent) would be sold to approved industrial enterprises\n            through the existing commercial bank network.  The banks\n            would receive a commission of 0.5 percent of the amount of\n            the transactions.  The project would further; (b) finance\n            equipment for the rehabilitation of a selected group of\n            enterprises; and (c) provide technical assistance to the\n            Ministry
