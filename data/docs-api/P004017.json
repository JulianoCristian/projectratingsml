Both World\n            Bank and Borrower performances are assessed as satisfactory.\n            Lessons learned included the following: Putting resources in\n            the hands of directors at the individual research units\n            increased efficiency, created greater diversification and\n            breadth and enhanced disciplinary specialization and depth.\n            A peer review process can be developed and used which, in a\n            transparent and consistent manner, can review proposals and\n            allocated funds in a way that is perceived by the academic\n            community to be fair and equitable. Providing seed money for\n            young scholars who received degrees aboard kept them in\n            their institutions engaged in research and teaching rather\n            than losing them to the domestic consultants industry. Small\n            amounts of funds used to upgrade staff from remote\n            institutions allows them to compete for entry into more\n            prestigious institutions and this is a more successful\n            approach than offering incentives to graduates from premier\n            institutions. Project management must be treated with the\n            same level of seriousness and professional judgment as is\n            selection of research program directors. The proper\n            selection and continuous training of project management\n            staff is of critical importance to running scientific\n            research units and avoiding the type of financial problem\n            that developed at the end of the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -
