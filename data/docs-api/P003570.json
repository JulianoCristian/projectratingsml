Overall, the\n            World Bank's performance is assessed as satisfactory,\n            despite the lack of attention to the implementation of some\n            of the policy components in the \"middle years\" of\n            the project. Overall, Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            However, there were some significant procurement delays and\n            perhaps of even greater concern, the lack of recognition of\n            the importance of safeguard issues during the early years of\n            project implementation. There are four important lessons\n            cited in this report. First, if the Bank expects to\n            influence reform and change, it must make a long-term\n            commitment, and build a long-term relationship with its\n            client agencies. Genuine railway reform takes time in most\n            countries. Second, the Bank should never lose sight of the\n            fact that economic or political factors well beyond the\n            scope of this project can be major determinants of project\n            success or failure. Third, a very large project with many\n            investments and institutional development components will be\n            expensive for both the Bank and our clients to manage and\n            supervise. Finally, the client must fully appreciate the\n            importance and value of the Bank's safeguard policies\n            at the project. The Bank aggravated the problem by\n            continually \"raising the bar.\""},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Sixth Railway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Sixth Railway

and management initiatives;\n            (b) institutional development of the railway system; (c)\n            expansion of railway capacity; and (d) modernization of\n            railway technology on a systemwide basis.  The project\n            consists of:  (1) a policy component, comprising:  (a) the\n            application of the decision support system to determine\n            high-priority capacity expansion projects, and optimize\n            future railway investments programs; as well as (b) the\n            formulation and implementation of measures and plans to\n            rationalize the railway tariff system; (2) an investment\n            component, including:  (a) a capacity expansion subcomponent\n            comprising electrification of two major railway corridors;\n            (b) three systemwide technological modernization\n            subcomponents; and (c) a pilot container transport\n            subcomponent covering two main railway corridors; and (3) a\n            technical assistance component, including the preparation\n            and implementation of action plans for:  (a) expanding and\n            modernizing railway container transport services; (b)\n            implementing more cost-effective railway technology to\n            increase railway capacity at lower cost; and (c)\n            strengthening MOR's environmental protection capability\n            and solving some of its most pressing environmental problems."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Sixth Railway Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Sixth Railway Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1993/02/735219/china-sixth-railway-project","projn":"CN-Railway Vi -- P003570","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Early Child and Children's Health,Environmental Economics & Policies,Roads & Highways,Railways Transport,Banks & Banking Reform","teratopic":"Transport","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"East Asia!$!80460"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3961003215417"},"subsc":"Railways,Central government administration","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            standards,Afforestation,air pollution,air pollution\n            control,autonomy,Bicycles,BOTTLENECK,bottlenecks,capital\n            expenditures,carbon,Cement,Civil works,coal,construction\n            sites,diesel locomotives,district governments,economic\n            growth,emissions,environmental impacts,environmental\n            problems,environmental protection,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,Expressway,financial planning,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,Forestry,framework,freight,freight\n            traffic,freight wagons,imports,institutional\n            development,land\n            acquisition,locomotives,marketing,MARSHALLING YARDS,net\n            present value,net value,passenger,passenger\n            coaches,pollution control,power plants,PRC,present\n            value,productivity,rail,RAILROAD,RAILROADS,Railway,railway\n            capacity,railway equipment,railway infrastructure,railway\n            lines,railway network,railway operation,railway\n            operations,railway policy,Railway Project,railway\n            projects,railway services,railway system,railway\n            tariffs,railway technology,railway track,railway\n            transport,Railways,rate of return,resource\n            allocation,rolling stock,routes,Sanitation,Soils,technical\n            assistance,Technology\n            transfers,terrain,track,transportation,tunnels,Waste\n            Disposal,Water Supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"accounting,accounting\n            standards,Afforestation,air pollution,air pollution\n            control,autonomy,Bicycles,BOTTLENECK,bottlenecks,capital\n            expenditures,carbon,Cement,Civil works,coal,construction\n            sites,diesel locomotives,district governments,economic\n            growth,emissions,environmental impacts,environmental\n            problems,environmental protection,exchange\n            rate,expenditures,Expressway,financial planning,FISCAL\n            YEAR,foreign exchange,Forestry,framework,freight,freight\n            traffic,freight wagons,imports,institutional\n            development,land\n            acquisition,locomotives,marketing,MARSHALLING YARDS,net\n            present value,net value,passenger,passenger\n            coaches,pollution control,power plants,PRC,present\n            value,productivity,rail,RAILROAD,RAILROADS,Railway,railway\n            capacity,railway equipment,railway infrastructure,railway\n            lines,railway network,railway operation,railway\n            operations,railway policy,Railway Project,railway\n            projects,railway services,railway system,railway\n            tariffs,railway technology,railway track,railway\n            transport,Railways,rate of return,resource\n            allocation,rolling stock,routes,Sanitation,Soils,technical\n            assistance,Technology\n            transfers,terrain,track,transportation,tunnels,Waste\n            Disposal,Water Supply"}},"owner":"Trnsprt, Energy & Mining Sector (EASTE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"East Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"East Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF020345-SIXTH RAILWAY PROJECT","repnb":"P5948"},"facets":{}}}
