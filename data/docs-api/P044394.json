Some lessons\n            learned included: the design of an emergency reconstruction\n            project should be simple and such that implementation can be\n            accomplished quickly and benefits generated without an undue\n            gestation period, as was the case with this project.\n            Provision should be made for engaging technical assistance\n            as needed from preparation through the first year of\n            implementation. Even under pressures of an emergency, it is\n            preferable to carefully canvass the beneficiaries concerning\n            their specific needs and preferences and procure goods and\n            services that match these as closely as possible. Where\n            required accompanying measures, such as extension advice,\n            inputs, operating credit or marketing assistance, cannot be\n            included, which is often the case
