Implementation of the project, was\n            fraught with problems almost from the onset. With little\n            movement on the ground, by the end of 1992 it became\n            apparent that there were major problems of communication and\n            coordination between the two ministries. Efforts to\n            restructure project management in 1993 to provide for\n            greater autonomy of action, and budgets, for the Ministries\n            of Agriculture (MOA) were to no avail. Throughout the period\n            of implementation, Lesotho went through periods of political\n            instability due to events both endogenous and exogenous (in\n            particular the momentous changes occurring in the Republic\n            of South Africa). This instability affected project\n            implementation through changes in governmental structures\n            and the ability to take consistent decisions regarding the\n            role of chiefs and the powers of the Development Councils,\n            as well as amendments to land legislation. In the last years\n            of the project, the resurgence of democracy brought to the\n            local level a new factionalism based on political\n            affiliation. Any assessment of project implementation must\n            take into account the underlying political conditions\n            prevailing in Lesotho."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Land Management and Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho -

To this end, the\n            project will strengthen ; (a) MICARD (Ministry of Interior,\n            Chieftainship Affairs and Rural Development) through\n            technical assistance, training and logistical support to\n            enable them to assist the councils, and (b) MOA's\n            (Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperatives and Marketing)\n            Institute of Land Use Planning to enable it to put together\n            working groups in the districts to help local communities to\n            prepare and implement land management plans. Also financed\n            will be land management subprojects (such as pasture\n            improvement, conservation works, tree planting) approved by\n            the district councils. Finally, the project will provide\n            assistance in the further development of a land policy for\n            the Kingdom."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Land Management and Conservation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho - Land Management and\n            Conservation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1988/03/739050/lesotho-land-management-conservation-project","projn":"LS-Land Mgt.&Conserv. -- P001390","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Wetlands,Environmental Economics & Policies,Land Use and Policies,Forestry,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Lesotho","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960926192123"},"subsc":"(Historic)Agriculture adjustment","admreg":"Africa,Africa","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            land,agricultural lands,agricultural marketing,Agricultural\n            Production,Agricultural Sector,Agriculture,allocation of\n            land,animal husbandry,animal production,arable land,arable\n            lands,better land management,climate,coal,communal\n            land,conservation of land,Cooperatives,crop\n            production,cropland,crops,decentralization,drought,Economic\n            Development,economic effects,economic\n            growth,Employment,environmental degradation,environmental\n            protection,Equipment,Erosion,Erosion Control,erosion\n            prevention,farmers,financial\n            resources,fodder,Forestry,Forestry\n            Division,fruit,GNP,grazing lands,grazing reserves,grazing\n            rights,groundwater,Housing,imports,impoundment,improved\n            land,income,labor force,land allocation,Land\n            Conservation,land degradation,Land Management,land\n            ownership,Land Policy,land quality,land registration,land\n            resource management,Land Resources,Land Tenure,Land Use,land\n            use patterns,Land Use Planning,land use plans,land use\n            practices,land users,legislation,Livestock,Livestock\n            Products,Local\n            Authorities,Marketing,mines,nutrition,overgrazing,pastures,plains,planting,plots,ploughing,policy\n            environment,population growth,population pressures,private\n            property,productivity,rainfall,rangelands,regeneration,reservoirs,Resource\n            Management,Resources Management,Rural Development,social\n            costs,Soil Conservation,soil\n            erosion,soils,taxation,trees,veterinary services,water\n            resources,Watershed,Watershed Management,Wind erosion"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,agricultural\n            land,agricultural lands,agricultural marketing,Agricultural\n            Production,Agricultural Sector,Agriculture,allocation of\n            land,animal husbandry,animal production,arable land,arable\n            lands,better land management,climate,coal,communal\n            land,conservation of land,Cooperatives,crop\n            production,cropland,crops,decentralization,drought,Economic\n            Development,economic effects,economic\n            growth,Employment,environmental degradation,environmental\n            protection,Equipment,Erosion,Erosion Control,erosion\n            prevention,farmers,financial\n            resources,fodder,Forestry,Forestry\n            Division,fruit,GNP,grazing lands,grazing reserves,grazing\n            rights,groundwater,Housing,imports,impoundment,improved\n            land,income,labor force,land allocation,Land\n            Conservation,land degradation,Land Management,land\n            ownership,Land Policy,land quality,land registration,land\n            resource management,Land Resources,Land Tenure,Land Use,land\n            use patterns,Land Use Planning,land use plans,land use\n            practices,land users,legislation,Livestock,Livestock\n            Products,Local\n            Authorities,Marketing,mines,nutrition,overgrazing,pastures,plains,planting,plots,ploughing,policy\n            environment,population growth,population pressures,private\n            property,productivity,rainfall,rangelands,regeneration,reservoirs,Resource\n            Management,Resources Management,Rural Development,social\n            costs,Soil Conservation,soil\n            erosion,soils,taxation,trees,veterinary services,water\n            resources,Watershed,Watershed Management,Wind erosion"}},"owner":"WB Off:Pretoria - Southern AFR 1 (AFCS1)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"repnb":"6964"},"facets":{}}}
