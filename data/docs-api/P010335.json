The\n            project has achieved most of its objectives, its impact on\n            institutional development has been partially successful,\n            sustainability is likely, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, while the project achieved\n            its physical targets due in large measure to its basic and\n            simple formulation, the introduction of design variants to\n            deal more effectively with geographic differences in climate\n            and class size might have improved the final product.\n            Second, if regular government employees are not motivated or\n            capable of undertaking complex temporary assignments\n            involving protracted field work, it is possible to\n            successfully utilize competent, contracted staff, supported\n            by a decentralized management structure. Third, while\n            community participation is critical in an activity such as\n            school construction in Nepal, it is important to avoid\n            applying uniform expectations across all groups, since not\n            all communities may be able or sufficiently interested in\n            participation. Finally, when the Government is reluctant to\n            use credit resources for technical assistance, an IDA\n            project is likely to perform better when complemented by a\n            grant component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nepal - Earthquake Schools Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nepal - Earthquake Schools\n            Rehabilitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/04/731976/nepal-earthquake-schools-rehabilitation-project","projn":"NP-Earthqk School Rehab -- P010335","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Construction Industry,Roads & Highways,Primary Education,Teaching and Learning","teratopic":"Transport","count":"Nepal","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!80451"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970818101725"},"subsc":"(Historic)Other education","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Transport","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Achievement,architectural design,basic\n            education,bridges,building design,cement,classroom\n            construction,classroom size,classrooms,climate,community\n            involvement,community\n            participation,construction,construction\n            materials,construction methods,construction sites,decision\n            making,depots,doors,education facilities,education\n            officers,floors,framework,head\n            teachers,homes,hospitals,Housing,iron,leadership,learning,local\n            authorities,masonry,medical\n            treatment,mortar,Motivation,mud,Primary Education,primary\n            schools,psychology,public buildings,public\n            schools,reinforcement,roads,roofing,school buildings,school\n            construction,school management,school rehabilitation,school\n            structures,Schools,speed,steel,structural members,terrain,transport,transportation,trucks,vehicles,walls,windows,Zinc"},"1":{"cdata!":"Achievement,architectural design,basic\n            education,bridges,building design,cement,classroom\n            construction,classroom size,classrooms,climate,community\n            involvement,community\n            participation,construction,construction\n            materials,construction methods,construction sites,decision\n            making,depots,doors,education facilities,education\n            officers,floors,framework,head\n            teachers,homes,hospitals,Housing,iron,leadership,learning,local\n            authorities,masonry,medical\n            treatment,mortar,Motivation,mud,Primary Education,primary\n            schools,psychology,public buildings,public\n            schools,reinforcement,roads,roofing,school buildings,school\n            construction,school management,school rehabilitation,school\n            structures,Schools,speed,steel,structural members,terrain,transport,transportation,trucks,vehicles,walls,windows,Zinc"}},"owner":"S.A.
