Strong implementation\n            and supervision presence throughout program execution is\n            necessary, in order to identify problems at an early stage\n            to allow for immediate and appropriate action. A well\n            functioning monitoring and up-to-date data management system\n            is crucial in this respect. The incorporation of lessons\n            learned from earlier emergency operations (in particular,\n            Bosnia) strongly improved the design of the project and it\n            was evident during project implementation. Thorough design,\n            especially of targeting and monitoring, is important for\n            good emergency operations. Timely follow-up activities\n            should be planned to turn successful emergency measures into\n            sustained development. The establishment of institutions,\n            like the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL), is\n            very challenging in a post-conflict environment. Capacity\n            building can work. It requires time and commitment to both\n            in-country training (including on administrative procedures)\n            and overseeing study tours and training courses. Targeted\n            beneficiary selection in a post-conflict environment can\n            work very successfully. Strong involvement of local\n            institutions and communication of the process are key. The\n            carefully chosen beneficiary selection process and its\n            successful implementation show that using a democratic\n            process to select beneficiaries and to use beneficiary\n            pressure to ensure compliance with project goals can be\n            effective. More flexibility on the procurement in the\n            machinery component might have resulted in more impact of\n            the component. The cost recovery program for new machinery\n            was well-designed and provides a good example for future\n            projects. Participation, involvement and cooperation with\n            counterparts were critical for capacity building."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Serbia and Montenegro (Kosovo) - Emergency\n            Farm Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Serbia and Montenegro (Kosovo) -\n            Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/12/2850749/serbia-montenegro-kosovo-emergency-farm-reconstruction-project","projn":"XK-Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project -- P069325","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Livestock and Animal Husbandry,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Economic Theory & Research,Agricultural Research,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Agriculture","count":"Kosovo","entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20040108095652"},"subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Animal production,Agro-industry","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Agriculture","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            extension,agricultural production,agricultural\n            trade,Agriculture,Animal,Animal Health,animal health\n            services,animal husbandry,Animal Identification,Animal\n            production,animals,Artificial Insemination,artificial\n            insemination services,breeding,bulls,calves,Capacity\n            Building,cattle,Cattle,Cattle\n            Herd,cows,crop,cropping,cropping\n            seasons,cultivation,dairy,dairy\n            cattle,damages,DATES,development policies,development\n            strategy,diseases,Dogs,FAO,Farm,farm buildings,Farm\n            machinery,farmers,farms,feed,feeding,Fertilizers,food\n            imports,food insecurity,food\n            security,Forestry,Goats,harvesters,herds,Horses,housing,Hunger,IFDC,improved\n            breeds,irrigation,Livestock,livestock disease,livestock\n            industry,livestock owner,livestock production,livestock\n            sector,meat,meat production,milk,milk production,national\n            herd,National Livestock,NGOs,Nongovernmental\n            Organizations,overhead costs,pedigree,Pigs,private\n            sector,private veterinarians,ruminant nutrition,Rural\n            Development,Rural markets,rural\n            population,sheep,Sheep,smallholders,Spring,Sustainable\n            Development,Technical Assistance,trade policies,UNITED\n            NATIONS,Veterinary,veterinary care,veterinary\n            equipment,veterinary practitioners,veterinary\n            profession,Veterinary Service,veterinary services,veterinary\n            specialists,veterinary stations,veterinary\n            technicians,vets,water resources,wheat,winter wheat"},"1":{"cdata!":"agricultural development,Agricultural\n            extension,agricultural production,agricultural\n            trade,Agriculture,Animal,Animal Health,animal health\n            services,animal husbandry,Animal Identification,Animal\n            production,animals,Artificial Insemination,artificial\n            insemination services,breeding,bulls,calves,Capacity\n            Building,cattle,Cattle,Cattle\n            Herd,cows,crop,cropping,cropping\n            seasons,cultivation,dairy,dairy\n            cattle,damages,DATES,development policies,development\n            strategy,diseases,Dogs,FAO,Farm,farm buildings,Farm\n            machinery,farmers,farms,feed,feeding,Fertilizers,food\n            imports,food insecurity,food\n            security,Forestry,Goats,harvesters,herds,Horses,housing,Hunger,IFDC,improved\n            breeds,irrigation,Livestock,livestock disease,livestock\n            industry,livestock owner,livestock production,livestock\n            sector,meat,meat production,milk,milk production,national\n            herd,National Livestock,NGOs,Nongovernmental\n            Organizations,overhead costs,pedigree,Pigs,private\n            sector,private veterinarians,ruminant nutrition,Rural\n            Development,Rural markets,rural\n            population,sheep,Sheep,smallholders,Spring,Sustainable\n            Development,Technical Assistance,trade policies,UNITED\n            NATIONS,Veterinary,veterinary care,veterinary\n            equipment,veterinary practitioners,veterinary\n            profession,Veterinary Service,veterinary services,veterinary\n            specialists,veterinary stations,veterinary\n            technicians,vets,water resources,wheat,winter wheat"}},"owner":"Sustainable Devmt Sector Unit (ECSSD)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"trustfund":"TF023448-KOSOVO-PROJECT PREPARATION\n            GRANT FOR THE EMERGENCY FARM RECONSTRUCTION,TF023546-EMERGENCY FARM RECONSTRUCTION\n            PROJECT -

The project has five components: 1)\n            The first component will provide support to re-establishing\n            the national cattle herd through the procurement of 2,300\n            cattle. 2) Rehabilitation of veterinary services will be\n            implemented through the United Nations Food and Agriculture\n            Organization (FAO) Project Management Team. Private\n            veterinarians will be supported in equipment and drugs, and\n            the support to public veterinary services will include the\n            establishment of central and regional veterinary diagnostic\n            laboratories, as well as a facility to ensure artificial\n            insemination services. 3) Farm machinery repair and\n            replacement will help rebuild the power capacity for\n            agricultural production through a tractor repair program and\n            the distribution of new equipment. 4) Agriculture policy\n            capacity building will support the technical assistance of\n            the Department of Agriculture in agriculture trade polices,\n            and preparation for investments in irrigation rehabilitation\n            in the near term. 5) Project management will support a team\n            made up of local and international staff and will work\n            closely with non-governmental organizations."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -\n            Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kosovo, Federal Republic of\n            Yugoslavia -
