The lessons learned indicate that the\n            Learning and Innovation Loan (LILs) may need a longer term\n            to deal with uncertainties attendant to their innovative\n            designs: The original term of the Market Development Project\n            (CMDP) was 2\ufffd years, however, due to delays the project\n            required 4\ufffd years to complete. LILs, in general, may need\n            more time than investment projects of a similar scope and\n            nature. The development of legislation and training of\n            government staff should have preceded the investment\n            component: While the exchanges were provided with a vision\n            of how a modern commodity exchange works, as well as part of\n            the funding needed to upgrade their operations, they have so\n            far been unable to implement key parts of this vision\n            involving physical investment (e.g., establishment of bonded\n            warehouses, a Warehouse Receipt System (WRS), and\n            corporatization of the exchanges) in the absence of enabling\n            legislation and better regulatory capacity. The Project\n            Implementation Unit (PIU) and necessary financial management\n            systems should have been established prior to project\n            effectiveness: As noted above, initial arrangements for\n            staffing the PIU, as well as establishment of financial\n            management systems and training in procurement were\n            inadequate, which hindered project progress. In a situation\n            where major policy change is starting to occur, a small\n            investment project can be highly leveraged and facilitate\n            change: As noted earlier, the CMDP was implemented in lieu\n            of a much larger investment project. For a small investment,\n            the project facilitated policy change in the area of\n            commodity markets, which in turn encouraged reforms in other areas."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -

Third, project impact\n            evaluation will cover trade at participating exchanges,\n            off-exchange trade within the catchment area of\n            participating exchanges; and market integration and price\n            convergence between participating exchanges."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
