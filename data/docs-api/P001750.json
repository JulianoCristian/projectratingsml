Lessons cited from this\n            project include: 1) Delegating management contracts to\n            qualified and experienced agencies remains one of the best\n            options to deliver infrastructure services quickly and\n            effectively. 2) Municipal contracts are useful tools to\n            improve performance of local governments but need to be\n            monitored to be meaningful. 3) Using private sector\n            approaches can provide improvement in urban land management\n            and streamline urban land titling. 4) Cultural heritage\n            operations are complex by themselves and adding them as a\n            component of a project increases complexity. 5) Achieving\n            infrastructure outputs may not lead to sustainable outcomes\n            when capacity building is compromised.  6) Urban operations\n            are complex by themselves and require long periods of\n            implementation that exceed the five year period that has\n            been the norm."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali -
