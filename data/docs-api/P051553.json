Some lessons\n            learned includes: while good project design makes the links\n            between project interventions and outcomes explicit through\n            a results-chain, the rationale for attribution needs to have\n            a sound theoretical foundation and appropriate performance\n            indicators. Urban infrastructure investments in sanitation\n            and drainage can produce outputs that contribute to\n            generalized project objectives, such as reduced\n            environmental pollution and flooding, but the links can be\n            complex and difficult to monitor. Achievements can only be\n            accurately measured when baselines are clear and data are\n            current on all relevant performance indicators. The project\n            showed that urban households were satisfied with the septic\n            tanks provided, regarding them as adequate final solutions\n            to their sanitation needs, making connections to local sewer\n            networks appear unnecessary to these households. As Vietnam\n            continues to urbanize rapidly, sector specialists will need\n            to monitor how well the household septic tank solution\n            continues to perform with increasing urban densities. At the\n            same time, the specialists would need to identify the\n            incentives that households might need to eventually move to\n            systemic solutions for urban sanitation. Dissemination and\n            dialogue among stakeholders can be more intense and\n            effective during discussion of preliminary findings and\n            recommendations than after the submission of a report in its\n            final version at the completion of the task, as the 2010\n            workshop in Hanoi demonstrated in this case."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -

Some lessons learned included: 1) the\n            project successfully introduced the concept of user pay in\n            the sector. However, cost recovery targets proved to be too\n            ambitious and did not adequately account for the slow pace\n            of change in the legal framework and the risk of economic\n            crisis slowing plans to raise fees; 2) slow uptake of house\n            connections by households in the project areas has reduced\n            the efficacy of the sewerage system installed under the\n            project.

Adequate resources need to be mobilized for\n            achieving satisfactory performance; and 5) the valuable\n            lessons on building the capability and services of\n            sanitation and drainage companies need to be captured in a\n            systematic manner to guide future projects."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam - Three Cities Sanitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam - Three Cities Sanitation Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2009/06/10849214/vietnam-three-cities-sanitation-project","projn":"VN-Three Cities Sanitation Project -- P051553","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Urban Water Supply and Sanitation,Housing & Human Habitats,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","count":"Vietnam","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333038_20090722010847"},"theme":"Environmental policies and institutions,Pollution management and environmental health,Other urban development,Municipal governance and institution building,Municipal finance","subsc":"Flood protection,Solid waste management,Sewerage,Sanitation,Other industry","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Communities and Human Settlements","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Industry and trade","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"basic urban services, billing, Biochemical\n            Oxygen Demand, BOD, CITIES, collection activities,\n            collection trucks, combined sewers, commercialization,\n            communicable diseases, compactors, connection, Construction,\n            Cost Benefit Analysis, cost savings, Description,\n            desludging, Drainage, drains, drinking water, Economic\n            Analysis, economic development, Economics, effective\n            sanitation, effective strategy, efficient operation,\n            Electricity, emissions, Engineer, Environmental,\n            Environmental Management, Environmental policies,\n            environmental protection, environmental sanitation, female,\n            flood control, Gender, Groundwater, house connections,\n            household connections, Household Sanitation, households,\n            hygiene, inadequate sanitation, incidence of water, income,\n            inflation, institutional change, interceptor sewers,\n            intervention, interventions, investment in water supply,\n            lakes, leachate, leachate treatment, legislation, litter,\n            living conditions, local authorities, market prices, Natural\n            Resources, neighborhoods, number of household connections,\n            Operation &amp;

The location of the Halong landfill\n            component will not cause any serious negative impacts on\n            natural flora and fauna, though care must be taken to not\n            endanger the local drinking water source. The drainage and\n            sewerage system in Halong will have an overall positive\n            impact, especially in the aquatic and human environment,\n            although to insure this, mitigation measures including water\n            control and leachate management must be implemented. The\n            Haiphong component will improve the overall urban\n            sanitation, positively affecting the human and aquatic\n            environment, although untreated waste water discharge will\n            continue the contamination of river water. Mitigation of\n            this would include the installation and regular de-sludging\n            of septic tanks connected to sewers."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Danang - additional works : detailed design report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Vietnam -
