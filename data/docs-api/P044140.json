Lessons learned include: the Bank strategy to\n            continue supporting ACUACAR (Aguas de Cartagena - the water\n            and sewerage company of Cartagena) through the project was\n            instrumental to consolidate the sector reform initiated in\n            Cartagena under a previous Bank operation, and to establish\n            the needed credibility of the mixed enterprise model.\n            ACUACAR's notable improvements in the quality and\n            access of water and sewerage provision coupled with\n            providing wastewater treatment and adequate disposal have\n            significantly increased the well being of the population.\n            Providing wastewater collection, treatment and disposal to a\n            large urban city in a developing country is a complex and\n            challenging endeavor requiring careful design and technical\n            expertise to provide an adequate wastewater management\n            system using a strategy of minimum cost that considers\n            financial and economic limitations, but is also protective\n            of the environment. Even through the project was well\n            prepared technically; implementation took over a decade due\n            to complications in obtaining the environmental license,\n            local opposition to the outfall solution. Complex projects\n            should include inclusive and extensive consultations with\n            stakeholders to explain objectives, design, approach and\n            benefits. A comprehensive communication strategy, to create\n            a better understanding of the project and dissipate\n            erroneous information, and promised activities that benefit\n            the affected population should be conducted at an early\n            stage during project implementation. The mixed enterprise\n            ACUACAR model has proved to have a dramatic impact on the\n            lives of the poor in Cartagena. The resources for expanding\n            coverage in poor areas were generated mainly from efficiency\n            improvements and subsidies, with only minor increases in tariffs."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Colombia - Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage\n            and Environmental Management Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia - Cartagena Water\n            Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/06/12619126/colombia-cartagena-water-supply-sewerage-environmental-management-project","projn":"CO-Cartagena Wtr Supply & Sewerage Env.\n            -- P044140","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Conservation,Water and Industry,Sanitation and Sewerage","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20100805002944"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sewerage,Sanitation","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to safe water, adequate wastewater\n            disposal, affluent, avoided costs, basic sanitation, basins,\n            Biochemical Oxygen Demand, BOD, canals, central government,\n            channel, channels, clean-up, COD, coliforms, collection\n            system, community participation, conservation, construction,\n            contaminants, continuity of service, cost savings,\n            counterpart funding, creeks, Cubic meter, disposal systems,\n            Dissolved Oxygen, domestic wastewater, drainage system,\n            drinking water, drinking water supply, effluent, effluent\n            discharge, environmental benefits, environmental\n            degradation, environmental impacts, ENVIRONMENTAL\n            MANAGEMENT, Financial Viability, fishing, grease, High\n            levels, household connection, households, industrial wastes,\n            industrial wastewater, land tenure, land use, least cost,\n            local authorities, local communities, low income\n            communities, low-income households, low-income population,\n            marine ecosystems, meter installation, monitoring program,\n            municipalities, Nitrogen, number of connections, Operation\n            &amp;

The key to success in the Colombian water\n            sector reform has been the development of homegrown\n            solutions, and at times, skillfully adapting models used\n            elsewhere to the particular circumstances and culture of\n            Colombia. As a result, Colombia has made substantial\n            progress in the expansion of water supply and sanitation\n            (WSS) services. By 2002, urban water supply access was 99\n            percent, rural water supply coverage 71 percent. Sanitation\n            access has also been upgraded with urban coverage of 96\n            percent and rural coverage of 54 percent. Over the years,\n            the World Bank has supported Colombia through advisory work,\n            capacity building and lending.

In regard to\n            poverty alleviation, Management shares the Panel's\n            views on the importance of the Project's poverty\n            related impacts on Cartagena's poor and vulnerable population."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Informe y recomendacion de la administracion\n            en respuesta al informe de la investigacion del Panel de Inspeccion"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Colombia \u2013 Proyecto de Gesti\u00f3n\n            Ambiental y de Suministro de Agua y Saneamiento de Cartagena\n            : Informe y recomendaci\u00f3n de la administraci\u00f3n en respuesta\n            al informe de la investigaci\u00f3n del Panel de Inspecci\u00f3n"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2005/07/7283986/colombia-cartagena-water-supply-sewerage-environmental-management-project-informe-y-recomendacion-de-la-administracion-en-respuesta-al-informe-de-la-investigacion-del-panel-de-inspeccion","projn":"CO-Cartagena Wtr Supply & Sewerage Env.\n            -- P044140","subtopic":"Wastewater Treatment,Environmental Economics & Policies,Pro-Poor Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Conservation,Sanitation and Sewerage","docty":"Inspection Panel Report and Recommendation","teratopic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Colombia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South America!$!80469"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000011823_20061220155102"},"subsc":"General water, sanitation and flood\n            protection sector,Water supply,Sub-national government administration,Sewerage,Sanitation","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"Spanish","historic_topic":"Environment,Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Water, sanitation and flood protection,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"aquifers, bacteria, basins, biological\n            processes, biological treatment, canals, carbon, chemical\n            processes, chlorination, comparative analysis, Construction,\n            contaminants, contingent valuation, contingent valuation\n            method, coral reefs, cost analysis, cost savings, debt,\n            dissolved oxygen, drainage, Economic analysis, economic\n            development, Effluent discharge, effluent quality,\n            ENVIRONMENTAL, environmental benefits, environmental\n            cleanup, ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, environmental problems,\n            eutrophication, Exchange Rate, externalities, fishers,\n            fishing, grease, grit removal, health conditions, Income,\n            Industrial Wastewater, irrigation, irrigation water,\n            lagoons, land application, mangroves, marine environment,\n            Monitoring program, municipal management, nitrogen,\n            nutrients, oil, organic matter, Outfalls, oxidation,\n            particulate, pathogens, piped water, pipes, pollution,\n            population growth, present value, programs, Project\n            Management, public health, pumping, pumping stations,\n            receiving waters, Resources Management, rivers, sanitary\n            conditions, sanitary disposal, sanitation, sanitation\n            infrastructure, sanitation services, savings, screening,\n            sea, sea water, secondary effluents, sedimentation,\n            sedimentation tanks, settleable solids, Sewage, sewage\n            collection, sewage effluent, sewage treatment, sewer\n            services, SEWERAGE, sewers, shoreline, solid wastes, storm\n            water, streams, tertiary treatment, toxic substances, trees,\n            untreated sewage, viruses, Waste, Waste Disposal, wastes,\n            Wastewater, wastewater collection, Wastewater Discharge,\n            Wastewater Disposal, wastewater management, wastewater\n            treatment, wastewaters, water drainage, water quality, Water\n            Quality Impacts, WATER SUPPLY, Water Supply System, water\n            system, wells, Willingness to Pay, WTP"}},"owner":"Water & Sanitation Cluster (LCSFW)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South America"},"1":{"geo_region":"South America"},"2":{"geo_region":"South America"}},"trustfund":"TF029605-PHRD-CARTAGENA WATER SUPPLY,\n            SEWERAGE AND,TF035447-LAC REGION - WASTE WATER\n            MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (ST.
