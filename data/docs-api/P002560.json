The reach of\n            Sudan's modern transport facilities is very limited,\n            leaving vast areas with only primitive means of access. The\n            4,800 km railway system, the principal means of transporting\n            exports and imports to and from Port Sudan, is unable to\n            meet the demands placed upon it. Of the almost 16,000 km of\n            roads, only about 1,700 km mostly in the Khartoum-Port Sudan\n            corridor are paved (only 330 km in 1970); much of the rest\n            of the road network, particularly in the more populated and\n            developed areas, is built on heavy clay soils rendering them\n            impassable during the (June-October) rainy season. River\n            transport is the major surface link to the south, but\n            operational difficulties hinder its efficiency and\n            reliability. Air transport is constrained because most of\n            Sudan's 20 airports are subject to closure during\n            seasonal rains due to soft runways; only Khartoum, Port\n            Sudan and Juba airports are paved; and air traffic control\n            and navigational communications are limited and unreliable."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Sudan -
