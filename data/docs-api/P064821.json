Appropriate axle load legislation, effectively\n            enforced, offers considerable advantages to network\n            sustainability. While focusing capacity building on training\n            of individuals' in-house technical capabilities remains\n            important, addressing institutional incentives and defining\n            organizational responsibilities is necessary to achieving\n            sustainable capacity. A second phase of the APL is under\n            implementation and will (a) bring the road\n            cost-recovery-based financing closer to a sustainable level;\n            (b) enhance the

systems for the sustainable maintenance of the\n            local road network (LRN). There are eight project\n            components. The first component finances periodic\n            maintenance works on various maintainable sections of the\n            NRN and LRN. The second component finances routine emergency\n            works. The third component supports a strategy to reduce\n            overloading on the road network and provides works, weighing\n            equipment and specialized services that promote policy\n            reforms, partnership between the government and the\n            transport industry, and capacity building. The fourth\n            component completes the establishment of the road management\n            system. The fifth component consists of providing\n            specialized consultants that will assist the Road\n            Maintenance Advisory Board and its Secretariat in carrying\n            out their activities. The sixth component develops\n            institutional capacity to manage projects by improving\n            project preparation, execution, and monitoring, and by\n            developing a strategy to improve the performance of the\n            local contracting and consulting industry.

design, and\n            construction, since potential environmental adversity may\n            occur, and, stipulates that if major impacts are identified,\n            an environmental assessment will be prepared, with\n            extensive, and detailed screening criteria. Environmental\n            effects, and mitigation measures are as follows. Road\n            planning, and design should take into account the terrain,\n            and traffic volume, to minimize excessive earthworks, and\n            disruption to local people; which should include an\n            appropriate number of bridges, and culverts, and, the\n            effects of road widening on existing roadside tree-lines,\n            could be reduced by widening only one side, retaining trees\n            on the other. Engineering design should avoid adversity on\n            natural habitats, wildlife, and forestry, as well as\n            cultural heritage sites. Installation of sound barriers, and\n            protective forest belts, will abate noise, and air pollution\n            as a result of construction, while bituminous surfacing will\n            prevent dust pollution, namely on gravel roads sections\n            traversing settlements. Provisions regarding safety, include\n            traffic signaling, safe crossings, and fences. Vegetative\n            propagation will preserve the buffer zone between the road,\n            and surface water bodies, and, adequate design of culverts,\n            and road drainage will be ensured to minimize flooding, and\n            adversity on existing irrigation systems, prevent water\n            contamination, and contain soil erosion.
