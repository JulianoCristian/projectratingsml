Some\n            lessons learned includes: a strong ownership and\n            coordination enabled the implementing agency to address\n            implementation challenges that were critical to the\n            achievement of the development objectives. Pro-activeness in\n            resolving the lack of financial resources was essential to\n            the achievement of the project development objectives.\n            Financial challenges in implementing projects in small\n            countries. Given the size of the country, there is a limit\n            of borrowing from debt sustainability considerations.\n            Technical design of the project activities, related to the\n            upgrade of information systems, should include professional\n            assessment by an Information communication Technology (ICT)\n            specialist to avoid partial upgrade solutions that may be\n            incompatible with or too burdensome for the technical\n            performance capabilities of an old operational system. When\n            costs of activities are estimated, it is essential that the\n            Bank team carry out an analysis of the costs involved: those\n            to be covered from the project proceeds and those additional\n            costs that the government will have to bear as a counterpart\n            contribution. For government counterpart financing, if it is\n            expected to finance project components leading to\n            achievement of development objectives, specific arrangements\n            for disbursements should be worked out and protected through\n            project implementation covenants in order to avoid\n            non-compliance of the government in allocating and\n            disbursing funds.
