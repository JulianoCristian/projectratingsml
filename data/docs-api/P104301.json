Some\n            lessons learned included: as a precautionary measure in\n            fragile countries it may be a good idea to provide\n            additional support to the qualified apex institution in\n            determining eligibility of partner financial institutions\n            due to changing dynamics in the financial sector. Security\n            is a significant factor to consider for the viability of\n            micro or Small or Medium Enterprise (SME) lending. As\n            demonstrated in Afghanistan, the security situation can have\n            a direct negative impact on portfolio quality. As a result,\n            careful assessment should be made prior to rolling out\n            operations in less secure areas. It is interesting to note\n            that the only Microfinance Service Provider (MFP) that is\n            operationally and commercially sustainable is First\n            Microfinance Bank (FMFB), which is also a commercial bank,\n            registered in line with banking regulations, and as such\n            subject to all relevant prudential norms and related
