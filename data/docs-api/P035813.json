Some lessons\n            learned included: (1) given the large attitudinal shift\n            involved in the agricultural transition, government\n            officials and project staff need substantial technical\n            assistance and training before operations can be expected to\n            succeed; (2) in the complex and rapidly changing ECA\n            environment, sound donor coordination was critical; (3) with\n            respect to agriculture and agribusiness services, project\n            experience demonstrated that farmers and rural business\n            owners will respond enthusiastically to innovative\n            technologies corresponding to their needs; (4) on land\n            administration, the Bank\u0092s international experience\n            strengthened the design of projects in ECA, and these\n            projects showed the importance of avoiding a\n            'one-size-fits- all' approach and the sound payoff\n            to adopting a unified approach to develop property registry\n            and cadaster; and (5) the rural finance operations showed\n            that with appropriate regulation, technical advice and staff\n            training banks that lend to rural areas can operate\n            sustainably; also, non-bank financial intermediaries have an\n            important role to play in rural areas; but it is

Ratings for the Agricultural\n            Development and Credit Project for Azerbaijan are as\n            follows: outcome was satisfactory; risk to the development\n            outcome was significant; Bank performance was satisfactory;\n            and Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the projects included: Azerbaijan's\n            largely successful land reform program has been\n            characterized by full and individualized (ownership by\n            families) privatization of land, a package approach\n            combining agricultural services with land reform, and a\n            rapid and single-step change rather than gradual or phased\n            implementation. While the great diversity of experience\n            across countries indicates that there is no uniquely right\n            land reform model, Azerbaijan's approach is an option\n            for other countries to consider. The reform process is\n            critical for determining whether land reform works. In\n            Azerbaijan's case, client focus, transparency, and\n            stakeholder involvement were central to reform\n            implementation, and a learning oriented and innovative\n            culture was fostered. Privatize service delivery reduce\n            requirements for extra government staff. Land reform needs\n            powerful champions to succeed. Exceptional commitment by\n            champions in the Government and the Bank were critical to\n            the success under the projects evaluated here."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Farm

Since independence in 1991 however,\n            unemployment has soared in Azerbaijan and today half of the\n            country's population relies on the agricultural sector\n            for their livelihood, including many who are new to farming.\n            In Ganja District, in the west of the country, families with\n            an average of five people depend on two or three hectares of\n            land. Optimal output on these farms is therefore vital for\n            these families to survive; however many are inexperienced\n            farmers. In order to address this problem, the World\n            Bank-funded Agricultural Development and Credit Project (\n            ADCP) has supported, among other components, the\n            establishment of regional advisory services for farmers.\n            Ganja Business Group (GBG) was contracted by the project in\n            2002 to provide farmers in the western provinces of the\n            country with information on everything from seed quality and\n            pest control to cattle breeding and product packaging. A\n            survey of over 2,000 farmers in the region provided the GBG\n            with an understanding of what concerns needed to be addressed."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Information centers for farmers help boost\n            agricultural output"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Information centers for farmers\n            help boost agricultural output"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2006/02/23922217/information-centers-farmers-help-boost-agricultural-output","count":"Azerbaijan","lang":"English","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural Development, agricultural\n            information, Agricultural Output, agricultural sector,\n            agriculture, equipment, farm, Farmers, farming, farms, feed,\n            fertilizer, hectares of land, Local farmers, pest control,\n            poultry, regional advisory, seed, seeds, tilling, wheat"}},"majtheme":"Public sector governance,Rural development,Environment and natural resource management,Financial and private sector development","topic":"Local and Regional Economic Development\n            m1326938 798,Crop Production m1326627 174,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964","projn":"AZ-Agricultural Development & Credit\n            Project -- P035813","docty":"Brief","subtopic":"Rural Poverty Reduction,Crops and Crop Management Systems,Regional Economic Development,Rural Development Knowledge &\n            Information Systems,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","entityids":{"entityid":"000470435_20150129140522"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Eastern Europe!$!107233"}},"admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","subsc":"Agricultural extension and research,Sub-national government administration,Micro- and SME finance,Central government administration","theme":"Decentralization,Rural services and infrastructure,Rural policies and institutions,Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support,Land administration and management","colti":"Results profile","historic_topic":"Rural Development,Poverty Reduction,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","topicv3":"Local and Regional Economic Development\n            m1326938 798,Crop Production m1326627 174,Rural Poverty and Livelihoods m1326688 1947,Agricultural Innovation Systems m1327588 196,Rural Community Driven Development (CDD)\n            m1325992 1964","owner":"Corporate Communications (ECRCC)","Environmental Category":["B"],"trustfund":"BBFAO-BB FAO,TF020889-SOCIAL SCIENTISTS NETWORK IN\n            CENTRAL ASIA,TF029677-PHRD-AGRICULTURAL DEV.&\n            CREDIT PROJ.,TF036002-AZERBAIJAN - INTERNATIONAL\n            MICRO CREDIT ADVISOR,TF039377-AZERBAIJAN - AGRICULTURAL\n            DEVELOPMENT AND CREDIT PROJECT","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"},"3":{"geo_region":"Eastern Europe"}},"repnb":"92491"},"6871058":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/12/6871058/azerbaijan-agricultural-development-credit-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2005/12/6871058/azerbaijan-agricultural-development-credit-project","new_url":"2005/12/6871058/azerbaijan-agricultural-development-credit-project","disclosure_date":"2006-07-26T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/06/21/000160016_20060621111204/Rendered/INDEX/35935.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/06/21/000160016_20060621111204/Rendered/PDF/35935.pdf","credit_no":"3236","docdt":"2005-12-30T00:00:00Z","datestored":"2006-06-21T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Agricultural Development and\n            Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Azerbaijan Agricultural Development\n            and Credit Project had a satisfactory outcome, is likely to\n            be sustainable, and has a modest institutional development\n            impact. The performances of the Borrower and the Bank are\n            rated satisfactory. Lessons learned included the following:\n            1) In order to manage complicated technical assistance\n            effectively and efficiently, it is important to first\n            develop a capacity and understanding within the Project\n            Implementation Unit of the main features of technical\n            assistance, and international best practice on the subject\n            matter since the risk of failure due to poor technical\n            assistance is great. 2) The Project needs to be selective in\n            the number of monitoring indicators, progress indicators,\n            Adaptable Program Lending triggers, and targets, etc., as\n            management of the too complex monitoring system becomes a\n            cumbersome and time-consuming project activity in itself. 3)\n            For objectives that involve changing the mentality or\n            attitude of Government agency personnel, projects need to\n            include opportunities for gaining international experiences\n            through study tours or conferences. 4) Advantages of a\n            credit line managed by a third party with risk-sharing and\n            co-financing arrangements include: (1) transparency of\n            implementation; (2) careful screening of potential borrowers\n            and thus high repayment rates; and (3) no Government or\n            political influence. There are also disadvantages: (1) the\n            desire to shift disbursement towards the end of the Project\n            in order to minimize its own risk; (2) some initiatives are\n            legitimate from the point of view of the co-financier as a\n            commercial company, but are not in accord with the\n            Project's philosophy or methodology.    The\n            Project's implementation reconfirmed some of the usual\n            lessons from many other projects, such as (1) a very\n            complicated project design consisting of multiple activities\n            should be avoided as it dilutes the focus on the most\n            essential outcome the project attempts to achieve, and makes\n            supervision and implementation extremely costly and time\n            consuming; (2) preparation of the project design should not\n            be short-cut, as any flows in the design ultimately\n            undermine the quality of project implementation and\n            achievements; and (3) expectations for implementation\n            periods of conceptually innovative activities should be\n            based on more realistic assumptions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -

There are four project components. 1) Real\n            estate registration component will support the\n            Government's national program for privatizing and\n            titling state and collective farm land; and develop and\n            implement the organizational and legal framework for a\n            unified real estate cadastre system. 2) Rural finance\n            component will pilot a mechanism to increase the\n            availability in rural areas of market based credit and\n            deposit services for rural households, enterprises, and\n            farms. In particular, the component will establish two types\n            of local financial intermediaries -- credit cooperatives and\n            groups of jointly liable borrowers. 3) Information and\n            advisory services component will increase farmers access to\n            information, advice, and training. It will build capacity\n            for the provision of such services in the private and public\n            sectors, assemble useful technology and advice, and develop\n            suitable delivery mechanisms. 4) Rural policy unit will be\n            set up to assist the Government to develop a strategy to\n            maintain the competitiveness of agriculture in face of the\n            potential impact on the real exchange rate of developments\n            in the oil sector and related issues of agricultural sector management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan -
