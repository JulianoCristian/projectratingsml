Ratings for the\n            Andhra Pradesh Rural Poverty Reduction Project were as\n            follows: outcomes were highly satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory.

Reaching the\n            poorest of the poor can prove difficult through group\n            formation owing to rigid rules of attendance, set savings\n            contributions, joint liability, and other group\n            non-negotiable. Going forward, the strategy may need to be\n            altered towards household or individual support, or\n            differentiated models that consider the needs of the poorest\n            of the poor, prior to group formation. This multi-stage\n            approach is bound to incur additional costs. This implies\n            trade-offs between depth and coverage and between short-term\n            and long-term impact that should be accommodated in project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India -

The study on CBP\n            was carried out in 84 successful subprojects from three\n            community driven development (CDD) projects in India (in the\n            states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) and\n            local government units (Gram Panchayats1) in the state of\n            Kerala, to explore linkages both in terms of enablers and\n            outcomes.

was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: Factors such as strong\n            political commitment and continuity of project leadership\n            are essential for the success of a project. Promotion of\n            trust and group solidarity based on a common purpose is an\n            important element for building inclusive community\n            institutions. A poverty reduction project should focus more\n            on building the capacity of rural communities rather than\n            the capacity of the government. Capacity building should be\n            given very high priority. Implementation of sub projects\n            should start only after sufficient capacity building is\n            achieved. Any attempt to fast track without proper\n            foundation can result in manipulation and diluting project\n            objectives. The project confirms the lesson learned from\n            other livelihood programs across the region that promotion\n            of trust and group solidarity based on a common purpose is\n            an important initial element of building inclusive community\n            institutions. The project experience shows that social\n            mobilization and capacity building is process oriented, and\n            therefore, takes time to start-up but produce good results\n            when matured. It implies that project planning should\n            emphasize social mobilization as early in the project cycle\n            as possible."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Andhra Pradesh District

and environmentally\n            sustainable development, in six districts of Andhra Pradesh\n            Province, with an emphasis on poverty alleviation. However,\n            adverse effects on human health, and natural resources are\n            envisaged, and, sub-projects may have, negative\n            environmental impacts. Mitigation measures require that: 1)\n            air pollution levels be tested, on account of increased\n            vehicular traffic due to the construction of roads and\n            bridges; 2) bacterial contamination on surface, and ground\n            water be monitored, due to the construction of community\n            halls, schools, and education centers, as well as health\n            facilities. Furthermore, possible changes in regional water\n            levels may occur, with negative impacts on sanitation and\n            bio-diversity, thus test monitoring should be required; 3)\n            because of possible flooding, and soil erosion as a result\n            of construction works, soil fertility, fisheries production,\n            and water levels require environmental testing. Likewise,\n            crops improvement, will suffer reduced water levels in\n            streams, and water contamination, due to the use of\n            pesticides and chemicals, hence regular sampling, and\n            analysis of water quality, and levels should be conducted.

screening, and,\n            reviews the location, and classification of sub-projects,\n            under the Andhra Pradesh District Poverty Initiatives\n            Project, which aims at economic, and environmentally\n            sustainable development, in six districts of Andhra Pradesh\n            Province, with an emphasis on poverty alleviation. However,\n            adverse effects on human health, and natural resources are\n            envisaged, and, sub-projects may have, negative\n            environmental impacts. Mitigation measures require that: 1)\n            air pollution levels be tested, on account of increased\n            vehicular traffic due to the construction of roads and\n            bridges; 2) bacterial contamination on surface, and ground\n            water be monitored, due to the construction of community\n            halls, schools, and education centers, as well as health\n            facilities. Furthermore, possible changes in regional water\n            levels may occur, with negative impacts on sanitation and\n            bio-diversity, thus test monitoring should be required; 3)\n            because of possible flooding, and soil erosion as a result\n            of construction works, soil fertility, fisheries production,\n            and water levels require environmental testing. Likewise,\n            crops improvement, will suffer reduced water levels in\n            streams, and water contamination, due to the use of\n            pesticides and chemicals, hence regular sampling, and\n            analysis of water quality, and levels should be conducted.
