Some\n            lessons learned includes: improving harmonized frameworks.\n            Importance of announcement or credibility effects.\n            Announcement of the approval of an operation like EGPRC did\n            help in stabilizing exchange rate. It helped through (i) the\n            replenishment of foreign reserves and (ii) that the Bank and\n            International Monetary Fund (IMF) macro monitoring and\n            support to structural reform will help addressing some of\n            the causes of the rapid depreciation. Need for realistic\n            time framework and sequencing. While determining the prior\n            actions to be achieved, there is a need on the part of the\n            Bank and the Government to be realistic about the time\n            framework and the sequencing within which the deliverables\n            can be achieved. Trade-off between responsiveness to crisis\n            and quality at entry. The quality at entry is likely to\n            suffer in a situation such as the once faced by the Bank\n            during the preparation of the EGPRC, when it had to respond\n            to the macroeconomic crisis on an emergency basis.\n            Importance of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), think\n            tanks, trade unions and other organized structures. As the\n            Government by itself is unlikely to create an external\n            accountability mechanism, the Bank can play a major role for\n            creating and strengthening it by involving CSOs, think\n            tanks, trade unions and other organized structures."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ghana - Economic Governance and Poverty\n            Reduction Credit

stance to a sound and\n            sustainable track and protect the development objectives set\n            in Ghana's Second Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy\n            (GPRS II) for the

The GPRS II emphasizes\n            the centrality of private-led growth to reduce poverty,\n            along with human development and governance efforts to\n            promote equity. While EGPRC will translate primarily into\n            funding for the GPRS II implementation, particular attention\n            is given to: (i) restoring budgetary discipline; and (ii)\n            tackling long-standing public sector and energy issues. The\n            Development Policy Operation (DPO) is part of a program of\n            support to Ghana during FY09 that currently implies a 27\n            percent front-loading of International Development\n            Association (IDA) assistance.

Other operations being prepared for FY10\n            include an International Bank for Reconstruction and\n            Development (IBRD) enclave for the gas sector, a sector\n            development policy operation (agriculture), support for the\n            development of safety nets, a project in support of the\n            water and sanitation sectors, and a joint initiative with\n
