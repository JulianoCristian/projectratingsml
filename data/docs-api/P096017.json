Regional Sustainable Transport and\n            Air Quality Project development objectives will be: (1) to\n            establish a network of local and national government\n            stakeholders, international organizations and private sector\n            entities to promote policies and actions leading towards\n            more energy efficient and cleaner urban transport systems in\n            Latin American cities; (2) to assist cities to develop\n            sustainable urban transport strategies that integrate\n            climate change and air quality components; and (3) to\n            improve the capacity of cities to quantify the impacts of\n            transport policies on climate change and air pollution\n            emissions. The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013. The closing date\n            extension is necessary for two reasons. First, the country\n            projects had substantial effectiveness delays and started\n            about a year later than the regional project. Therefore, by\n            extending the closing date of the regional project by six\n            months, Clean Air Institute (CAI) will still be able to\n            provide the country projects with the necessary technical\n            assistance and help them to complete the evaluations of\n            their transport interventions. Secondly, the regional Global\n            Environmental Facility (GEF) project itself had an\n            effectiveness delay of six months. This shortened the\n            implementation period for CAI's activities not directly\n            aimed at supporting the country projects, in particular the\n            establishment of the network.

The closing date for the project will be extended\n            from December 31, 2012 until June 30, 2013. The closing date\n            extension is necessary for two reasons. First, the country\n            projects had substantial effectiveness delays and started\n            about a year later than the regional project. Therefore, by\n            extending the closing date of the regional project by six\n            months, Clean Air Institute (CAI) will still be able to\n            provide the country projects with the necessary technical\n            assistance and help them to complete the evaluations of\n            their transport interventions. Secondly, the regional Global\n            Environmental Facility (GEF) project itself had an\n            effectiveness delay of six months.
