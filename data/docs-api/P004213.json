Overall performance of the World Bank is\n            satisfactory, as is Borrower performance. The evaluation\n            provided these lessons: The two-year time frame was\n            inadequate. The time frame did not fully capture the\n            capabilities of the Department of Environment (DOE) and the\n            Fire and Rescue Service Department (FRD) to implement a\n            project of this nature. Further, both agencies were hampered\n            by the lack of knowledge and experience in Bank procedures.\n            This caused considerable delays in completing project\n            documentation including grant agreement and its subsequent\n            extensions, procurement, and special account management. in\n            the case of the MAC subproject, without a proper regulatory\n            framework and effective enforcement, the efforts to provide\n            financial incentives, training, and other assistance had\n            been found inadequate to induce investment in non-CFC\n            technologies. Similarly, the Halon subproject did not\n            proceed well under the management of the private operator\n            who lacked regulatory authority. The government quickly\n            learned this, and enacted separate legislation for\n            refrigeration and halon management. The public awareness\n            component helped to minimize resistance to the enactment of\n            Refrigeration Management Regulation. Without adequate\n            training and a financial subsidy, the service shops would\n            have difficulty financing and handling non-CFC technology,"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Malaysia - Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS)\n            Recycling Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Malaysia -
