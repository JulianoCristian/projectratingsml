Lessons are\n            derived from design, and implementation of the project. The\n            importance of ensuring firm commitments from all sources of\n            funding prior to signing, or effectiveness, is paramount for\n            a successful project completion; in this case, donor funds\n            were not secured, which led to a significant percentage of\n            the project not being implemented. Similarly, the Road Fund\n            was created, but the Government did not establish\n            institutional mechanisms for its operation: had collection\n            procedures been established, the Fund would have been able\n            to fully finance road maintenance. Suggestions indicate the\n            need to clearly define the necessary procedures prior to\n            credit negotiations, or effectiveness, and that Government\n            commitments back the acceptance of such procedures.\n            Moreover, given that procurement is a central issue in the\n            supervision of a project, the Bank team should remain close\n            to the client, and conduct at least one procurement audit\n            following the first year of execution, particularly in the\n            case of a newly created implementing agency, who may deviate\n            from agreed procurement guidelines. Finally, a general\n            recommendation stipulates the need for project restructuring\n            in post-conflict cases such as this one, with already two\n            project suspensions, followed by a war. By using an\n            emergency loan, restructuring could have focused on\n            emergency maintenance, rather than policy reforms, placing\n            the country in a position to seek follow-on sector funding,\n            and resume policy dialogues."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guinea-Bissau -
