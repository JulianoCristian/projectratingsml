The most important lesson learned from the\n            project is that profitable, efficient commercial operation\n            of energy enterprises in Georgia is difficult to achieve\n            under public management. The recovery of the sector requires\n            involvement of private strategic investors with sufficient\n            clout to resist the political pressure and vested interest,\n            and whose commercial interests are derived from a sustained\n            and efficient operation of the companies rather than\n            short-term political and commercial deals. Investment\n            projects have to be accompanied by institutional and policy\n            reforms needed to sustain project benefits. Actions on both\n            fronts are needed as they are mutually re-enforcing.\n            Coordination with other donors provided significant leverage\n            and synergies, both within the project and through the\n            associated Bank's operations. Ownership of the project,\n            as well as of the accompanying reforms, is critical. At the\n            project level, intensive technical assistance to the\n            implementing agency in procurement, financial management,\n            contract administration, and project management, and close\n            supervision of the project have been very important."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Power Rehabilitation Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Power

One of the project\n            components is the rehabilitation of a 300 MW (megawatt) unit\n            at the Gardabani Thermal Power Plant. This environmental\n            assessment took a preliminary examination of the influence\n            of operating Unit 10 on the environment. Calculations and\n            estimations to determine the pollution level of sulfuric\n            anhydride, nitrogen dioxide, and vanadium tetroxide\n            exhausted in atmosphere have been made, reference to the\n            percentage of the sulfur in the liquid fuel with the\n            variation from 1 to 4. It was clarified that in the case of\n            the unit operating using 4 percent mazout, total nitrogen\n            and sulfur concentration would be 0.3 possible limit rate.\n            Using 1, 2 and 3 percent mazout at Unit 10 will cause\n            serious pollution of the atmosphere. The study finds it\n            possible to implement the rehabilitation project of Unit 10."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Georgia - Power Rehabilitation Project :\n            environmental assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Georgia - Power Rehabilitation\n            Project : environmental assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1996/01/441656/georgia-power-rehabilitation-project-environmental-assessment","projn":"GE-Power Rehabilitation Project -- P035784","subtopic":"Energy and Environment,Transport and Environment,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Montreal Protocol","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Georgia","authors":{"authr":"Georgia"},"geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Commonwealth of Independent States!$!80457"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3980313101746"},"subsc":"Power,Oil and gas","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"admixture,air,air ratio,atmosphere,Average\n            speed,Co,combustion,consumption,emission,environmental\n            assessment,Environmental issues,FUEL,gas,gas,ISO,NATURAL\n            RESOURCES,nitrogen,nitrogen\n            dioxide,NO2,pe,PP,reference,SO2,speed,sulfur,sulphur,temperature,Thermal Power,vanadium,Waste"},"1":{"cdata!":"admixture,air,air ratio,atmosphere,Average\n            speed,Co,combustion,consumption,emission,environmental\n            assessment,Environmental issues,FUEL,gas,gas,ISO,NATURAL\n            RESOURCES,nitrogen,nitrogen\n            dioxide,NO2,pe,PP,reference,SO2,speed,sulfur,sulphur,temperature,Thermal Power,vanadium,Waste"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"1":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"2":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"},"3":{"geo_region":"Commonwealth of Independent States"}},"trustfund":"TF036514-GEORGIA - POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF036041-GEORGIA - POWER REHABILITATION,TF035958-GEORGIA - POWER PRIVATIZATION,TF033206-GEORGIA - POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT,TF032450-GEORGIA - POWER","repnb":"E213"},"facets":{}}}
