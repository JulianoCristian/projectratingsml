Furthermore, IDA was not\n            vigilant regarding conformity to the Bank's procurement\n            guidelines. The Implementation of the project would have\n            been improved by hiring a resident independent part-time\n            exploration advisor, who could have supervised the\n            consultant's selection, technical work, and invoicing,\n            by closer IDA supervision.
