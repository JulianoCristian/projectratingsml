Some lessons\n            learned included: the experience of parts of the human\n            resources sub-component of the PDPL confirms the importance\n            of 'ownership' and 'criticality' as good\n            practice principles for development policy loan operations.\n            The lack of clear ownership by the authorities and the\n            assessment that the prior action is not critical to\n            achieving results might have contributed to the partial\n            achievement of some of the program objectives and could be\n            interpreted as suggesting that a more narrow focus will have\n            been more appropriate. At the same time, the experience of\n            the decentralization sub-component of the program suggests\n            that a broader focus could be supported provided the good\n            practice principles are met. This subcomponent was not\n            necessarily central to either pillar one or two, but its\n            inclusion in the PDPL helped avert a potential derailing of\n            this area of reform. The PDPL team tried to secure a buy-in\n            for the supported reforms from as many groups, particularly\n            the opposition, as possible. This approach paid off as the\n            change in government between PDPL two and three did not\n            result in backtracking on the reform program. Also, the new\n            law on labor balanced the interests of the parties through\n            stakeholder involvement, which made its passage faster. The\n            participatory process by which the law was prepared also\n            improved negotiating sills of relevant stakeholders, which\n            will be useful for negotiations in the future."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -\n            First, Second, and Third Programmatic Development Policy\n            Loans

      Policy Loans (PDPLs) for Macedonia are to support the\n            Government's medium-term reform program aimed at\n            promoting growth and job creation through improvements in\n            the investment climate and strengthening the governance and\n            efficiency of the public sector. The reform program is\n            consistent with the Government's aspiration for\n            European Union (EU) integration and eventual EU membership.\n            The current capacity of some public sector institutions to\n            implement an ambitious reform agenda sustained over several\n            years remains relatively weak. However, the risk is\n            mitigated through the use of three donor financed grants\n            providing technical assistance in key areas of the reform\n            program and from Bank investment projects in the areas of\n            health, social protection, judiciary, and the business\n            environment. The risk is further mitigated through close\n            cooperation with other donors working in these reform areas.\n            The country also faces macroeconomic risks. Real Gross\n            Domestic Product (GDP) growth picked in 2007, but still\n            remains moderate compared with other countries in the region\n            and could be negatively affected by ongoing turmoil in\n            international financial markets and projected slowdown in\n            the EU. Inflation has begun rising, in part due to higher\n            prices for food and imported energy, and stronger expansion\n            in domestic demand. The current account deficit is projected\n            to widen measurably from one of the lowest levels in the\n            region. Mitigating factors include the possibility that\n            structural reforms, including those supported by the PDPL\n            series, will help stimulate growth in productivity and\n            exports and increase domestic saving. Further, ultimate\n            improvements in the political dialogue should speed EU\n            integration and, along with it, investor confidence. To the\n            extent that the improved investor confidence helps attract\n            larger inflows of foreign direct investment, even a larger\n            current account deficit could be financed without reliance\n            on foreign borrowing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Macedonia - Third Programmatic Development\n            Policy Loan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Macedonia -
