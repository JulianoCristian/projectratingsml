The Bali Urban\n            Infrastructure Project also had a moderately satisfactory\n            outcome but its institutional development impact is\n            substantial. The Municipal Innovations Project had a\n            satisfactory outcome with modest institutional development\n            impact. All three projects have unlikely sustainability. The\n            performances of the Bank and the Borrower for all three\n            projects were satisfactory.  Experience with the three\n            projects suggests the following lessons: 1) Local\n            governments should continue to build upon their demonstrated\n            capacity to improve infrastructure delivery, but need to be\n            more responsive to urban development needs expressed through\n            local community participation. 2) A cross-sector framework,\n            such as the Integrated Urban Infrastructure Development\n            Program (IUIDP), can work well for local governments,\n            provided the investment resources within it are sufficiently\n            concentrated to adequately address needs in all included\n            sectors. 3) All stakeholders, including local governments\n            themselves, need to agree and clearly understand the purpose\n            behind local innovations - be it to increase efficiency, to\n            increase client-responsiveness. 4) The Bank should ensure\n            that local governments are always included as partners, as\n            it continues to emphasize improving their performance in\n            service delivery. 5) Monitoring and Evaluation systems need\n            to be designed and implemented to track outcomes related to\n            project objectives, as well as the inputs and outputs of\n            project activities that will help achieve these outcomes."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia -

The Government of Indonesia and the\n            provincial government should try to identify the main\n            reasons for the generally disappointing project\n            implementation performance of Malang City, and draw\n            conclusions. Both levels of government and the Bank should\n            cooperate in defining a strategy for future financial\n            assistance to East Java, to fit with the Government of\n            Indonesia's and provincial priorities, and with the\n            Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The\n            Government and the Bank should try to identify a more\n            promising approach in the sanitation sector, because many\n            investments made under this project do not seem to show the\n            desired sustainability.
