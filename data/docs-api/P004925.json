Most enterprises did not perform as\n            envisaged. The Bank's identification, preparation and\n            appraisal of the IRDP was deficient. It should be noted that\n            the Bank underestimated the risks associated with the\n            project, as well as the degree of difficulty of PE\n            restructuring. The supervision of the project was deficient.\n            One annual supervision mission was not enough to allow\n            proper follow up or the opportunity to identify and solve\n            major problems. The Borrower's performance was\n            deficient and its commitment to the project and its\n            objectives was unsatisfactory. Key lessons learned include:\n            Borrower ownership must be sought throughout the project,\n            from conception to completion. (1) The lack of commitment of\n            the stakeholders to this project resulted in poor enterprise\n            performances; (2) micro-level restructuring without an\n            enabling macroeconomic framework is unlikely to be\n            successful; (3)ownership restructuring should be an\n            essential component of an industrial restructuring project;\n            (4) project objectives, as well as their implications, need\n            to be stated with clarity, (5) consistency and transparency\n            so that participating enterprises know precisely what is\n            required of them; (6) an efficient and close supervision as\n            well as dialogue should be maintained, on a continuous\n            basis, with the Borrowers; (7) project implementation units\n            must be familiarized with Bank guidelines so that an\n            efficient organizational structure is maintained during implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria - Industrial Restructuring\n            Demonstration Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Algeria - Industrial\n            Restructuring Demonstration Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1997/03/731992/algeria-industrial-restructuring-demonstration-project","projn":"DZ-Ind.
