The\n            lessons learned indicate that a close link between health\n            system improvements, policy and institutional reforms on one\n            hand, and achieving desired health outcomes on the other\n            hand, should be better reflected in project design and be\n            monitored accordingly. Regular policy dialogue to address\n            the problem of low public financing for the health sector is\n            extremely important. It is important to sharpen focus of the\n            public sector on service priorities in terms of both\n            resources and management. Facilitate development and more\n            engagement of private health sector in delivery of health\n            care to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is\n            necessary. The commitment of the government and the\n            political will for the support of the health project/sector\n            and the reforms played a vital role in the project's\n            achievements. Measuring and monitoring performance is\n            critical for management decisions and to ensure high impact\n            of project activities on the health sector. Development\n            objectives should be clearly defined and measurable. Another\n            lesson learnt is the need to have properly trained financial\n            management staff in place right from the beginning of the\n            project to ensure full financial accountability and adequate follow-up."},"docna":{"cdata!":"India - Second State Health Systems\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"India - Second State Health\n            Systems Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2004/09/5162876/india-second-state-health-systems-development-project","projn":"IN-State Health Sys II -- P035825","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems,Housing & Human Habitats,Health Economics & Finance,Health Systems Development & Reform","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"India","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20041006094839"},"subsc":"Health,Sub-national government administration","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services,Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to health services, Access to Primary\n            Health Care, basic health, basic health services, beds,\n            Child Health, communicable diseases, Community Health,\n            community hospitals, decision making, disease surveillance,\n            districts, doctors, expenditures, Financial Management,\n            health care, health care delivery, health care provision,\n            health care systems, health care waste, health centers,\n            health expenditure, health facilities, health outcomes,\n            health projects, health providers, health sector, health\n            services, Health system performance, HEALTH SYSTEMS,\n            hospital beds, hospitals, households, human development,\n            human resources, Infection, institutional capacity, Lessons\n            Learned, managers, medical supplies, medicines, nurses,\n            Nutrition, Occupancy, occupancy rates, paramedics,\n            partnership, Patient Satisfaction, patient satisfaction\n            surveys, patients, physicians, primary care, primary health\n            care, primary health care services, private sector, project\n            implementation, project preparation, public health, Public\n            health spending, public health system, public hospitals,\n            public sector, quality of health care, referral hospitals,\n            rural hospitals, sanitation, surgery, Waste"}},"owner":"S.A.
