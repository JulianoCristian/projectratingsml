Some lessons learned included:\n            in regards to project preparation, there is clear trade-offs\n            between a fast-track approach and a more time-consuming\n            approach based on in-depth country analysis. Even when there\n            is international experience to draw upon to address complex\n            development problems, every project requires an in-depth\n            analysis to ensure that project design is based on\n            sustainable approaches. Project designs that rely more on\n            existing models and less on a thorough understanding of\n            country needs and context may lead to risky projects with\n            delays in implementation.

high-risk groups; 2) improving\n            access for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) to care that\n            is effective, affordable, and equitable within the context\n            of government health policy; and c) strengthening their\n            institutional capacity to respond to HIV/AIDS in a\n            sustainable way.

The interventions chosen for each country project\n            will be based on the countries' epidemiological and\n            programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting\n            them, and include: 1) communication and advocacy to increase\n            government commitment, attention, and funding related to\n            HIV/AIDS and to raise awareness, knowledge, and\n            understanding among the general population about HIV/AIDS;\n            2) scaling up prevention activities at the national and\n            community levels; 3) scaling up care and support activities\n            at the national and community levels; 4) supporting research\n            and surveillance at the national level; and 5) capacity\n            building.
