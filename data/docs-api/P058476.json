Some\n            lessons learned included: the Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) should be integrated into the management structure of\n            the project rather than operate as a separate unit. In this\n            way its competence will be retained within the project and\n            not lost at the end of contract period. The Business Plan\n            for the company, drawn up by foreign consultants, proved to\n            be: too complicated for management. Establishment of such\n            long-term company strategies will make sense only for\n            already well-established entities and not for start-up\n            companies as Liepajas Ras Ltd (L-RAS). The same comment\n            applies to the technical assistance on the financial models\n            developed by a swedish consultant. European Union (EU)\n            accession and related harmonization of local legislation\n            with the EU acquis required additional efforts of\n            cooperation of all parties involved in project\n            implementation, monitoring and supervision to establish\n            univocal understanding of law changes which may impact on\n            achievement of project outputs. The language barrier was\n            often a problem in getting ideas across; the project should\n            have included an intensive english language course for key\n            members of management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Latvia -
