The project had two restructurings. The first\n            restructuring was in response to the mid-term review.\n            Overruns and shortfalls were identified and as a result were\n            cancelled and transferred to the Disaster Vulnerability\n            Reduction Project (DVRP). Two structures were dropped and\n            their funds were used to cover cost overruns on other parts\n            of the project. A second restructuring extended the project\n            closing date for another six months. The extension was\n            needed to accommodate the completion of a key infrastructure\n            facility for which after project effectiveness additional\n            hydraulic surveys were identified to be critical to conduct\n            prior to the investments; and to complete key geodetic and\n            flood and hydraulic surveys that were necessary to support\n            and inform proposed works under the DVRP that was under\n            preparation. There were several lessons learned from this\n            project including the following: (1) components designed to\n            meet immediate liquidity needs are critical parts of\n            post-disaster response, (2) climate resilient retrofitting\n            entails comprehensive interventions that should be accounted\n            for in initial designs, (3) projects, including emergency\n            projects like the Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Project\n            (HTERP), that finance major rehabilitation of\n            infrastructure, need to allow sufficient time for completion\n            of work; three years is generally too short a time period,\n            (4) initial estimates of rehab/retrofitting work costs need\n            to be made carefully/conservatively to avoid major\n            adjustments to the physical scope of the project down the\n            road, (5) maintenance planning and budget needs to be part\n            of rehabilitation work, (6) bank procurement procedures need\n            to take better into account the limitations of the small\n            island state context, and (7) preparation of rapid emergency\n            projects face constraints, such as undefined scope of\n            project activities and broad cost estimates due to lack of\n            readily available data and pre-engineering studies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Saint Lucia -
