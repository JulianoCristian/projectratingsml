Some lessons learned\n            included: emergency projects like this one need to be kept\n            simple, flexible and focused on solving the problem.\n            Therefore the Bank needs to ensure that procurement policies\n            can be used flexibly, and that decisions can be made\n            efficiently. This operation had some problems with timing.\n            The project was able to compensate for the time lost,\n            because of its focus on building long-term capacity for\n            surveillance and prevention. The monitoring and results\n            framework was succinct and appropriate for the emergency\n            operation and covered all development objectives. The\n            project design will have benefitted from including a\n            thorough economic analysis, as well as an impact analysis\n            with data on treatment, service utilization, and\n            effectiveness of the surveillance system. The results\n            framework reflects mostly outputs from project activities,\n            and quantitative data on the status and effectiveness of the\n            surveillance system was not routinely available for\n            inclusion in this report. This lesson should be taken into\n            account for the design of similar projects, where one of the\n            main goals is to build surveillance capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua -

The\n            grant will help finance the costs associated with the\n            Government's effort to monitor, control, and reduce the\n            number of fatalities and the risk of contraction of the\n            A/HlNl Human Influenza, which has resulted in 2,152\n            confirmed cases of the A/HlN1 Human Influenza registered as\n            of October 30, 2009, and eighteen deaths reported. Given\n            that epidemiologists expect a second wave of the influenza\n            to hit Central America beginning in the Fall, the Government\n            of Nicaragua (GoN) has requested Bank support in\n            strengthening its capacity to manage the spread of the virus\n            (and other influenza viruses as well). The project will\n            assist Nicaragua in improving its epidemiological\n            surveillance system and providing medicines to treat\n            infected individuals, with special
