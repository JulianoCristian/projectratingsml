The project includes:\n            (a) housing sites and services at Tung Song Hong for about\n            3,000 housing units, including land and infrastructure, core\n            houses with sanitary facilities, materials loans for house\n            completion through self-help, community facilities,\n            commercial and small-scale industrial areas and loans to\n            small-scale businesses; (b) slum improvement at five slums\n            affecting nearly 2,300 dwelling units, including land\n            acquisition, infrastructure improvements, community\n            facilities, loans to small-scale businesses and social\n            support programs; and (c) technical assistance to NHA,\n            including 66 man-months of consultancy and advisory\n            services, training/fellowships and project monitoring and\n            evaluation. The project inherently entails some risk, being\n            the first of its kind to be undertaken by NHA. The demand\n            for site and services units and the willingness of slum\n            residents to pay for improvements have yet to be proven in\n            Thailand, but the risks are considered reasonable in view of\n            the pilot nature of the project in dealing with shelter pro"},"docna":{"cdata!":"Thailand - Bangkok Sites and Services and\n            Slum Improvement Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Thailand - Bangkok Sites and\n            Services and Slum Improvement Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1978/03/727024/thailand-bangkok-sites-services-slum-improvement-project","projn":"TH-Bangkok Sites & Serv -- P004697","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Banks & Banking Reform,Municipal Financial Management,Urban Services to the Poor,Public Sector Economics","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","count":"Thailand","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101912294836"},"subsc":"(Historic)Urban housing","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Urban Development","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"assets,automobile use,borrowing,capital\n            grants,cities,commercial\n            banks,communities,deficits,Electricity,employment,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,Garbage\n            collection,Gross Domestic Product,Housing,income\n            distribution,inflation,interest on investment,land\n            tenure,land use,legislation,local\n            enterprises,migration,municipalities,neighborhood,pollution,private\n            sector,Public housing,Public sector,Public sector\n            employment,public transport,Roads,schools,sewage,slum\n            areas,Slum Improvement,Slum Upgrading,slums,solid waste\n            disposal,tax,taxation,technical assistance,traffic\n            congestion,traffic management,urban areas,urban\n            centers,urban management,urban poor,urban population,urban\n            poverty,Urban Projects,Urban Sector,urban\n            services,urbanization,wage rates,waste,water meters,water supply"},"1":{"cdata!":"assets,automobile use,borrowing,capital\n            grants,cities,commercial\n            banks,communities,deficits,Electricity,employment,financial\n            management,FISCAL YEAR,foreign exchange,Garbage\n            collection,Gross Domestic Product,Housing,income\n            distribution,inflation,interest on investment,land\n            tenure,land use,legislation,local\n            enterprises,migration,municipalities,neighborhood,pollution,private\n            sector,Public housing,Public sector,Public sector\n            employment,public transport,Roads,schools,sewage,slum\n            areas,Slum Improvement,Slum Upgrading,slums,solid waste\n            disposal,tax,taxation,technical assistance,traffic\n            congestion,traffic management,urban areas,urban\n            centers,urban management,urban poor,urban population,urban\n            poverty,Urban Projects,Urban Sector,urban\n            services,urbanization,wage rates,waste,water meters,water supply"}},"owner":"Southeast Asia Headquarters Unit (EACSQ)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"repnb":"1776"},"facets":{}}}
