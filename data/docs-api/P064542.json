The Slovak authorities remained strongly\n            committed to the banking and enterprise sector reforms\n            throughout the EFSAL implementation period.  Lessons learned\n            included: A) The loan was appropriately designed in\n            conjunction with the IMF SMP and as a multi-tranche\n            operation with a sufficiently long implementation period, in\n            line with the complexity and broad span of activities\n            envisaged under the operation. B) A key success factor was\n            Commitment to Reform by both the Slovak authorities and the\n            Bank. C) The project coherence with the Bank's Slovakia\n            AAA Program helped to define the pace and direction of the\n            reforms. In addition, these Bank activities deepened the\n            understanding and buy-in of the reforms needed, and helped\n            build institutional capacity to implement laws and\n            regulations. D) The project demonstrated that a challenging\n            and complex multi-sector adjustment loan can be successfully\n            implemented in a very short time period under the right\n            circumstances. Drawing on the lessons learned from the\n            EFSAL, the Bank could implement similar adjustment\n            operations/programs in other countries facing similar

        Adjustment Loan, in accordance with the Government's\n            enterprise and financial sector reform program, comprised\n            four components: a) restructuring and privatization of the\n            banking system, but also including resolution of all\n            troubled medium-sized banks; b) substantial strengthening of\n            banking regulation and supervision; c) implementation of a\n            strategy to resolve the large stock of problem loans taken\n            off the books of the state banks; and, d) improving the\n            legal framework, centered on the bankruptcy and collateral\n            regime, and laws dealing with corporate governance. While\n            rapid progress was made with implementation of the first two\n            components, selected reforms supporting implementation of\n            the last two components however, were noticeably slower to\n            materialize. Therefore, release of the second tranche\n            slipped from its original target date of early 2002, to well\n            into 2003. Nonetheless, the pace of reform implementation\n            accelerated noticeably during late 2002 and early 2003, also\n            due to Slovakia's pending EU accession in May 2004,\n            and, developments so far in 2003, and prospects for next\n            year are encouraging. However, important risks remain: on\n            the fiscal side, legislative changes relating to the\n            spending reforms still need Parliament approval, and,\n            outside the state budget, better control over municipalities\n            and the health sector is needed, to avoid further slippages.\n            Monetary policy continues to face a difficult balance\n            between reducing inflation, and containing speculative\n            capital inflows. Notwithstanding, progress against the\n            second tranche release, and its conditions specified in the\n            Loan Agreement have been met. In view of the overall\n            performance, and progress with the implementation of the\n            Program supported by the Loan, and in compliance with the\n            specific conditions of

           Government's comprehensive program of bank, and\n            enterprise reforms. The program contains four broad\n            components: 1) restructuring, and privatization of the\n            banking system, centered on the privatization of the three\n            large State banks, but including too, the resolution of all\n            troubled medium banks; 2) substantial strengthening of\n            banking regulation, and supervision; 3) full implementation\n            of a strategy to workout the large stock of classified\n            claims; and, 4) substantial improvements in the legal\n            framework, centered on the bankruptcy, and collateral\n            regimes, and, the laws dealing with corporate governance.\n            Reform actions, sought under the project, will improve the\n            stability, and efficiency of the banking system; promote\n            enterprise restructuring; and, attract foreign investment,\n            to ultimately contribute to employment, and output growth in\n            the longer-run. Nonetheless, there are risks involved to the\n            project, mostly due to the political situation: the broad\n            coalition could interrupt implementation of some project\n            components, if faced with adverse short-run effects of the\n            reforms, such as unemployment, or a very low price for the\n            bad assets. However, this risk seems to be modest, given the\n            advanced implementation stage of reforms."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovak Republic - Enterprise and Financial\n            Sector Adjustment
