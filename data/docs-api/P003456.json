On the basis that the major physical\n            (development) objective is considered reachable and\n            sustainable, that satisfactory sector policy and\n            institutional objectives have been met, and that financial\n            and economic benefits are likely to be positive and\n            acceptable, the project outcome is rated as satisfactory.\n            There are three key lessons to be learned from the project\n            implementation experience. First, it is essential to ensure\n            that all components that are important to the project are\n            integrated and proceed simultaneously. Second, no matter how\n            much care is exercised during project preparation and\n            appraisal, implementation issues will arise and the Bank can\n            provide greater assistance in resolving these issues by\n            assigning the necessary supervision resources.
