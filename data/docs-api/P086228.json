Some lessons\n            learned includes: the program was initiated less than two\n            years after the Bonn agreement. The needs for capacity\n            building were poorly defined at the time.\n            Ministries/agencies/departments were understaffed,\n            under-budgeted with unclear mandates. Two elements of this\n            innovation stand out. First, contingent changes to civil\n            service regulations opened up the civil service to external\n            recruitment. Second, incentive pay for Lateral entry\n            Programs (LEPs) in line posts was introduced without adding\n            upward pressure on the overall civil service pay structure\n            as they were essentially civil servants 'on\n            contract'. Both these lessons are relevant for post\n            conflict institutional environments characterized by\n            collapsed administrations and severe fiscal constraints.\n            Afghan Expatriate Programs (AEPs) often worked close to\n            Ministers and professionalized offices of the Ministers\n            enabling them to better focus on decision making and\n            separate their ministerial functions from their\n            'political roles'."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Afghanistan - Civil Service Capacity\n            Building Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Afghanistan - Civil Service\n            Capacity Building Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2011/05/18319995/afghanistan-civil-service-capacity-building-project","projn":"AF-Artf-Civil Service Capacity Building -- P086228","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Access to Finance,Public Sector Corruption &\n            Anticorruption Measures,E-Business,Banks & Banking Reform,Government Diagnostic Capacity Building","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Private Sector Development","count":"Afghanistan","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"South Asia!$!80470"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20130930122735"},"theme":"Macroeconomic management","subsc":"Central government administration,General public administration sector","admreg":"South Asia,South Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Public Sector Development,Private Sector Development","prdln":"Recipient Executed Activities","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"accountability, administrative cost,\n            Administrative Reform, advertising, Anti-Corruption,\n            Appointee, appointees, Bank contracts, Bank financing, Bank\n            Ratings, Borrower, Businessman, CAPACITY BUILDING,\n            capacity-building, CDS, civil servants, CIVIL SERVICE, civil\n            service reform, complaint, computers, conflict of interest,\n            Consulting Service, consulting services, coordination\n            mechanisms, corruption, country of origin, credits,\n            Criminal, cronyism, cultural barriers, day-to-day\n            management, decision making, deficits, discretion, document\n            management, electronic filing, employee, employer,\n            Employment, entry point, equipment, Exchange Rate,\n            Expatriate, Expatriates, Finance Company, finances,\n            financial administration, Financial Management, financial\n            risks, financial transactions, Gender, Gender Aspects,\n            gender mainstreaming, gender policy, General public,\n            Government entities, human capacity, human resource, human\n            resource development, ICT, ID, Implementing Agencies,\n            implementing agency, Information Culture, Information\n            System, infrastructure development, innovation, institution,\n            institutional capacity, institutional reform, institutional\n            reforms, Internal Audit, international consultant, IP,\n            Justice, labor market, labor markets, laws, leadership,\n            legal framework, legal reform, legislative reform, Local\n            Governance, Local Government, Management Reports, mandates,\n            material, Media, Migration, minister, Ministers, ministries\n            of finance, Monitoring Mechanism, monitoring mechanisms,\n            newsletter, outreach, patronage, peer review, performance\n            appraisal, Performance Indicators, physical infrastructure,\n            private sector, privatization, procurement, procurement\n            process, procurements, project management, Protocol, Public\n            Administration, public investment, rates of return,\n            recurrent expenditures, reform process, Refugees, result,\n            RESULTS, service delivery, set of standards, Social\n            Development, Source of Funds, Supervision, targets,\n            Technical Assistance, technical experts, Telecom,\n            transaction, transparency, Transport, trust funds, wage\n            differential, woman"}},"owner":"Governance & Public Sector (SASGP)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"South Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"South Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF053940-ARTF-AFGHANISTAN CIVIL SERVICES\n            CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT","majtheme":"Economic management","repnb":"ICR1549"},"facets":{}}}
