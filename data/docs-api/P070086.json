Lessons learned from the project: Trade\n            facilitation is always a multi-sectoral and multi-agency\n            activity. The replication and scaling up of lessons learned\n            in trade facilitation to other sites must always be reset\n            within the specific context of the site where the\n            application is to take place as well as taking into account\n            relevant national systems impacting on trade. Customs\n            control will become more effective and efficient under\n            selective procedure. The long lines of vehicles waiting to\n            be processed at border crossing points are symptomatic of\n            the need for trade facilitation. High Level Support.\n            Building a tradition of inter-agency communication and\n            information sharing as well as building the mechanisms on\n            which such communication can be based, needs a high-level\n            government commitment and ideally a leading person. While\n            coordination issues are typically downplayed among border\n            agencies, monitoring provides a sound and fair basis to\n            demonstrate issues, establish a baseline, make and\n            acknowledge progress, and provide an incentive to improve\n            processing. The Public-Private dialogue initiated under the\n            project led to significant development. A central task in\n            the reform process is the formation of a new work culture.\n            Not all aspects of trade facilitation are equally essential.\n            Preparation time for all civil works can be very long in\n            Bulgaria, following very thorough process of coordination\n            among the relevant stakeholders."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Trade and Transport Facilitation\n            in Southeast Europe Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2006/03/6704646/bulgaria-trade-transport-facilitation-southeast-europe-project","projn":"BG-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            South East Europe -- P070086","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Trade Policy,Transport Economics Policy & Planning,Customs and Trade,Transport and Trade Logistics,Common Carriers Industry","teratopic":"International Economics and Trade,Transport,Industry","count":"Bulgaria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000090341_20060404083212"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"International Economics and Trade,Transport,Industry","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"benefits of trade, Border Crossing, border\n            crossings, Bosnia Herzegovina, containers, contraband,\n            Customs, customs activities, Customs Administration, customs\n            administrations, Customs Authorities, customs clearance,\n            Customs Code, Customs cooperation, Customs cooperation\n            agreements, Customs Debt, Customs Declaration, Customs\n            declarations, Customs documents, Customs Information,\n            Customs inspection, Customs legislation, Customs office,\n            Customs offices, Customs officials, customs procedures,\n            customs reform, Customs regimes, Customs revenue, East\n            Europe, exports, financing of infrastructure, flow of\n            traffic, foreign investors, Foreign Trade, Forwarding, free\n            trade, freight, Freight Forwarders, imports, inspection,\n            inspection facilities, international Customs conventions,\n            international transport, lanes, Ministry of Transport,\n            passengers, Police, property rights, Quality Assurance,\n            Road, Road Transport, road vehicles, seaports, Supply Chain\n            Management, tariff rates, Tax, Tax policy, terminal fees,\n            Tourism, trade agreements, trade barriers, Trade Center,\n            Trade Facilitation, trade facilitation audits, traffic,\n            Transit, transit operations, Transit System, transparency,\n            TRANSPORT, transport contracts, transport costs, TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION, transport operators, transport sector, Trucks,\n            types of transit, vehicle"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF030454-AUSTRIA GENERAL CTF FY04 - ECA,TF030461-GREECE CTF FY04 - BALKANS,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.

The\n            major concerns about possible negative site specific impacts\n            associated with border crossings relate to 1) emissions from\n            vehicles waiting for custom clearances; 2) drainage of\n            disinfectants and spills of oils and fuel; 3) waste disposal\n            and loose garbage; and 4) site disruptions caused by\n            upgrades or relocations of utilities or such infrastructure\n            as buildings, parking/waiting areas, and access roads.\n            Specific actions to minimize any potentially negative impact\n            and promote institutional development include liaising with\n            environmental authorities and reviewing and monitoring EMP\n            compliance; staff training and sensitization at each border\n            crossing; certifying acceptable practices and impact\n            minimization, especially storing and properly using\n            disinfecting materials and chemicals, and hazardous\n            materials and garbage; harmonizing regulatory requirements\n            with European Union and international standards; and\n            incorporating environmental plans in consultant contracts\n            and project design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bulgaria - Trade and Transport Facilitation\n            in Southeast Europe : environmental management plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bulgaria - Trade and Transport\n            Facilitation in Southeast Europe : environmental management plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/02/438123/bulgaria-trade-transport-facilitation-southeast-europe-environmental-management-plan","projn":"BG-Trade & Transport Facilitation In\n            South East Europe -- P070086","docty":"Environmental Assessment","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Energy and Environment,Environmental Governance,Sanitation and Sewerage,Environmental Management","teratopic":"Energy","count":"Bulgaria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Europe!$!80461"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_00031505333431"},"subsc":"Central government administration","admreg":"Europe and Central Asia,Europe and Central Asia","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Energy","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"access to\n            information,disinfectants,drainage,emissions,EMP,Endangered\n            Species,Environmental Authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental management plan,environmental\n            officer,environmental regulations,environmental\n            report,environmental\n            reports,fauna,flora,fuel,garbage,hazardous\n            materials,Hazardous Wastes,international\n            conventions,litter,potential threat,utilities,vehicle\n            emissions,waste,waste disposal"},"1":{"cdata!":"access to\n            information,disinfectants,drainage,emissions,EMP,Endangered\n            Species,Environmental Authorities,environmental\n            compliance,environmental impact,environmental\n            impacts,environmental issues,environmental\n            management,environmental management plan,environmental\n            officer,environmental regulations,environmental\n            report,environmental\n            reports,fauna,flora,fuel,garbage,hazardous\n            materials,Hazardous Wastes,international\n            conventions,litter,potential threat,utilities,vehicle\n            emissions,waste,waste disposal"}},"owner":"Infrastructure & Energy Srvc Dpt (ECSIE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"1":{"geo_region":"Europe"},"2":{"geo_region":"Europe"}},"trustfund":"TF038544-ALBANIA:  TRADE &\n            TRANSPORTATION FACILITATION,TF024042-BNPP-TRADE: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE,TF040163-ALBANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - PROCURM,TF040162-ABLANIA: TRADE AND TRANSPORT\n            FACILITATION IN SE EUROPE - PROJECT LAUNCH,TF039898-ROMANIA-TRANSPORT AND TRADE\n            FACILITIES IN SE EUROPE,TF037984-ECA REGION - TRADE AND TRANS.
