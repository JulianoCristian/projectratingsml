Some lessons learned included:\n            Strong, top-down state commitment and action is critical to\n            the success of decentralization and this \u0093block grants plus\n            capacity building\u0094 approach.

It is critical that the\n            M&E and management information system of\n            decentralization projects are more robust and well thought\n            through, even if this is challenging for this type of\n            project.

It is important\n            to ensure that the GP plans and their implementation\n            sufficiently reflect changing constituent preferences and\n            the interests of the more excluded groups.
