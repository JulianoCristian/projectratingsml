Some of\n            the main lessons from these projects suggest that: The\n            ethnic divide, distrust, and governance problems, are the\n            key constraints to improving the environment for private\n            sector development (PSD), and fostering sustainable growth\n            in Guyana. At the project level, all future Bank operations,\n            including their components and processes (e.g. consultations\n            on project design, hiring of consultants, procurement,\n            selection of trainees, choice of regulatory options, etc.),\n            should address the way to at least, avoid deepening\n            distrust, and if possible, serve to build trust across the\n            racial divide. Transparency should be the key watchword for\n            both the Government, and donors. In addition, more\n            diagnostic work on incentives, institutions, and social\n            capital is needed, with a view to identifying strategies,\n            and tactics for rationalizing incentives, building\n            sustainable institutions, and fostering social capital.\n            Understanding the political economy is essential to project\n            choice, and design."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana -

Lessons suggest the following. The Bank\n            should consider including in its legal covenants, provisions\n            which would avoid delaying project components if the\n            government chooses to substitute certain project activities\n            with grant funds, which had not yet been approved, nor\n            received. Therefore, the lack of grant money will not be a\n            factor delaying the execution of important project\n            components. In a small developing country striving to emerge\n            from poverty, with very limited capacity, it is unrealistic\n            to expect transformation of the financial sector into\n            institutional framework models that enable private sector\n            investment, all in a relatively short timeframe; rather, a\n            longer time-frame should be expected. Further lessons\n            address the need to design privatization programs in a\n            socially sensitive manner, e.g., by including in enterprise\n            sale contracts, clauses to protect workers and minority\n            investors; a technical assistance operation can be effective\n            and quickly disbursed if a previous lending operation, or\n            set of actions had already laid the ground for its prompt\n            implementation; and, project ownership and commitment is\n            critical to project success, in this case the task team\n            worked to ensure a consistent level of involvement of the\n            Government in project supervision, and monitoring."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Guyana - Financial and Private Sector\n

The component will provide funds for technical\n            assistance, training, and equipment, in support of the\n            privatization process. Additionally, a framework for\n            facilitating public offering of shares, of those privatized\n            enterprises, will be developed, and, socially equitable\n            policies, will ensure sound safeguards' protection; 3)\n            development of public business services, to establish a\n            national contractors registry.
