The physical\n            objectives of the project were substantially achieved. A new\n            25 MW diesel plant was added to the system; transmission\n            lines, substations and a modern load dispatch center were\n            constructed; and distribution systems were expanded.\n            However, the project was completed 28 months behind schedule\n            with a cost overrun of 25 percent. The delay in the\n            installation of the power plant resulted in power shortages\n            in the period 1975-76. Although the rate of return for the\n            power plant is negative, Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y\n            Electrificacion (IRHE) overall investment program continued\n            having a high rate of return comparable to appraisal\n            estimates. Although energy sales grew much slower than\n            expected, the timing of the project was not premature, as\n            the new power plant has been used to meet peak demand in\n            normal hydrological years and to replace hydro-energy during\n            dry periods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Panama - Third Power Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Panama - Third Power Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1982/12/1560331/panama-third-power-project","projn":"PA-Power Iii-270921 -- P007800","docty":"Project Completion Report","subtopic":"Environmental Economics & Policies,Business Environment,Roads & Highways,Business in Development,Economic Adjustment and Lending","teratopic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","count":"Panama","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000178830_98101901011517"},"subsc":"(Historic)Distribution and transmission","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Private Sector Development,Transport,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth,Environment","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Electric Power & Other Energy","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,acquisition,Bank\n            Lending,borrower,Borrowings,Cement,commitment,concessions,concrete,Contractors,corrosion,Cost\n            Analysis,cost\n            overruns,debt,Disbursement,Disbursements,economic\n            growth,engine,engines,Exchange Rate,Expenditures,Financial\n            Statements,financing plans,framework,fuel,Guarantee\n            Agreements,Inflation,Inflation Rates,Internal Rate of\n            Return,Investment Expenditures,LOAN,loan disbursements,local contractors,oil,Procurement,Sales,signs,speed,suppliers"},"1":{"cdata!":"account,accounting,acquisition,Bank\n            Lending,borrower,Borrowings,Cement,commitment,concessions,concrete,Contractors,corrosion,Cost\n            Analysis,cost\n            overruns,debt,Disbursement,Disbursements,economic\n            growth,engine,engines,Exchange Rate,Expenditures,Financial\n            Statements,financing plans,framework,fuel,Guarantee\n            Agreements,Inflation,Inflation Rates,Internal Rate of\n            Return,Investment Expenditures,LOAN,loan disbursements,local contractors,oil,Procurement,Sales,signs,speed,suppliers"}},"owner":"Central America Countries CMU (LCC2C)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"repnb":"4246"},"726752":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1973/11/726752/panama-third-power-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/1973/11/726752/panama-third-power-project","new_url":"1973/11/726752/panama-third-power-project","disclosure_date":"2010-06-18T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/09/30/000178830_98101912415714/Rendered/INDEX/multi_page.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2000/09/30/000178830_98101912415714/Rendered/PDF/multi_page.pdf","loan_no":"0948","datestored":"2000-09-30T00:00:00Z","docdt":"1973-11-30T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Panama - Third Power Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The Third IBRD Power Project will help\n            to interconnect the regional systems and also help meet the\n            regular increase of Panama's power needs.
