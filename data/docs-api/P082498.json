Some lessons learned included: building\n            working relationships based on trust and confidence of local\n            authorities at governorate and district levels is essential\n            to the decentralization process and to SFD's (Social\n            Fund for Development Agency) efforts to promote effective\n            civic participation in local development. Clear\n            communication of the distinct roles and functions of local\n            government and civil society and the way in which they are\n            brought together in a participatory process is essential to\n            bring about recognition and legitimacy of the bottom-up\n            approach of development process. Contributions, however,\n            should not impose a heavy burden on communities, especially\n            low-income households. During the last year of\n            implementation of the third phase, SDF adopted a unified\n            approach which limits community contribution to 5 percent\n            and exempts poor people who are not able to pay. This new\n            approach is expected to be fully implemented during the\n            fourth phase. Building the capacity of government apparatus\n            and of communities to play a responsible role and demand\n            accountability from government are key elements to building\n            governance structures at decentralized and community levels.\n            SFD's capacity building interventions and proven\n            instruments that provide for a demand-driven approach,\n            pro-poor allocation of resources, use of verified data for\n            decision-making, participatory approaches, and transparency\n            at all levels, help promote solid systems of governance that\n            underscore State Building. Implementation of innovative\n            pilots can help refine methodologies, provide incentives for\n            stakeholders to become active partners in the pilot, and\n            provide lessons for scaling up activities. SFD pilots to\n            promote rural girls' education, inclusive education for\n            groups with special needs, and integrated intervention\n            programs all contribute to broader education sector goals\n            and priorities for improving equitable access to education.\n            Similarly, SFD's pilot of the public workfare program\n            has helped to provide a safety net to mitigate the effects\n            of food price increases on poor households, while at the\n            same time enabling the creation of physical infrastructure\n            investments that become community assets."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Third Social Fund for Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Third Social Fund for\n

additional financing to the Yemen\n            Third Social Fund for Development Project (SFD III) is to\n            help Yemen respond to the global food crisis which is having\n            a significant impact on the Yemeni population. Yemen needs\n            the Bank's support to cope with the crisis because of\n            the limited potential for supply response, the impact of\n            food prices on poverty, and the increasing risk of food\n            riots. Yemen's limited endowment of water and\n            cultivable land diminishes agricultural supply response to\n            higher food grain prices. In this context, the Government\n            has requested Bank support in a letter dated May 18, 2008.\n            In response to the Government's request, additional\n            financing will support a workfare program implemented by SFD\n            that will channel cash into the hands of the poor to help\n            them cope with the food price emergency. In parallel, a\n            small component of the additional financing will support the\n            improvement of a sustainable cash-based safety net that\n            would further mitigate risks, including the adverse impacts\n            of high and more volatile food prices on poverty. The\n            financing from the Global Food Crisis Response Program\n            (GFCRP) Trust Fund facility will provide immediate support\n            to two sets of complementary activities to be undertaken as\n            additional financing to the current Third Social Fund for\n            Development Project: (i) community-based labor intensive\n            works through a well-tested mechanism, the highly-successful\n            SFD, which will finance activities in some of the poorest\n            parts of the country; and (ii) support to the Social Welfare\n            Fund (SWF) to carry out a national survey to identify the\n            poorest Yemenis suffering from high food and fuel prices in\n            order to improve targeting and expand the program, and to\n            complete a revised targeting system that will increase the\n            share of cash transfers received by the poorest\n            beneficiaries, improving the ability of the program to\n            reduce poverty immediately. The support to SWF will\n            complement the technical assistance being provided by the\n            European commission. The project will build on the success\n            of the ongoing third phase of the SFD operation, and will\n            continue to support the SFD's delivery of social\n            services using participatory approaches. Overall, SFD\n            project progress is satisfactory, and provides an excellent\n            opportunity to successfully implement the additional funds."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Republic of Yemen -
