Some lessons learned included:\n            following the restoration of independence in Timor-Leste,\n            donors flooded into this new country with high hopes of\n            getting the institutions right the first time around. Faced\n            with serious deficiencies in even the most basic areas of\n            government, development partners helped establish a\n            comprehensive set of institutions and processes for\n            planning, budgeting, spending, control, monitoring, and\n            oversight. The Government itself placed a high priority on\n            establishing the constitutionally mandated institutions of\n            their newly sovereign nation. Indeed, progress was\n            impressive during the first five years. Sophisticated\n            institutions were being established, and a comprehensive\n            planning and budgeting system was being put in place.\n            However, capacity constraints, tight internal control, and\n            slow budget execution have prevented these systems from\n            reaching their full potential. Though institutions were\n            importantly maintained during the 2006 crisis, it has become\n            clear that they remain fragile. The priority placed by\n            Government and donors on establishing best practice systems\n            may have come at the expense of good enough basic processes\n            suited to a new Government with low administrative capacity."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Timor-Leste - Consolidation Support Program Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Timor-Leste - Consolidation\n
