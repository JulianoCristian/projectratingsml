Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Mid-Yangtze Agricultural Development\n            Project in China. Project objectives were to increase the\n            amount, productivity and marketability of fruit production\n            in low income areas of Sichuan, Hubei and Chongqing and thus\n            increase incomes and alleviate poverty. The project has\n            achieved its objectives of introducing new technologies in\n            the development of wasteland along the Yangtze River into\n            high-quality orchards. The project's overall outcome is\n            considered highly satisfactory. It achieved its objectives\n            and did it with a high degree of sustainability. The key\n            lessons learned from the project include the following: (a)\n            Strong research and scientific bases drawn from domestic and\n            international experience and the involvement of a science\n            and technical committee have been essential to the success\n            of this project. (b) Active roles of Ministry of\n            Agriculture, provincial and local governments and research\n            institutes in carrying out central government policy and\n            cooperation among them contributed to the smooth\n            implementation and success of the Project. (c) Staff in the\n            implementation agencies should be drawn from technical\n            bureaus familiar with the technical details of the\n            operation. (d) Participation of farmers with a sense of\n            ownership from the beginning made a big difference in how\n            the project was implemented. (e) Adequate and timely\n            allocation of counterpart funds according to schedule is a\n            prerequisite for smooth project implementation. Finally, (f)\n            more supervision missions should have been budgeted,\n            particularly with the object of assisting the Provincial\n            Project Management Offices with procurement and disbursement\n            problems, and earlier TA for marketing is needed to start\n            marketing off on a strong footing."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China -
