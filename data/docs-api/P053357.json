The main lessons from these credits are: 1)\n            Small, focused, one-tranche policy projects with realistic\n            objectives, supported by technical assistance, may work well\n            in transition countries that are politically unstable and\n            have low market economy skills. A limited reform agenda is\n            easier to implement, especially if parliamentary approval is\n            needed for new laws when the political landscape is not\n            stable. Reform continuity can be maintained by similar\n            policy or investment follow-on projects. 2) The very quick\n            preparation and disbursement o f PESC was effective in\n            providing development assistance and coordinating\n            substantial humanitarian assistance. 3) Disbursement against\n            a negative list of imports expedited resource transfer,\n            which was appropriate in Albania's circumstances. 4)\n            Aid coordination--including the appropriate alignment o f\n            government agencies--is critical to ensure appropriate,\n            harmonized and effective assistance where many donors are\n            involved. 5) Some organizations established for special\n            purposes under IDA projects could be transformed into\n            private sector commercial entities when their mandate is\n            complete. This transition could be an integral part o f that\n            organization's strategy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit, Recovery\n            Program Technical Assistance

- Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The project outcome was satisfactory.\n            Key lessons learned are: 1) Since the government was not\n            legally bound to adopt the follow-up measures of the\n            project, some of them were not accomplished. This can be\n            attributed to the fact that a) they were not specific enough\n            to monitor the follow-up measures of the project; and b)\n            greater priority was given to resolving the problems caused\n            by the pyramid schemes and in reforming the banking sector\n            than to social sector, which explains why regarding the\n            social safety net and employment promotion, follow-up\n            measures were partially achieved and at a slow pace. 2)\n            Sectoral policy reforms, like those in Employment Promotion,\n            and to a lesser extent in the banking sector, can be slowed\n            down by institutional issues and changes in government. Many\n            of these reforms involve the approval of laws by Parliament,\n            and this process can be significantly hampered by internal\n            political pressures and weak governance, as in Albania. 3)\n            Timeliness was important for the success of the project.\n            Given the crisis situation in Albania at the time of\n            preparation at the economic, political, and social levels,\n            the close collaboration between the Bank and the government\n            provided the needed balance of payments support and a basis\n            for continuing dialogue and fruitful cooperation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit

Albania s economic recovery program. These\n            measures aim to address some of the key structural\n            weaknesses which have contributed to the recent crisis, and\n            to alleviate the increased poverty and unemployment\n            generated by the crisis. Specifically, the credit supports\n            (1) the winding down of the pyramid schemes by appointing\n            external administrators to control these companies operating\n            the schemes, and to manage the recovery and distribution of\n            their assets to depositors; (2) reforms in the banking\n            sector including enhancing private sector participation in\n            the three commercial and savings banks, as well as\n            strengthening the legal and judicial framework, the\n            financial infrastructure, and banking supervision; (3)\n            increased budgetary outlays for social assistance through\n            block grants to local authorities, especially to benefit the\n            elderly and orphans, and increasing the involvement of\n            nongovernmental organizations; and (4) employment promotion\n            through community work programs, adjusting social insurance\n            legislation, and implementing a new financing and accounting\n            system for the unemployment insurance program. The Credit is\n            closely coordinated with the conditions of structural reform\n            in the financial sector approved under the IMF's\n            post-conflict Emergency Assistance Program, which underpins\n            the macroeconomic framework. The Credit will be released in\n            a single tranche."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Albania - Rehabilitation Credit
