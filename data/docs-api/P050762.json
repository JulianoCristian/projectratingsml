The outcomes of the Innovations in Basic\n            Education and Northeast Basic Education (NEBE) projects are\n            rated moderately satisfactory. The projects exceeded or\n            surpassed most targets for physical inputs and training but\n            it is not clear that the learning goals were met. The\n            objectives of the two NEBE projects were focused towards\n            central management improvements, and these had little or no\n            impact on quality improvement. Due to design shortcomings,\n            Bank performance for the FUNDESCOLA project, which was\n            designed to target schools, was satisfactory. Borrower\n            performance is rated satisfactory for all but the\n            Innovations in Education project. A number of OED lessons\n            are confirmed with these projects: 1) Attention should be\n            paid to state, municipal, or even school management, and\n            moreover, to classromm time. States and municipalities that\n            are better off are more likely to take advantage of\n            Bank-financed resources. The challenge is to emcourage the\n            poorer ones to benefit as well. Decentralizing school\n            managmeent is not a panacea: autonomy permits the poorest or\n            least knowledgeable municipalities to fall behind, without\n            much possibility for helping the residents. Classroom\n            observations may be used as predictors of achievement: they\n            can potentially provide feedback and promote improvements\n            sooner than achievement tests. Students' health needs\n            and problems must be addressed to optimize cognitive\n            development and classroom learning."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - Innovations in Basic Education\n

Lessons emphasize that\n            working with state, and municipal governments (as these were\n            directly responsible of the delivery of basic education), a\n            recognition taken into account early on during project\n            design, and implementation, ensured the political support,\n            and demonstrated the efficacy of grassroots policies.\n            Similarly, empowering schools through direct interventions,\n            designed to generate greater school commitment to the\n            project's development objectives, was conducive to\n            success. This was demonstrated by an initial evaluation of\n            the School Development Plan, which concluded that students\n            under this plan performed better on assessment tests, and\n            other dependent variables, such as student promotion rates.\n            The popularity of these new educational development plans,\n            presented the dilemma of expanding the project's\n            success, though the project had reached its full training,\n            and financial resources to bear.

 strengthen primary schools and the public institutions that\n            are responsible for them within a coordinated management\n            framework, in order to increase the participation, promotion\n            and graduation rates, and achievement levels of children in\n            the North and Center-West capital microregions of Brazil.\n            There are four components. The first raises schools to\n            minimum operational standards through educating and\n            certifying teachers, supplying basic furniture and\n            equipment, financing school improvement investments, and\n            financing school-managed rehabilitation of physical\n            facilities. The second component establishes a school\n            development process by designing and supporting school\n            development plans; and financing school subprojects. The\n            third component carries out school microplanning and\n            develops and tests standard architectural plans for\n            additional school places. The fourth component builds\n            management capacity in schools, municipalities, and states;\n            provides specialized teaching and learning improvement\n            programs; fosters community participation; strengthens\n            national education information systems and programs; and\n            finances project management."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Brazil - School Improvement
