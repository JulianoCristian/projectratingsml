Data presented\n            in Annex 10 show that during the project period (1995-2001)\n            the greatest rate of forest loss during the project was in\n            the Kabupatens Kerinci and Solok which received the largest\n            proportion of Village Conservation Grants (VCGs). This\n            indicates that the linkage between village/district level\n            activities and biodiversity conservation failed. A key\n            constraint throughout project implementation has been poor\n            and indifferent coordination and collaboration between\n            different agencies within the Ministry of Forestry. The\n            overall sustainability of the project is rated as\n            \"unlikely\" mainly because of the lack of regular\n            budget and insufficient institutional capacity to implement\n            the management plan. The Bank's performance in project\n            identification and design was unsatisfactory. Supervision\n            performance was satisfactory. Overall Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory. The Borrower's overall performance is\n            rated as unsatisfactory also, mainly because of overall\n            project management and supervision. A number of lessons was\n            learned or reinforced during the implementation of the\n            project. Some of the most important were: 1) The project was\n            probably overly complex, with too many activities and\n            institutions involved and no overall coordination. 2) The\n            original project design was an ambitious attempt to\n            integrate the national park and conservation objectives\n            within regional and spatial planning. As preparation\n            continued, the emphasis evolved away from major development\n            planning to a focus on small-scale village development based\n            on the (flawed) assumption that poverty and the lack of\n            alternative livelihoods were driving deforestation and\n            agricultural encroachment into the park (they might have\n            been a contributing factor, but were not the main one). 3)\n            There was never any commitment from the Bank to a\n            multi-phased project (e.g., as might have been achieved via\n            an Adaptable Program Loan) nor was any real strategy\n            developed to ensure that provincial/kabupaten governments\n            could sustain integrated activities beyond the\n            project's lifetime. 4) An overall institutional\n            analysis was not undertaken as part of project design.\n            Budget flows and delays in budget delivery were a serious\n            constraint (which will be further exacerbated by the new\n            Presidential Decree (Kepres 42) which prevents multi-year\n            budgeting. 5) Changing the behavior of societies is complex\n            and slow, and understanding the incentives for certain types\n            of behavior is of key importance. Where forests are also\n            under threat from outsiders, unenforceable covenants of\n            uncertain value are unlikely to be successful. One\n            conclusion is that the same conservation benefits might have\n            been achieved by a simpler project design focusing on\n            interventions in all 460 villages and more directly\n            concerned with conservation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Kerinci Seblat Integrated\n            Conservation and Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Kerinci Seblat\n            Integrated Conservation and Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/06/2416074/indonesia-kerinci-seblat-integrated-conservation-development-project","projn":"ID-Kerinci Seblat Icdp -- P004014","docty":"Implementation Completion and Results Report","subtopic":"Wetlands,Agricultural Research,Forestry,Environmental Management,Environmental Economics & Policies","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000160016_20030708130947"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,audits,Biodiversity,biodiversity\n            conservation,biodiversity research,birds,buffer\n            zones,capacity building,cattle,Center for International\n            Forestry Research,community forestry,Concession\n            Management,conservation activities,conservation\n            estate,conservation of biodiversity,Conservation of\n            Nature,conservation\n            value,cropping,deforestation,deforestation rates,economic\n            development,endangered species,Environmental\n            policies,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,farming,farms,Forest,forest agency,Forest\n            Concession,forest concessions,forest conversion,forest\n            cover,forest ecosystem,forest ecosystems,forest\n            habitat,forest lands,forest loss,Forest Management,Forest\n            Protection,Forestry,forestry activities,forests,Geographic\n            Information,GIS,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT\n            FACILITY,Global Environmental\n            Facility,habitats,income,innovation,Land management,land\n            use,land-use,land-use planning,living\n            conditions,logging,national parks,Natural\n            Resources,parks,planting,provincial forest,quality\n            control,recreation,Reforestation,regional environmental\n            assessment,regional planning,research grants,resource\n            management,Rural Development,sustainable forest\n            management,sustainable management,Timber,Timber Forest\n            Products,tropical forests"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,audits,Biodiversity,biodiversity\n            conservation,biodiversity research,birds,buffer\n            zones,capacity building,cattle,Center for International\n            Forestry Research,community forestry,Concession\n            Management,conservation activities,conservation\n            estate,conservation of biodiversity,Conservation of\n            Nature,conservation\n            value,cropping,deforestation,deforestation rates,economic\n            development,endangered species,Environmental\n            policies,Exchange\n            Rate,expenditures,farming,farms,Forest,forest agency,Forest\n            Concession,forest concessions,forest conversion,forest\n            cover,forest ecosystem,forest ecosystems,forest\n            habitat,forest lands,forest loss,Forest Management,Forest\n            Protection,Forestry,forestry activities,forests,Geographic\n            Information,GIS,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT\n            FACILITY,Global Environmental\n            Facility,habitats,income,innovation,Land management,land\n            use,land-use,land-use planning,living\n            conditions,logging,national parks,Natural\n            Resources,parks,planting,provincial forest,quality\n            control,recreation,Reforestation,regional environmental\n            assessment,regional planning,research grants,resource\n            management,Rural Development,sustainable forest\n            management,sustainable management,Timber,Timber Forest\n            Products,tropical forests"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF022535-PHRD-BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION PROJ.,TF023560-NORWEGIAN GRANT FOR ENVIRONMENT\n            - ASTEN,TF028184-REG.

A host of development pressures,\n            such as access proposals, encroachment from shifting\n            cultivation and cinnamon plantations, and logging in the\n            lowland forests, compound the threat to the area's\n            biodiversity value, particularly the destruction of habitats\n            neded for the long-term protection and maintenance of\n            wildlife species. Among the Kerinci-Seblat RIA's\n            purpose is the evaluation of: (1) the potential impacts of\n            adjacent development activities on biodiversity conservation\n            and park integrity; and (2) the negative impacts of the\n            Kerinci-Seblat's Integrated Conservation and\n            Development Project (ICDP) design on opportunities for\n            future economic development. Any new roads built have to be\n            accompanied by the strengthening of enforcement capability\n            to prevent human encroachment, the park's fragmentation\n            into isolated blocks, animal migration, and the loss of\n            genetic resources. Restrictions on mining activities will\n            have the following impacts and mitigations: (1) No further\n            mining concessions will be granted; (2) Mineral exploration\n            can continue,for five years, after which the concessions\n            will be cancelled uncompensated if no economically viable\n            mineral potential is determined; (3) The acceptability of\n            mining will be determined on a case-by-cas (4) Ore\n            processing should be by closed-circuit cyanide process, and\n            ore belonging to small gold miners should be subsidized in\n            order to lessen the miners' dependence on mercury.\n            Because of these restrictions, the impact of the park and\n            ICDP on mineral resource development should be minimal. To\n            prevent further human encroachment, a 3-year moratorium\n            should be placed on new road construction. Effectively\n            managing the buffer zones around the park will require\n            agriculture crop zoning guidelines. Educating farmers about\n            choosing crops and practices and providing program\n            incentives will help protect biodiversity. Licensed\n            handlogging will control the timber used up in community\n            forests, which originated from protected forests."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Indonesia - Kerinci-Seblat Integrated\n            Conservation and Development Project : regional impact assessment"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Indonesia - Kerinci-Seblat\n            Integrated Conservation and Development Project : regional\n            impact assessment"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1995/03/441304/indonesia-kerinci-seblat-integrated-conservation-development-project-regional-impact-assessment","projn":"ID-Kerinci Seblat Icdp -- P004014","subtopic":"Common Property Resource Development,Wetlands,Earth Sciences & GIS,Forestry,Agricultural Research","docty":"Environmental Assessment","teratopic":"Water Resources","count":"Indonesia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Southeast Asia!$!80471"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3970716150425"},"subsc":"Other social services","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","colti":"World Development Sources, WDS 1997-2","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Resources","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Environment","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animal\n            species,Biodiversity,biodiversity\n            conservation,birds,boundaries,catchment,climate,climatic\n            variations,commodities,community\n            forests,compensation,concession,concession\n            management,conifers,conservation\n            reserves,cropping,cultivation,deforestation,drainage,Drainage\n            Systems,ecology,ecosystems,endangered\n            species,FAO,flooding,floodplains,flora,forest\n            concession,forest concessions,Forest Inventory,forest\n            land,forest land use,forest lands,Forest Management,forest\n            production,forest products,Forest\n            Protection,forestry,forests,freshwater,genetic\n            resources,Geology,grasses,habitats,headwaters,Herbaceous\n            vegetation,hills,Hunting,igneous rocks,impact\n            assessment,land area,land use,land\n            uses,landform,Landforms,legal protection,logging,mineral\n            deposits,Mountains,Natural\n            Resource,ore,parks,peat,Physiographic Regions,Physiographic\n            Zones,plains,plantations,precipitation,rainfall,rainforest,rainforests,river\n            systems,rivers,Rural Development,sedimentary\n            rocks,shrubs,soil,soils,Southeast Asia,southern\n            hemisphere,study area,sustainable\n            agriculture,swamps,timber,timber production,timber\n            species,topography,tree\n            species,trees,tundra,valleys,vegetation,vegetation\n            patterns,Vegetation\n            Zones,watershed,West,wetlands,wildlife,wildlife species,Wood"},"1":{"cdata!":"agriculture,animal\n            species,Biodiversity,biodiversity\n            conservation,birds,boundaries,catchment,climate,climatic\n            variations,commodities,community\n            forests,compensation,concession,concession\n            management,conifers,conservation\n            reserves,cropping,cultivation,deforestation,drainage,Drainage\n            Systems,ecology,ecosystems,endangered\n            species,FAO,flooding,floodplains,flora,forest\n            concession,forest concessions,Forest Inventory,forest\n            land,forest land use,forest lands,Forest Management,forest\n            production,forest products,Forest\n            Protection,forestry,forests,freshwater,genetic\n            resources,Geology,grasses,habitats,headwaters,Herbaceous\n            vegetation,hills,Hunting,igneous rocks,impact\n            assessment,land area,land use,land\n            uses,landform,Landforms,legal protection,logging,mineral\n            deposits,Mountains,Natural\n            Resource,ore,parks,peat,Physiographic Regions,Physiographic\n            Zones,plains,plantations,precipitation,rainfall,rainforest,rainforests,river\n            systems,rivers,Rural Development,sedimentary\n            rocks,shrubs,soil,soils,Southeast Asia,southern\n            hemisphere,study area,sustainable\n            agriculture,swamps,timber,timber production,timber\n            species,topography,tree\n            species,trees,tundra,valleys,vegetation,vegetation\n            patterns,Vegetation\n            Zones,watershed,West,wetlands,wildlife,wildlife species,Wood"}},"owner":"Rural Dev, Nat Res & Envmt (EASRE)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Southeast Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF028184-REG.
