The\n            performances of both the World Bank and the Borrower were\n            evaluated as satisfactory. These were the lessons learned:\n            1) Communities tend to remain together during displacement\n            and return as a group to their areas of origin, once the\n            security conditions are favorable. Communities tend to be\n            committed to engaging proactively in the rehabilitation of\n            social and community infrastructure destroyed during the\n            war, even if it means rebuilding structures from scratch. 2)\n            In the preparation of future resettlement support\n            operations, it is critical that displaced persons'\n            resettlement patterns and the phased nature of the\n            resettlement process be taken into consideration. Displaced\n            families require minimal support as an incentive for\n            returning to their villages. The primary need identified by\n            resettling families is food security. While the goal is for\n            communities to attain food security through community-based\n            agricultural production, it is crucial that returning\n            families have access to adequate food rations as they await\n            the harvest of their first crop. Furthermore, close\n            coordination is required with other externally supported\n            initiatives and line ministries to improve access to health,\n            education and other basic services. During implementation,\n            it also became apparent that more emphasis needs to be\n            placed on the special needs of the very large number of\n            female-headed households and orphaned children. 3) The roles\n            and responsibilities of nongovernmental organizations\n            (NGOs), communities and local governments need to be clearly\n            defined and fostered through meaningful capacity building,\n            close collaboration among actors, and mentoring. In order to\n            enable municipal authorities to play a gradually more\n            substantial role in project implementation, capacity\n            building at the local government level needs to be provided\n            in a more systematic, integrated, and timely fashion.\n            Careful screening of NGOs is crucial to ensure cost\n            effective project implementation. In addition, it may be\n            more effective to contract the services of several NGOs in\n            their particular areas of specialization, rather than\n            choosing a single NGO per municipality. Also, up-front\n            training is required to ensure that implementing NGOs have a\n            clear understanding of financial management and reporting\n            requirements to ensure timely disbursement. In addition, a\n            clear entry and exit strategy needs to be defined for NGOs.\n            4) A satellite-approach proved to be a cost-effective\n            implementation system. The approach entails forming and\n            training implementation committees in each of a limited\n            number of core villages, which also supports Project\n            activities in select neighboring satellite villages."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Angola -
