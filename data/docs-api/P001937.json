Besides the\n            traditional staples, millet and sorghum, the area also\n            produces increasing quantities of rice and is starting to\n            produce sugar. Under the project, this road will be\n            realigned and paved for all-weather use. The\n            Magaria-Tinkim-Nigerian border (20 km) and Dan Tyao-Tinkim\n            (14 km) roads will be used mainly for the export of\n            groundnuts from central Niger through Nigeria. Their\n            improvement will substantially reduce exporters'\n            transportation costs. This implies, however, that Nigeria\n            will also improve the road linking the road from the Niger\n            border to the city of Kano in northern Nigeria."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Niger - \u00c9valuation du deuxi\u00e8me projet routier"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Niger - Second Highway Project :\n            Niger - \u00c9valuation du deuxi\u00e8me projet routier"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1970/12/15580013/niger-second-highway-project-niger-\u00e9valuation-du-deuxi\u00e8me-projet-routier","projn":"NE-Road II -- P001937","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","subtopic":"Airports and Air Services,Urban Housing,Business in Development,Roads & Highways,Business Environment","teratopic":"Urban Development,Transport,Private Sector Development","count":"Niger","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"},"3":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sahel!$!Sahel"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20111226023145"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Transportation projects series,no.
