The project has been successfully implemented\n            in regard to its physical facilities and appears on the way\n            to achieving its educational objectives but the attempt to\n            introduce a diversified curriculum in the secondary schools\n            was slowed by a lack of teachers to teach the subjects and\n            difficulties in finding space for the subjects on an already\n            crowded secondary timetable. Other problems of this project\n            were educational and arose in part because bilateral\n            sources, on which the project was relying to supply\n            specialist teachers of various kinds were unable to provide\n            the teachers in the numbers required. Basically, the\n            objectives of the curriculum development center are being\n            achieved, as are those of expansion of technical schools. In\n            respect to the secondary education component the expansion\n            of facilities and introduction of the new courses was\n            reached. But, at the time of the completion mission, school\n            enrollments had only reached 55 percent of the new\n            facilities capacity and full utilization was unlikely to be\n            achieved for a few years since enrollments were being\n            increased by only one level annually. The assistance to\n            teacher training, evaluation, and non-formal education\n            programs were all successful."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho - Second Education Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Lesotho -
