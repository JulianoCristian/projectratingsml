- Sustainable Land Management Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Sustainable Land\n            Management (SLM) Project for Ethiopia were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, global environmental\n            objective (GEO) outcomes were moderately satisfactory, risk\n            to development outcome was moderate, risk to GEO outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: establishing and scaling up SLM\n            can be facilitated by putting in place a programmatic\n            approach that can deliver multiple benefits downstream\n            despite upstream transaction costs associated with convening\n            and aligning financing, experiences, and approaches among\n            partners and stakeholders. SLM should be considered as an\n            integral part of rural development strategies that can\n            deliver livelihood opportunities and improving environmental\n            security. The demand-driven bottom-up approach adopted under\n            SLMP-1 is relevant for natural resources management and\n            local development in Ethiopia's rural space. It is\n            important to provide enhanced support in technical design\n            and implementation and operation and maintenance (O and M)\n            of subprojects involving road improvements and small\n            irrigation, as well as structural and vegetative land\n            management practices. The need to build sustainable\n            institutions at the local level is equally important since\n            they are crucial for delivery of service and attainment of\n            project objectives. Implementation of the project was\n            initially constrained by inadequate monitoring and\n            evaluation (M and E) capacity and poor financial management\n            and procurement capacity at the Woreda level coupled with a\n            high staff turnover. The experience of SLMP-1 highlights the\n            importance of enhanced recruitment procedures, appropriate\n            incentive mechanism (working conditions, training, etc.),\n            and harmonization of salaries and benefits among Woreda\n            staff working on different projects. To maximize\n            dissemination (both within Ethiopia and the Africa region),\n            visibility and perception of project actions and results,\n            the implementation of SLMP-1 demonstrated the importance of\n            including, within the structure of the Ministry of\n            Agriculture (MoA), a knowledge management and communications\n            team staffed by

Project (SLM) in Ethiopia is to reduce land\n            degradation in agricultural landscapes and to improve the\n            agricultural productivity of smallholder farmers. There are\n            three components to the project. The first component is the\n            watershed management. It is aimed at supporting scaling up\n            of best management practices in sustainable land management\n            practices and technologies for smallholder farmers in the\n            high potential/food secure areas that are increasingly\n            becoming vulnerable to land degradation and food insecurity.\n            The second component is the rural land certification and\n            administration. The objective of this component is to expand\n            the coverage and enhance the government's land\n            certification project, with the aim of strengthening land\n            tenure security for smallholder farmers. The third component\n            is the project management. The focus of this component is to\n            provide financial and technical assistance to the federal\n            ministry of agriculture and rural development and local\n            government units responsible for sustainable land management\n            to effectively support coordination and implementation of\n            the SLM project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia -
