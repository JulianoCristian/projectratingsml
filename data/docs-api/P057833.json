Some lessons\n            learned included: importance of public support in\n            environmental policy implementation. It has been shown that\n            important environment related decision with large social\n            implications can be executed with public support. The\n            importance of working with stakeholders was stressed from\n            the beginning, and this paid off. During project\n            preparation, a stakeholder delegation was sent to India to\n            observe how central and local governments in India are\n            tackling urban air pollution, and to discuss options for\n            mitigating transport emissions. It was difficult to\n            understand why a non-industrial city like Dhaka, with flat\n            terrain, 300,000 vehicles, and not much pronounced biomass\n            burning, could be so heavily polluted. During project\n            preparation, the cause was found in that many of the 50,000\n            two-stroke engine three wheelers in Dhaka are: (a) using\n            more than double the quantity of lubricant recommended by\n            vehicle manufacturers; and (b) using straight mineral oil, a\n            lubricant not intended for use in vehicles. It is not only\n            the people living in the urban areas are the victim of air\n            pollution the rural people particularly the poor as well are\n            the direct victim of indoor air pollution. To reduce health\n            cost because of indoor air pollution a multi-pronged\n            approach is needed where technology and environmental\n            aspects could be well taken care of."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bangladesh -
