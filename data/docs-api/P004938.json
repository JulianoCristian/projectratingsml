The\n            key lessons learned from this project include: 1) More\n            realistic project implementation periods are required in\n            situations where more than one implementing institutions is\n            involved and/or where the public bureaucracy is known to be\n            particularly cumbersome; 2) More analytical work is needed\n            for the treatment of the institutional aspects in the\n            formulation of irrigation projects. 3) More efficient\n            supervision approaches are required in situations where the\n            Bank's field supervisions by Bank staff are limited. 4)\n            The setting up of a proper monitoring & evaluation\n            system is crucial to an efficient project implementation and\n            should take place at the very beginning of the project. 5)\n            The use of heavy machinery for civil works in small farms is\n            problematic and should be considered with great care. 6) In\n            cases where loans are closed with important project\n            activities remaining to be carried out, and where most of\n            the benefits stated at appraisal could still be achieved,\n            the Bank should formulate an action program with the\n            Government for the purpose of reinforcing the implementation\n            plan set at appraisal."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algeria -
