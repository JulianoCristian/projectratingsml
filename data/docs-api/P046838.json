Over-fishing and oxygen depletion at lower\n            depths threaten fisheries and biodiversity. Algae blooms\n            have developed on the surface and water hyacinth have begun\n            to choke waterways and landings. The Lake Victoria\n            Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) planned to reverse\n            the deterioration of the aquatic resources and the\n            environmental conditions of the lake's ecosystem and\n            the maximize the sustainable benefits to the surrounding\n            communities. A Request was submitted by Resources Conflict\n            Institute (RECONCILE), a Kenyan non-governmental\n            organization, that the proposed use of a mechanical method\n            of shredding water hyacinth and letting it sink to the\n            bottom of the lake would result in ecological and\n            environmental degradation which, in turn, would adversely\n            affect communities living on the shores of Lake Victoria.\n            After evaluating the request and examining the claims, the\n            Panel determined that the water hyacinth was a major threat\n            to the livelihood of surrounding communities and that the\n            possible polluting affects of decaying shredded hyacinths\n            was convincing. The Panel finds that program of shredding\n            the water hyacinths has been beneficial to the majority of\n            inhabitants and finds that the Bank is in compliance with\n            their own regulations. Other findings note that alternatives\n            to the mechanical shredders were considered and that\n            although there is no clear path as to how the shredding\n            operations will continue there is no evidence to imply that\n            the shredding process will not be unsustainable in view of cost."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Kenya - Lake Victoria Environmental\n            Management Project : Inspection Panel Report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Kenya - Lake Victoria\n            Environmental Management Project : Inspection Panel Report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2000/12/3044628/kenya-lake-victoria-environmental-management-project-inspection-panel-report","projn":"KE-Lake Victoria Env.

The\n            Requestors claim that the proposed use of a mechanical\n            method of shredding water hyacinth and letting it sink to\n            the bottom of the Lake will result in ecological decay and\n            environmental degradation that, in turn, will adversely\n            affect communities living on the shores at the Nyanza Gulf.\n            These communities depend directly on the Lake for their\n            livelihoods, since the Gulf is home to fresh water fish and\n            the source of water for domestic use and these, and the\n            ecosystem, will be endangered by the resulting pollution.\n            Management feels that this is a misunderstanding in that the\n            proposed method is only a pilot project and is not a means\n            to solve the hyacinth problem. Measures are being taken to\n            insure more community involvement in the project and to\n            raise awareness of activities. The Panel feels that there\n            are conflicting issues and responses in the Request and the\n            Response and that an investigation would better enable a\n            conclusion.

A further project objective is to\n            harmonize national management programs in order to achieve,\n            to the maximum extent possible, the reversal of increasing\n            environmental degradation.
