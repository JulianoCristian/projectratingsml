The main objectives of the\n            project were: (i) to create temporary employment by means of\n            labor-intensive technologies; (ii) to increase the\n            productivity of Bamako and its vicinity by means of a\n            program of urgently needed small-scale public works; (iii)\n            to increase the capacity of the public sector to orient and\n            manage efficiently its demandfor, and expenditures on, goods\n            and services and to demonstrate the feasibility of more\n            transparent procurement procedures; (iv) to improve public\n            procu4re ment by strengthening the Direction Generale des\n            Marches Publics (DGMP); and (v) to strengthen the capacity\n            of the private sector, small and medium-sized contractors\n            and consulting firms, to design and execute a wide range of\n            public works. Bank's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            success through an autonomous and transparent institutional\n            model; (ii) developing capacity for operations and\n            maintenance (O&M) to ensure sustainability of\n            sub-projects; (iii) the need for decentralization and\n            replication; (iv) payments without delay to ensure\n            development of local contractors; and (v) technical\n            assistance to improve the quality of works."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mali - Public Works and Capacity Building
