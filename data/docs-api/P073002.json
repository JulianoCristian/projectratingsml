Lessons learned include: this project has\n            benefited from a very close alignment of China's\n            national interest with local demand in overcoming inequities\n            between boys and girls, between Han and ethnic minorities,\n            and within and between provinces. There was a close match of\n            the Bank and Department for International Development's\n            (DfID's) partnership strategies with the Government of\n            China's (GoC's). The outcome indicators enabled\n            the assessment as to whether the project had achieved the\n            Project Development Objective (PDO). The use of Chinese\n            Expert Panel forged a link between national-level experts\n            and provincial level experts, resulting in transfer of\n            knowledge and skills. This addressed a critical capacity\n            constraint at the local level. The impact evaluation will be\n            more effective if it was planned at the time of project\n            preparation. The baseline data collection exercise should\n            take place before the delivery of inputs. Signing on to the\n            impact evaluation could be a condition for the counties to\n            participate in the project in order to obtain the highest\n            level of cooperation and to maximize the use of the findings\n            to improve practices. The Wenchuan Earthquake is a wake-up\n            call for all Bank projects in countries with seismic\n            activities. It is worthwhile to engage civil engineers to\n            look into the construction standards and structural\n            soundness of the designs for schools. It is also worthwhile\n            to build into co-curricular activities drills for evacuation\n            and first aid."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Basic Education in Western Areas

This Indigenous\n            peoples Plan (IPP) provides specific actions to be taken\n            (Annex 1) during project implementation, Annex 2 identifies\n            the statistics regarding minorities in the different project\n            areas, while annex 3 outlines the ethnic minorities\n            education strategy. The demand for child labor among ethnic\n            minorities - largely living, and working in agriculture or\n            herding - is very high, which conflicts with the costs of\n            sending a child to school, thus accounting for late\n            enrollments, absenteeism from school, and/or drop out cases.\n            As well, educational attainment of the adult population, and\n            its impact on minority family aspirations for the education\n            of their children, demonstrate the high illiteracy rates,\n            and susceptibility to cycles of poverty. Basic education\n            will be expanded, consistent with the Ministry of\n            Education's standard criteria for all schools, to\n            include as well existing minority language textbooks, and\n            identified supplementary reading materials at the Provincial\n            level, prepared jointly with the Chinese Experts Panel.\n            Special attention will be provided to girl's education,\n            their enrollment, and school attendance, while distance\n            education alternatives shall be provided for remote areas.\n            The capacities of local departments of education will be\n            strengthened to administer educational policies that include\n            minority education strategies."},"docna":{"cdata!":"China - Basic Education in Western Provinces\n            Project : indigenous peoples plan"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"China - Basic Education in\n            Western Provinces Project : indigenous peoples plan"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2003/03/2219204/china-basic-education-western-provinces-project-indigenous-peoples-plan","projn":"CN-Basic Education In Western Areas -- P073002","subtopic":"ICT Data and Statistics,Health Information & Communications Technologies,Agricultural Research,Health Indicators","docty":"Indigenous Peoples Plan","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Information and Communication Technologies","count":"China","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Asia!$!517198"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000094946_03041604045530"},"theme":"Education for all,Gender,Participation and civic engagement,Rural services and infrastructure,Indigenous peoples","subsc":"Sub-national government administration,Central government administration,Primary education","admreg":"East Asia and Pacific,East Asia and Pacific","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population,Agriculture,Information and Communication Technologies","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Education","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"mou,total population"},"1":{"cdata!":"mou,total population"}},"owner":"Education - GP (GEDDR)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"1":{"geo_region":"Asia"},"2":{"geo_region":"Asia"}},"trustfund":"TF026649-PHRD-CHINA: BASIC EDUCATION IN\n            WESTERN AREAS (BANK-EXECUTED),TF026772-PHRD-CHINA: BASIC EDUCATION IN\n            WESTERN AREAS (RECIPIENT-EXECUTED)","majtheme":"Human development,Rural development,Social dev/gender/inclusion","repnb":"IPP36"},"2488134":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/08/2488134/china-basic-education-western-areas-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2002/08/2488134/china-basic-education-western-areas-project","new_url":"2002/08/2488134/china-basic-education-western-areas-project","disclosure_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/08/21/000090341_20030821131546/Rendered/INDEX/251720CN.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2003/08/21/000090341_20030821131546/Rendered/PDF/251720CN.pdf","datestored":"2003-08-21T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2002-08-13T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Final","versiontyp_key":"1309935","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"China - Basic Education in Western Areas Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The development objectives for the\n            project are to improved access to and completion of\n            affordable and quality basic education for poor boys and\n            girls in Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan Provinces, Ningxia Hui and\n            Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regions.

Project\n            Monitoring: The monitoring will be managed at the county and\n            provincial levels by project implementations offices, under\n            the supervision of the Foreign Investment and Loan Office\n            (FILO) of the Ministry of Education (MOE). Institutional\n            Development: This subcomponent will strengthen the\n            management skills at the provincial and county levels.\n            Component 3. Implementing Strategies to Improve the Quality\n            of Teaching and Learning: This component seeks to strengthen\n            the delivery of teacher training services to improve the\n            poor quality and limited coverage of qualified teachers,\n            including bilingual and multi-grade teachers in primary and\n            junior secondary schools, and upgrading the quality of\n            temporary (daike) teachers. Rural Education Reform Pilots:\n            This subcomponent will support the research in support of\n            current education policy reforms in areas of direct\n            strategic interest
