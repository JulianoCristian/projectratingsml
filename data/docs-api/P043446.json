deployment and use of its\n            financial resources through changes in the institutional\n            structure of public finance and in the budgeting process.\n            The PFMP will focus on the key initiatives of the\n            Government's program of public financial management\n            reform and will be organized into four components. The\n            budget preparation component will assist in development and\n            implementation of improvements for budget preparation,\n            macroeconomic forecasting and preparation of forward\n            estimation, and training staff for the revised budget system\n            implementation.  The treasury operations component will\n            introduce the Treasury Ledger System, develop effective cash\n            management methodologies, and establish revised budget\n            execution processes and a new treasury system.  Work under\n            the debt management component will involve the development\n            of improvements for the recording, reporting and issuance of\n            government debt, and a training strategy for the\n            implementation of the revised debt management system.  The\n            public finance management information systems network will\n            put in place policies, procedures and standards that will\n            ensure coordination among
