Some lessons learned\n            included:  deep reforms changing the patterns of governance\n            and public sector management require adequate preparation,\n            including political economy assessment, consensus building\n            effort and wide political and social ownership. In the\n            absence of such thorough preparation, the likelihood of\n            success is low, irrespective of potentially huge long-run\n            gains for the country and society. In the post-conflict\n            environment, a development policy operation (DPO) instrument\n            can be effective if the reform program is well calibrated to\n            a context of weak technical capacity and multiple\n            priorities. In both countries, and for each operation,\n            ownership of reforms was permanently elusive, and was only\n            assured fleetingly by the lure of arrears clearance or debt\n            relief. Ownership of reforms by respective governments\n            followed a pattern of temporary commitment to reforms for\n            immediate returns. Incentives to governments, leadership and\n            ground conditions lacked for a successful pursuit of the\n            ambitious reform agenda in both counties."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo,

- Post-Conflict Economic\n            Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Project ratings are as follows: Project\n            outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; Borrower performance is satisfactory. A key\n            lesson is that a small but timely and well designed\n            operation can make a significant contribution to\n            consolidating peace, reviving the economy and helping a\n            post-conflict country get away from the conflict trap. A\n            second lesson is the importance of receiving strong signals\n            of Government commitment to reform. In this case, commitment\n            was shown by reform efforts launched by Government, with its\n            own resources, prior to credit approval. A third lesson is\n            that parallel implementation of other mutually reinforcing\n            lending operations, notably those providing technical\n            assistance, can improve the chances of success. In\n            post-conflict countries, a comprehensive, not a partial,\n            approach seems more likely to yield quick and positive\n            results. A fourth lesson is that for a post-conflict country\n            like the Congo, privatization goals should not be too\n            ambitious. Efforts to privatize the water and electricity\n            utilities, and the railways, were less successful than\n            expected because potential investors viewed the risk of\n            undertaking large investment as too high A fifth lesson is\n            that for a post-conflict country with limited implementation\n            capacity, the design of the project should be kept as simple\n            as possible. Although this project had only two main\n            components, the number of its sub-components (at least six)\n            was rather high."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Congo - Post-Conflict Economic\n            Rehabilitation Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Congo -

It is the first operation of the TSS that supports\n            implementation of 1) key structural reforms; and 2) improved\n            governance and better transparency in managing the\n            country's natural wealth and public funds. These\n            reforms are needed to stabilize and bring about the economic\n            rehabilitation that will pave the way for broad-based\n            poverty reduction, and a higher and sustained growth path in\n            the years ahead, after three decades of centrally planned\n            economic management and almost a decade of war. Proceeds of\n            the Credit will provide critical funds needed to assist the\n            Republic of Congo with foreign exchange cash immediately\n            after arrears to the Bank have been paid. The Credit will be\n            disbursed in a single tranche, and implemented in parallel\n            with the Transparency and Governance Capacity Building\n            Project (see
