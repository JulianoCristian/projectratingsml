As per the Emergency Recovery and Disaster\n            Management Program (ERDMP) Project, the audit largely\n            concurs with the ICR ratings of a satisfactory project\n            outcome, likely sustainability, substantial institutional\n            development impacts, and satisfactory performances by both\n            the Bank and Borrower. Lessons of experience are suggested\n            as follows. The Bank needs to be more involved in the\n            immediate post-emergency period, and it needs to be able to\n            quickly fund activities that do not require detailed\n            preparation, but it needs to take the necessary time to\n            prepare infrastructure rehabilitation components that\n            require careful attention to design. The experience of these\n            two projects illustrates the perils of inadequate attention\n            to design, including taking into account the motivation and\n            perceptions of key stakeholders. In the absence of borrower\n            staff experienced in Bank procurement practices, early\n            training and support needs to be provided, especially under\n            the time pressures that are normal for emergency operations.\n            Specifically, when intervening in the natural behavior of a\n            river, it should be realized that there is a danger of\n            triggering unexpected and negative effects. For this reason\n            it is sometimes preferable to keep land adjoining rivers\n            free of construction, and to allow the river to have some\n            freedom of movement. Moreover, in order to work out a\n            feasible action plan for watershed and environmental\n            management it is imperative to identify the main constraints\n            hampering sound management. In St. Lucia, constraints have\n            included turf issues between relevant public institutions,\n            the movement of farming to the hillsides, the nature of\n            local crops, and local perceptions of hazards (causes and\n            remedies). Therefore, with adequate preparation,\n            infrastructure can be rebuilt in three years, but creating\n            viable institutions at the national, district, and community\n            level takes much longer. Grappling with well entrenched\n            environmental bad practice is even more challenging and time-consuming."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Saint Lucia - Watershed and Environmental\n            Management, and, Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management\n            Program Projects"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Saint Lucia -

All the development objectives\n            were achieved. Overall Bank performance is rated as highly\n            satisfactory. The sustainability of project outputs will\n            depend significantly on the availability of funds. Borrower\n            performance in preparation of the project is rated as highly\n            satisfactory, while in project implementation it is rated as\n            satisfactory. The key factors affecting the performance\n            were: rapid project processing; strong borrower ownership;\n            flexible procurement procedures; effective civil works\n            maintenance; stringent environmental guidelines; and\n            positive social impact. The key lessons learned are as\n            follows. Quick, effective, and coordinated response from the\n            Bank and other lending agencies is fundamental to achieving\n            satisfactory results in emergency situations. The\n            Bank's acceptance of maximum flexibility of procurement\n            procedures for civil works and goods was of critical\n            importance to ensuring fast implementation. However,\n            environmental guidelines need to be infringed upon because\n            of necessary speed in design or execution of civil works. An\n            adequate balance should be sought between swiftness in\n            action, accuracy in design, compliance with environmental\n            guidelines, and proper use of local knowledge. The active\n            participation of affected communities is important in\n            achieving effective and sustainable management of watershed\n            areas. The infusion of local knowledge from national staff\n            can be important in the design of emergency operations,\n            especially given the short time window and complicated\n            nature of the interventions. Finally, the experience of this\n            project illustrates how strong Borrower ownership and\n            commitment contributes to smooth, effective, and timely implementation."},"docna":{"cdata!":"St. Lucia -
