Political\n            instability hindered implementation, conducive to\n            unsatisfactory performances by both the Bank, and the\n            Borrower. The key lessons convey that, both institutional\n            development, and broader capacity building objectives were\n            not substantially achieved, and within this context, it is\n            worth mentioning that development imperatives were not fully\n            incorporated into the mainstream policies, and programs of\n            the Addis Ababa City Government (AACG), thus fundamental\n            policy reforms, did not influence the program, nor any\n            significant issues within AACG as an institution. It is\n            suggested that, while the city, i.e., AACG should remain\n            responsible for the provision of basic public services, it\n            should not be required that all services be delivered by\n            AACG, rather alternative service delivery should be\n            explored. Given the high transaction costs in financing, and\n            supervising individual subprojects, the Bank should provide\n            \"assistance\" in capacity building, to further\n            concentrate on the financial aspects. The Bank did however,\n            address the issue of institutional strengthening, to\n            articulate capacity actions, and initiate involvement with\n            stakeholders, but changes in management leadership halted\n            preparation efforts. It remains imperative to enable the\n            city's program, and financial management capacity, to\n            address poverty, and basic services delivery."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Ethiopia - Second Addis Ababa Urban\n            Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Ethiopia -
