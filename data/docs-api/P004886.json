linking Algiers to the eastern part\n            of the country and for consulting services and staff\n            training at an estimated total cost of US$101.6 million\n            equivalent. The Bank loan for the project will be US$41.5\n            million, which represents the foreign exchange cost. The\n            development of the road network has not kept pace with the\n            rapid growth of road transport in recent years. Heavy\n            traffic volumes on roads with inadequate design standards\n            have resulted in high road transport costs, unacceptable\n            levels of traffic congestion and a heavy accident toll. The\n            Government is aware of the need for adequate roads if growth\n            of the total economy is not to be impeded. It intends to\n            raise road investments, realizing that shortages of\n            qualified and experienced staff will have to be remedied and\n            that organizational improvements

linking Algiers to the eastern part\n            of the country and for consulting services and staff\n            training at an estimated total cost of US$101.6 million\n            equivalent. The Bank loan for the project will be US$41.5\n            million, which represents the foreign exchange cost. The\n            development of the road network has not kept pace with the\n            rapid growth of road transport in recent years. Heavy\n            traffic volumes on roads with inadequate design standards\n            have resulted in high road transport costs, unacceptable\n            levels of traffic congestion and a heavy accident toll. The\n            Government is aware of the need for adequate roads if growth\n            of the total economy is not to be impeded. It intends to\n            raise road investments, realizing that shortages of\n            qualified and experienced staff will have to be remedied and\n            that organizational improvements may have to be made to\n            ensure the proper execution of an expanding investment program."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Algerie - Evaluation D'un Deuxieme\n            Projet Routier"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Alg\u00e9rie \u2013 Deuxi\u00e8me projet routier\n            : Alg\u00e9rie\u00a0- \u00c9valuation d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me projet routier"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1977/04/11779849/algeria-second-highway-project-algerie-evaluation-dun-deuxieme-projet-routier","projn":"DZ-Highways Ii-268866 -- P004886","subtopic":"Urban Transport,Rural Roads & Transport,Airports and Air Services,Roads & Highways,Banks & Banking Reform","docty":"Staff Appraisal Report","teratopic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Rural Development","count":"Algeria","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"North Africa!$!80464"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100212021504"},"subsc":"(Historic)Highways","admreg":"Middle East and North Africa,Middle East and North Africa","lang":"French","historic_topic":"Finance and Financial Sector Development,Transport,Rural Development","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Transportation","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Construction; Maintenance & repair; On\n            the job training; Planning; Roads & highways; Staff training,,"},"1":{"cdata!":"Construction; Maintenance & repair; On\n            the job training; Planning; Roads & highways; Staff training,,"}},"owner":"FFPSI Group (MNSIF)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"North Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"North Africa"}},"repnb":"1461","alt_title":{"0":{"cdata!":"Algerie - Evaluation D'un Deuxieme\n            Projet Routier"}}},"facets":{}}}
