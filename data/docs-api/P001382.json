The project revision was carried out in a\n            thorough and acceptable manner. The relationship between the\n            Bank and the executing agency was frank, but pleasant. The\n            project was not adequately prepared and the appraisal was\n            premature, which led to a major cost escalation and project\n            revision, which in turn caused a considerable delay in the\n            Implementation of the project. The revised project was\n            successful in achieving the physical targets. Due to good\n            management, the rehabilitation works by force account was a\n            successful operation. It is present Government policy that\n            it seeks to recover only operation and maintenance costs of\n            the water supply services. The Water and Sewage Plant (WSB)\n            is committed to work further towards this goal, but the\n            situation is not likely to substantially improve without\n            fundamental change in government pricing policy."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Lesotho -
