Some lessons learned included:\n            for project supported civil work, it is essential to obtain\n            land clearance of the construction site before the project\n            starts. The project provided a good lesson on why it is\n            important to have a well prepared construction site before\n            approval. It required a lot of efforts to get through\n            Government procedures to deal with land clearance and\n            authorization. Bank policy on social safeguards should be\n            strictly followed during project preparation and\n            implementation. The project provided a very good example of\n            the close relationship with and support to the\n            implementation of the national program. The project\n            activities were designed very much in line with the\n            Government priorities so that project outcomes directly\n            contributed to the improvement of the Government system.\n            Especially in a country as dynamic as Vietnam, it was\n            important to adopt a flexible approach to the project to be\n            able to respond to the important needs of the client when\n            needed and where they were consistent with the key\n            development objective of the project. Project design should\n            be less complex to facilitate implementation. Flexible and\n            in time solutions to tackle emergent issues and difficulties\n            during the implementation are essential to make the project move."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -

hospitals covered by the RBTCs; and the\n            proposed closing date extension will provide the needed\n            conditions to meet the PDO. The project will continue to aim\n            at meeting the increasing demand for safe blood transfusions\n            through funding the construction and equipment of RBTCs, to\n            provide reliable blood services for the project covered\n            areas and serve as models for future blood centers across\n            the country. However, instead of financing construction of\n            four RBTCs as envisaged at appraisal, it will finance the\n            construction and equipment of three RBTCs. The recently\n            built Blood Transfusion Center at the Ho Chi Minh City\n            (HCMC) Hematology Hospital, together with the Cho Ray\n            Hospital Blood Bank will provide blood services for HCMC as\n            well as the neighboring provinces. Therefore the\n            cancellation of the construction of HCMC RBTC will not\n            adversely affect the supply of the blood transfusion\n            services and blood products to the intended beneficiary\n            population. This will also prevent possible duplication with\n            the efforts that the local government is putting in place.\n            At appraisal it was determined that benefits of large up\n            front investments to improve blood safety will be maximized\n            by expanding output in only those blood centers with the\n            greatest potential of producing and utilizing the highest\n            volume of safe blood services."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Vietnam -
