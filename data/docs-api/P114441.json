Some\n            lessons learned includes: high level commitment, both by the\n            Bank and Government, is critical in preparing emergency\n            operations and increasing effectiveness. In the case of this\n            project, the multi-sector team composition was a strong\n            point. Based on this experience, the Government and the Bank\n            are in a better position to evaluate that an emergency\n            operation under Bank financing is more effective if it\n            finances a program that is already installed and reaches the\n            beneficiaries quickly. This Project had the opportunity to\n            inject resources into an existing program whose costs might\n            increase and whose ability to deliver services could decline\n            in a crisis. Another important lesson is that emergency\n            operations may provide an opportunity for crafting\n            longer-term responses to vulnerability. The project was used\n            as an opportunity to move forward the long-standing agenda\n            for developing emergency responses to food price crisis in a\n            country that constantly faces them and needs a comprehensive\n            long term response. Overall, sustained and continuous\n            fiduciary capacity building is needed for implementing\n            agencies in Nicaragua since they are critical to implement\n            emergency operations. The importance of monitoring and\n            evaluation should not be underestimated in emergency\n            operations. The Project had a strong focus and dedicated\n            institutional efforts and resources to use their own systems\n            to monitor the delivery of services on a timely basis."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Emergency Food Price Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Emergency Food Price\n            Response

This project is being restructured to increase\n            the scope of component one (school feeding) and decrease the\n            scope of component two (provision of seeds, fertilizer, and\n            training) in response to difficulties encountered in the\n            implementation of component two, the success of component\n            one, and the project's closing date of June 30, 2010.\n            To date, component one has financed the purchase of 115 days\n            of school feeding for 252,038 preschool and primary school\n            children, achieving the targets for this component.\n            Implementation of component two has lagged because the\n            droughts experienced since the third quarter of 2009 have\n            slowed the allocation of credits to small farmers and only\n            one sixth of the targeted farmers have benefited from the\n            integral package (seeds, fertilizers, technical, and\n            agricultural training). Given these results and the\n            limitations on performance under component two, US$1.7m is\n            being reallocated from component two to component one. Along\n            with the reallocation, the targets of the expected outcomes\n            indicators for the second year of the project will be\n            adjusted to reflect an increase in the number of school days\n            to finance with school feeding and to reduce all targets\n            related to component two."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Main report"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Emergency Food Price\n            Response Project : restructuring : Main report"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/2010/03/12086015/nicaragua-emergency-food-price-response-project-restructuring-main-report","projn":"NI-Price Vulnerability (Food Crisis)\n            /Former Product Id: P113225 -- P114441","docty":"Project Paper","subtopic":"Crops and Crop Management Systems,Education For All,Regional Economic Development,Food & Beverage Industry,Primary Education","teratopic":"Education,Industry,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","count":"Nicaragua","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Central America!$!80455"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000333037_20100413021849"},"theme":"Global food crisis response","subsc":"Crops,Other social services","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Education,Industry,Agriculture,Macroeconomics and Economic Growth","prdln":"Special Financing","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Agriculture, fishing, and forestry,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"Agricultural inputs, agricultural\n            production, agricultural training, Attendance rates,\n            Autonomous Regions, beans, Capacity building, fertilizer,\n            fertilizers, food consumption, FOOD PRICE, food security,\n            grains, maize, Number of schools, Nutrition Program,\n            planting, poor rural households, primary school, primary\n            school children, public primary schools, Regional Vice\n            President, Retention rates, school days, school feeding,\n            School Nutrition, school year, seed, seeds, small farmers,\n            sorghum, training materials, Yields"}},"owner":"Social Protection Sector (LCSHS)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Emergency Recovery Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"1":{"geo_region":"Central America"},"2":{"geo_region":"Central America"}},"majtheme":"Rural development","repnb":"53748"},"10170642":{"url":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2009/01/10170642/nicaragua-emergency-food-price-response-project","available_in":"English","url_friendly_title":"http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2009/01/10170642/nicaragua-emergency-food-price-response-project","new_url":"2009/01/10170642/nicaragua-emergency-food-price-response-project","disclosure_date":"2009-02-17T00:00:00Z","disclosure_type":"NA","disclosure_type_date":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","publishtoextweb_dt":"2010-07-01T00:00:00Z","disclstat":"Disclosed","txturl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/01/13/000333037_20090113231854/Rendered/INDEX/456720PJPR0IDA101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.txt","pdfurl":"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2009/01/13/000333037_20090113231854/Rendered/PDF/456720PJPR0IDA101OFFICIAL0USE0ONLY1.pdf","datestored":"2009-01-13T00:00:00Z","docdt":"2009-01-08T00:00:00Z","totvolnb":"1","versiontyp":"Buff cover","versiontyp_key":"1309937","volnb":"1","repnme":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Emergency Food Price Response Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"The objective of the Emergency Food\n            Price Response Project for Nicaragua are to mitigate the\n            negative nutritional impact of the food price increase on\n            pre-primary and primary school children and to promote poor\n            rural households' food security by increasing\n            agricultural production. Nicaragua has been severely hit by\n            the increase in food prices. Food inflation is amongst the\n            highest in the region, reaching an annual inflation rate of\n            28.8 percent in October 2008 after reaching a peak of 34.2\n            percent in August 2008. The vast majority of households in\n            Nicaragua are net food consumers, even in rural areas. This,\n            combined with the large share of expenditures devoted to\n            food in poor households' expenditures suggests that the\n            impact of the crisis on poverty will be dire. Recent\n            estimates place the decrease in real consumption for poor\n            urban households at around 16 percent. In response to the\n            food crisis, the Government of Nicaragua has adopted a\n            two-pronged strategy that to a large extent is consistent\n            with the recommendations issued by the Bank for countries\n            facing a food prices crisis emergency. This strategy\n            combines actions to support the most vulnerable groups of\n            the population and actions aimed at expanding the supply of\n            agricultural goods."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Nicaragua - Emergency Food Price Response Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Nicaragua - Emergency Food Price\n            Response
