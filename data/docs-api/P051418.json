Some lessons learned are suggested as\n            follows. Seeking change through consensus and participation\n            contributes to the sustainability of reform efforts. The\n            impact of this approach on sustainability of reforms is\n            clearly visible in provider uptake of hospital payment\n            reforms, and quality of care improvements. Nonetheless, the\n            Ministry of Health would have benefited from technical\n            support on communication, and marketing of health reforms.\n            Although there is relatively good institutional capacity in\n            Slovenia (information systems, human capital), the country\n            had adopted a phased approach to implementing diagnostic\n            related groups (DRGs). There are many benefits to this\n            phased approach. It has allowed fine-tuning of health\n            information systems, and training to meet the needs of DRG\n            implementation, and, providers are getting used to the\n            technical details of implementing DRGs. The Project was\n            designed as a flexible operation with clear end-points. In\n            partnership with the Bank, the country was able to adapt\n            project investments to support key areas of health system\n            improvement that were consistent with the policy priorities\n            of the country, and for which there was support among the\n            key stakeholders. The important lesson to be drawn from this\n            project experience is that, in cases where there are\n            significant information components, more time should be\n            devoted by the Borrower and the Bank to understanding the\n            legal, institutional and political constraints to\n            implementing integrated information systems, and then using\n            this information in the design of the information systems component."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Slovenia -
