It is\n            one of the world's poorest countries, with a population\n            of about 2.1 million. The economy is substantially dependent\n            on South Africa as a source of income, employment and\n            foreign exchange. Most of Lesotho's land area is\n            mountainous and ill-suited for agriculture, but there is an\n            abundance of water. In the early 1980s, less than 6 percent\n            of its water was consumed domestically, with the remainder\n            running through South Africa to the sea. South Africa, on\n            the other hand, was chronically short of bulk water -\n            particularly in the country's industrial heartland of\n            Gauteng, some 400 km north of Lesotho. The Treaty committed\n            the two countries to implement phases 1A and 1B of the\n            Lesotho's Highlands Water Project (LHWP), transferring\n            water in the amount of 18 m/sec and 12 m/sec, respectively,\n            and left the subsequent phases open for further\n            negotiations. Phases IA and IB have made use of the\n            comparative advantages of Lesotho and South Africa to the\n            mutual benefit of both countries - with Gauteng receiving\n            much needed water, and Lesotho receiving revenues from water\n            export and hydropower. Future phases of the LHDP envisioning\n            additional water transfers to South Africa may be delayed. A\n            main reason is that South Africa in the mid-1990s, with\n            World Bank help, started to focus less on engineering\n            solutions to supply water to meet growing needs and more on\n            measures for managing water demand. In the longer-term, the\n            LHWP may still continue to be a key underpinning for\n            Gauteng's and Lesotho's future development."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Creating benefits from cooperation in shared\n            water resources : Lesotho's highlands water project\n            phases IA and IB"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Creating benefits from\n            cooperation in shared water resources : Lesotho's\n            highlands water project phases IA and IB"}],"listing_relative_url":"/research/2008/12/13025769/creating-benefits-cooperation-shared-water-resources-lesothos-highlands-water-project-phases-ia-ib","projn":"LS-Hiland Water 1b Project -- P001409,LS-Highland Wtr.I -- P001396","subtopic":"Water Use,Town Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Supply and Sanitation Governance\n            and Institutions,Water Conservation,Water and Industry","docty":"Brief","teratopic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","count":"Lesotho","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"Sub-Saharan Africa!$!80473"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000356161_20101108022532"},"subsc":"Central government administration,Water supply,Roads and highways,Power,Other social services","admreg":"Africa,Africa","colti":"Water feature stories ; issue no. 12","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Water Supply and Sanitation,Water Resources","prdln":"IBRD/IDA","seccl":"Public","sectr":"Public Administration, Law, and Justice,Water, sanitation and flood protection,Transportation,Energy and mining,Health and other social services","majdocty":"Publications & Research","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abundance of water, bulk water, capacity\n            building, construction, cost savings, environmental impacts,\n            environmental issues, export, hydropower, inter-basin\n            transfers, large water storage, programs, public works,\n            regional water management, River Basin, Rivers, sale of\n            water, sea, transparency, water demand, Water Projects,\n            Water Resources, water sales, Water Sector, water shortages,\n            water storage, water transfers"}},"owner":"Urban Dev. & Services Prac 1 (AFTU1)","lndinstr":{"0":{"cdata!":"Specific Investment Loan"}},"geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"1":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"},"2":{"geo_region":"Sub-Saharan Africa"}},"trustfund":"TF023410-SIDA CTF FOR ENVIRONMENT,TF023550-GLO.
