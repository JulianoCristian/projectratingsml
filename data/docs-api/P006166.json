(The flexibility of\n            project design and credit agreements allowed quick,\n            extensive changes to be made, which drastically improved\n            project performance). 3) Creating an organizational culture\n            based on participation, open dialogue, team work, client\n            orientation, and the use of total quality management\n            techniques leads to increased productivity. 4) Strong\n            commitment among high government levels has to exist in\n            order for there to be enforceable sub-contracts between\n            government agencies. 5) If the administrative and financial\n            department has weaknesses, it is useful to enlist an\n            internal auditor with experience in Bank procurement\n            procedures. 6) It is crucial to ensure that the terms of\n            reference are well-written, that only qualified consultants\n            are hired, that construction guides and procedural manuals\n            are developed and applied."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia -

The project would: (a)\n            support the extension of basic health services; (b) improve\n            the effectiveness of basic health services; and (c)\n            strengthen central policy making and coordination of\n            investment in health. Specifically, the project would\n            include three components. First, a service delivery\n            component consists of extending maternal and child care in\n            the marginal and low-income areas of La Paz, El Alto,\n            Cochabamba and Santa Cruz. The credit would finance the\n            extension of pre- and post-natal care, reproductive health\n            care, child development and nutritional control, prevention\n            and control of diarrheal and respiratory diseases. The\n            credit would also finance construction, rehabilitation,\n            equipment and management of health centers. The second\n            component is human resources development consisting of the\n            development of decentralized training capacity, training and\n            supervision of selected staff, and health education\n            campaigns. The third component is institutional development\n            covering the reorganization of the Ministry of Social\n            Welfare and Public Health (MPSSP), in its Planning, Human\n            Resources, Administration and General directorates, and in\n            the regional units involved in the project."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Bolivia - Integrated Health Development Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Bolivia - Integrated Health\n            Development Project"}],"listing_relative_url":"/projects/documents/1989/12/737354/bolivia-integrated-health-development-project","projn":"BO-Integrated Hlth Dev -- P006166","docty":"Memorandum & Recommendation of the President","subtopic":"Health Monitoring & Evaluation,Regional Rural Development,Health Systems Development & Reform,Health Economics & Finance,Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems","teratopic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","count":"Bolivia","geo_region_mdks":{"0":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"1":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"},"2":{"geo_region_mdk":"America!$!80450"}},"entityids":{"entityid":"000009265_3960928093540"},"subsc":"Health,Central government administration","admreg":"Latin America & Caribbean,Latin America & Caribbean","lang":"English","historic_topic":"Health, Nutrition and Population","seccl":"Public","sectr":"(Historic)Health, Nutrition & Population","majdocty":"Project Documents","keywd":{"0":{"cdata!":"abortion,basic health care,basic health\n            services,beds,child development,cities,disease\n            control,doctors,equipment,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,extension,Financial Management,Health\n            Care,health care providers,health care services,Health\n            Centers,health conditions,health education,health\n            expenditure,health facilities,health indicators,health\n            institutions,health sector,health services,high\n            fertility,households,income,Infant mortality,infectious\n            diseases,Integrated Health Care,Life\n            expectancy,Malnutrition,medical\n            supplies,mortality,mothers,NGOs,non- governmental\n            organizations,private sector,Public Health,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,rural areas,rural population,service\n            delivery,social development,social services,Social\n            Welfare,supervision,urban areas,vaccination"},"1":{"cdata!":"abortion,basic health care,basic health\n            services,beds,child development,cities,disease\n            control,doctors,equipment,essential\n            drugs,expenditures,extension,Financial Management,Health\n            Care,health care providers,health care services,Health\n            Centers,health conditions,health education,health\n            expenditure,health facilities,health indicators,health\n            institutions,health sector,health services,high\n            fertility,households,income,Infant mortality,infectious\n            diseases,Integrated Health Care,Life\n            expectancy,Malnutrition,medical\n            supplies,mortality,mothers,NGOs,non- governmental\n            organizations,private sector,Public Health,public\n            sector,rehabilitation,rural areas,rural population,service\n            delivery,social development,social services,Social\n            Welfare,supervision,urban areas,vaccination"}},"owner":"Health Sector (LCSHH)","geo_regions":{"0":{"geo_region":"America"},"1":{"geo_region":"America"},"2":{"geo_region":"America"}},"trustfund":"TF024852-SOCIAL SECTORS UNIT IN LA PAZ,TF024849-HUMAN RESOURCES UNIT IN LA PAZ,TF031471-BOLIVIA - HEALTH,TF025268-PHRD-SECOND INTEGRATED HEALTH\n            DEVELOPMENT PROJECT","repnb":"P5113"},"facets":{}}}
