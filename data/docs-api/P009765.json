For this purpose, a package of services was provided:\n            nutrition education, primary health care, supplementary\n            on-site feeding of children who were severely malnourished\n            or whose growth was found to be faltering, education for\n            diarrhea management, administration of vitamin A, periodic\n            deforming, and supplementary feeding of a limited number of\n            women. A principal characteristic of this project was the\n            use of growth monitoring through monthly weighing of all\n            children 6-36 months old to target delivery of these\n            nutrition and health services to needy children and to serve\n            as an educational device for mothers.
