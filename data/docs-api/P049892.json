Pension and Social Assistance Project"},"abstracts":{"cdata!":"Ratings for the Pension and Social\n            Assistance Project for Azerbaijan were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: reform is concerned not only with technical and\n            institutional improvements, but relies heavily on the\n            political process. Leadership and ownership of the reforms\n            pursued by the project were crucial to its success. In the\n            case of the Project, there was strong commitment not only\n            from the Minister of the Ministry of Labor and Social\n            Protection of the Population (MLSPP) and the Chairman of the\n            State Social Protection Fund, but also from the Ministries\n            of Finance and Economy to bring about reform which were\n            crucial in the adoption of legislation and amendments to\n            pertinent laws and regulatory acts. The probability of\n            success in any reform is higher where there is a reform\n            champion, but broader support is needed for sustainability.\n            To institutionalize new systems, processes and practices\n            ensuring sustainability of ownership by the implementing\n            agencies is also essential. Providing continuous guidance\n            and actively engaging with counterparts in seeking solutions\n            to challenges as they arose was critical in the successful\n            implementation of the Project. A focus on identifying\n            problems and seeking solutions as a coherent, collaborative\n            World Bank client team was important for achieving results.\n            With limited experience in implementation of the World\n            Bank's procurement guidelines and financial management\n            requirements, it was important for the World Bank to provide\n            on-the-job training and to make available training\n            courses/workshops to build the capacity of the PIUs in\n            procurement and financial management. Good Public Relations\n            (PR) campaigns on ongoing reforms earned civil society trust\n            in the reform. In the case of the Project, the government\n            reached out to the population to gather information on the\n            performance of the system and used it to improve their\n            performance. It made a consistent effort to implement\n            information campaigns to convey to the general public the\n            content of the reforms under implementation, build trust in\n            the public sector and enhance accountability. Developing\n            adequate monitoring systems is crucial for the\n            sustainability of the programs. The Project supported the\n            development of databases and the Management Information\n            System (MIS) for both institutions as basic tools to improve\n            efficiency and effectiveness of the social protection\n            programs. The leadership of both institutions was committed\n            to continue deepening the efforts to develop their\n            monitoring and evaluation systems to sustain the system and\n            programs in the long term. The ongoing Social Protection\n            Development Project (SPDP) is further supporting these efforts."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Azerbaijan - Pension and Social Assistance
