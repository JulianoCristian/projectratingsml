Lessons\n            address, the need for a realistic assessment of constraints\n            in project design, recognizing those constraints which can\n            be mitigated by project design, not assuming that\n            improvements will definitely achieve the expected results in\n            educational outcomes. This translated first, into the\n            limited involvement in project design of line units, who\n            were expected to implement the project, but who only\n            demonstrated lack of project ownership, a circumstance\n            aggravated by significant staff turnover. Second, project\n            interventions designed early on, could have overcome\n            structural constraints, working around them to achieve\n            better results. However, this would have required the full\n            involvement of line units at the project design stage, which\n            would have required more time for project preparation, and\n            would perhaps, have recognized that modest project\n            objectives - narrowing the project scope - could have\n            improved implementation results."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Turkey -
