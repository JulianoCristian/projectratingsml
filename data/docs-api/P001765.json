It\n            was successful in establishing extension networks for\n            restoring Government agricultural services, and\n            contributions were made to sector and sub-sector planning,\n            namely, on reform analysis for cashew processing and\n            marketing. Nevertheless, poor project design, and, limited\n            and delayed implementation, coupled with failed production\n            objectives, hindered success. Furthermore, minimal progress\n            was achieved in reversing development constraints for both,\n            producers and processors. The key lessons convey that\n            projects should provide a platform to support policy\n            reforms, particularly in countries where macroeconomic and\n            agricultural policies are not in place. Project success\n            cannot be guaranteed without effective implementation of\n            policy frameworks, which would prod disbursement of project\n            funds. Consideration to technical assistance, training and\n            research, require priority design, to restore production\n            constraints in the agricultural sub-sector, and, be in tune\n            with the overall institutional capacity. Hence, fundamental\n            actions/activities for project development, need to be\n            incorporated in project design to ensure accountability, and\n            be responsive to the prevailing context. Timely provision of\n            counterpart funds is essential, particularly for\n            agricultural operations; thus projects require an\n            appropriate scale, and a proactive management to achieve sustainability."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Mozambique -

           nuts and restore exports to their levels of the seventies;\n            (b) make small- and medium-scale agricultural enterprises\n            more efficient and profitable; and (c) strengthen local\n            capacity to formulate and implement long-term growth\n            strategies for the irrigation and cashew subsectors.  The\n            project components include: (a) rehabilitation and\n            development of the cashew subsector; (b) assistance to\n            agricultural enterprises; and (c) specific subsectoral\n            studies and surveys.  Under the first component, financing\n            will be provided for: (a) equipment, incremental costs and\n            technical assistance to agricultural extension, research,\n            and cashew nut nurseries and to the state secretariat; (b)\n            investment credit to commercial farmers and traders and for\n            cashew processing factories.  Because women play a dominant\n            role in agriculture and cashew marketing, a survey will be\n            carried out to assess factors determining the agricultural\n            productivity of women and measures to be taken to enhance\n            benefits accruing to them.  Under the second component,\n            financing for technical assistance, incremental costs, and\n            equipment will be provided to develop a capacity within the\n            Ministry of Agriculture to address the rehabilitation needs\n            of agricultural enterprises and provide them with managerial\n            and planning assistance and training.
