Some lessons learned included: the project\n            reflects the numerous and often painful lessons learnt from\n            now 30 years of Bank support to civil service reforms:\n            projects of this kind need to be much more focused and in\n            line with the country's context and administrative\n            capacity. The phasing of reform needs to ensure that the\n            basic human and financial resources management functions and\n            processes are in place or addressed before envisaging\n            complex IT solutions. The approach needs to be more\n            incremental and opportunistic, thus requiring more\n            flexibility. Given the highly political nature and\n            sensitivity of government reengineering and civil service\n            reforms, their feasibility needs to be based on a thorough\n            analysis of the country's political economy,\n            governance, and corruption situation. Whenever, public\n            employment plays an essential welfare function, like in\n            Yemen and many other countries, credible alternatives, such\n            as social transfers or safety nets need to be envisaged to\n            alleviate the social impact of streamlining and thus\n            opposition to the reform. At operational level, this project\n            highlights the importance of specific and realistic results\n            framework, based on a reform strategy with a detailed and\n            time bound implementation plan and informed by an\n            appropriate monitoring and evaluation system at project\n            level. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangement\n            need to be clear from the start. It further, shows the\n            importance of a detailed and candid risk analysis and a\n            realistic assessment of the mitigating measures. The\n            project's ambitions and scope need to reflect this risk\n            assessment. It also shows the need for continuity in project\n            management and an ongoing dialogue with the project\n            counterparts and main stakeholders.

The additional financing will help finance\n            the costs associated with scaling up the activities to\n            enhance the impact of an important project for Yemen's\n            overall development. Specifically, investments will: (i)\n            provide support for the continuation of the reengineering\n            process in selected line departments; (ii) assist with the\n            expansion of the Human Resource Database beyond the civil\n            service to include employees in the armed forces, judiciary,\n            and the security services, the establishment of a\n            comprehensive Human Resource Management System, and the roll\n            out of the Accounting and Financial Management System to all\n            ministries and agencies in Sana'a; and (iii) support\n            the revision of all current relevant legislation to\n            strengthen the rule of law, meritocracy, and performance\n            orientation in public employment. The loan was designed to\n            provide support to the civil service modernization process\n            which began in the aftermath of Yemen's unification\n            following the end of the civil war. The Government's\n            comprehensive strategy for modernizing its civil service\n            focused on developing a workforce that efficiently and\n            effectively provides a reduced complement of government\n            services while supporting growth in the private and\n            nongovernmental sectors. The aims of the reforms are to\n            improve the operational transparency of the civil service,\n            by fostering an environment where performance measurement\n            serves as the key management tool and where the merit\n            principle is used as the basis for hiring and promoting\n            staff. Under the streamlining and rationalization component,\n            project development objectives have also been exceeded.\n            Accomplishments include: (i) the enforcement of retirement\n            rules and the referral to the pension authorities of\n            approximately 67,000 individuals who had effectively passed\n            the retirement age, more than doubling the pension\n            system's enrolment; and (ii) the exclusion from the\n            payroll of approximately 11,000 individuals whose main\n            activity was working for political parties but were\n            considered government employees."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Yemen - Civil Service Modernization Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Yemen - Civil Service\n            Modernization
