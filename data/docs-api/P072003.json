Ratings\n            for the Second Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project\n            (PRSC II) for Benin are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was rated moderately satisfactory. Ratings for\n            the Third Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project (PRSC\n            III) for Benin are as follows: outcome was moderately\n            satisfactory, risk to the development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was rated moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: 1) selectivity and simplicity of the\n            design are essential to the success of the operation.\n            Obstacles due to administrative resistance to change, as\n            well as due to lack of capacity cannot be underestimated. It\n            is better to start with a very selective matrix and enlarge\n            progressively, building on success in some components. There\n            is also a need to be realistic about the scope and pace of\n            reform; 2) it is important to properly align the PRSC with\n            budget management, so that the priority components of the\n            PRSC and the performance budgets of those ministries are\n            supportive of each other. It is also important that budget\n            support be phased with the budget cycle, in order to\n            properly impact on budget composition, and to provide budget\n            support in a timely manner; 3) the effectiveness of the\n            PRSCs in supporting sector reforms can be highly increased\n            by using a sector wide approach, as was successfully\n            experienced in rural water supply. The approach federated\n            donors around the government's objectives and allowed a\n            mix of central government programs, decentralized programs,\n            budget support and projects to combine efficiently; and 4)\n            PRSCs (I-III) rightly focused on the critical areas of\n            governance and basic service delivery. Future PRSCs need to\n            deepen support in the areas of reforms where progress has\n            been slow and focus on critical bottlenecks rather than\n            broadening the areas of

modest institutional development impact, and\n            satisfactory performances by both Bank and Borrower. The\n            following are findings and implications for subsequent\n            operations: 1) The work under a prior operation in\n            developing government experience in results-budgeting was\n            highly instrumental in successfully implementing the\n            project. Nevertheless, monitoring and evaluation capacity in\n            most ministries was still fragile and limited. Team dialogue\n            with Government should devote greater attention to the\n            result-framework and indicators, and to related capacity\n            building activities. The main stakeholders'\n            understanding of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC)\n            process and requirements was fragile and required\n            improvements over time. Greater team efforts to expand\n            stakeholder understanding and ownership would have improved\n            the environment for subsequent operations. Donor\n            coordination mechanisms needed to be enhanced so as to lay\n            the ground for greater harmonization of procedures. Such\n            harmonization was essential both to simplify messages for\n            Government but also to enhance the efficiency of reform\n            programs and of donor support. Starting with three sectors\n            was an ambitious beginning, and for the included themes the\n            policy matrix was quite long and detailed. It would be\n            better for the team and Government to work to simplify the matrix."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin -

Key\n            safeguard issues are mainly related to the drilling of wells\n            for the rural water supply, and medical waste generation and\n            handling. Such impacts are expected to be modest and\n            reversible through mitigation measures. Activities related\n            to forests and adjacent lands management are part of broader\n            programs spanning a five-year period, although those\n            activities planned for this project do not appear to\n            generate any adverse environmental impacts. Hence the\n            environmental and social management plan for PRSC-2 will\n            include appropriate guidance aimed at mitigating expected\n            negative impacts. Sector-specific measures aimed at\n            mitigating negative impacts forPRSC-1 include the following:\n            To protect the water supply, complete a mandatory impact\n            assessment for the dam; avoid unsanitary sites (cemeteries,\n            cattle pens, etc); control wastewater and mud around wells;\n            sensitize users about hygiene; and impose restrictions on\n            the distance between well and latrines. To manage medical\n            wastes, train personnel, acquire health care equipment and\n            use incinerators. To reduce impacts surrounding urban\n            sanitation, help update the 1998 master sanitation plan by\n            selecting high priority low-income areas where urgent\n            improvement of sanitation services is needed in order to\n            reduce the burden of environment-related diseases. However\n            investments in earthworks and dam construction will not\n            start until 2005."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Poverty Reduction Support Credit\n            Project :

designed to help implement the Benin's\n            December 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), by\n            supporting key policy measures aiming at: a) bolstering the\n            medium-term macroeconomic framework; b) improving service\n            delivery; and, c) enhancing governance and institutional\n            capacity. The focus of the project will be on further\n            supporting selective cross-cutting themes, critical to\n            improving service delivery, in particular, the public\n            expenditure management reform, undertaken under the Public\n            Expenditure Reform Adjustment Credit. Attention shall be\n            given to three core sectors: rural water, health, and basic\n            education. In addition to these three sectors, the project\n            would support continuation on the implementation of the\n            Environment and Urban Sanitation, and Forest Management\n            programs, ensuring proper funding, execution and monitoring.\n            While the programmatic approach should increase Benin's\n            ownership of its development programs, strengthen budgetary\n            institutions and reduce transactions costs in the delivery\n            of external assistance, in addition to the promotion of\n            inter-sectoral coordination, maximizing the impact on\n            poverty reduction, risks could influence project outcomes.\n            This entails the economy's vulnerability to falling\n            cotton prices, which may hamper growth and significant\n            reduction in poverty, in addition to the economic and\n            political developments in Nigeria. Further risks are\n            possible slippages in key reforms, weak institutional\n            capacity; and, fiduciary risks. However, these risks have\n            been mitigated by the strength of the Government's\n            ownership and commitment to implement the proposed measures,\n            and significant up-front actions."},"docna":{"cdata!":"Benin - Poverty Reduction Support Credit Project"},"display_title":[{"display_title":"Benin - Poverty Reduction Support\n            Credit
